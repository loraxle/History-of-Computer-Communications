This interview gives exciting insight into the early days of Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) and how the overlapping networks of individuals enabled talented individuals to be found and recruited both to PARC and to ever-changing project needs within PARC. David, a friend of Bob Metcalfe’s, would play an important role in Xerox’s decision to place its Ethernet patents into the public domain, and to the forming of the DIX (Digital Equipment Corporation—Intel—Xerox) partnership that would deal with, in David’s words, “the howling mob of the IEEE 802 Committee.” The connection made in this interview led to a future collaboration with James L. Pelkey and Liddle at the Santa Fe Institute.

Keywords: DIX (Digital Equipment Corporation—Intel—Xerox), Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), Ethernet, Arpanet, Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
