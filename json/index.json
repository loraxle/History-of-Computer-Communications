      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine, but as recent as 1965, computer scientists were uncertain how best to interconnect even two computers. The notion that within a few decades the challenge would be how to interconnect millions of computers around the globe was too farfetched to even contemplate. Yet by 1988 that is precisely what was happening. The products and protocols through which they communicated would look crude and incomplete by standards of today, but they worked well enough to demonstrate the latent productivity in sharing information electronically between computers and application programs of potentially every kind. How did such revolutionary innovation occur? Why were the two dominant corporations in communications and computers, American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph and International Business Machines, the two corporations expected to control the future of computer communications and the models of corporate innovation, left surviving as marginal market participants? How had entrepreneurs seized market leadership?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such were the questions that perplexed me in 1987. To find answers I began interviewing scientists and entrepreneurs. My intention was to write a history of Computer Communications for the years 1968 to 1988 based on the insights I gained from those interviewed. Only I quickly learned that there was no one history that could do justice to the revolutionary changes that had and were occurring. I then began compiling the stories that had been shared with me into a historical narrative, hoping to capture the inspirations and unending challenges of those who created many of the leading companies and dominant technologies, while remaining faithful to the “facts” of what had happened. To recreate a sense of the uncertainty each person or organization faced, as well as to give the reader the freedom to explore the history as fit one’s interest, the reconstruction assumed the form of a series of overlapping hypertext blocks organized within time. While this format provides a rich context for reader exploration, it does not lend itself to being published as a traditional book. Thus this website. I invite you to explore and come to your own conclusions as to what happened and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reader is directed to the Introduction for a fuller discussion of the book organization but, briefly, this historical reconstruction views the evolution of Computer Communications from 1968 to 1988 as the emergence of three unique market sectors: Data Communications, Networking and Internetworking. Data Communications emerged between 1968 and 1972 after the Carterfone decision of the Federal Communication Commission in 1968 and is defined by two major technologies and product categories: modems and multiplexers. Networking emerged between 1979 and 1982 when firms introduced local area networks (LANs) and dataPBXs in response to the needs of corporations to interconnect their growing base of computers and peripherals. The need of corporations to interconnect their LANs into wide area networks (WANs) prompted the emergence of Internetworking between 1984 and 1988. A principal focus of interest will be why did the hundreds of companies that entered each market self-organize into oligopolies selling dominant designs? And why did new firms, venture capital-backed entrepreneurial start-ups, come to dominant each new market sector? The schema of market evolution is presented broadly as: (1) the time of Visionaries, (2) reducing an idea to a working proof, (3) technological diffusion, (4) market emergence, (5) market competition, (6) the emergence of market order and (7) market adaption and co-evolution. The Networking market is observed through the whole cycle in the most detail from the idea of packet switching to the Arpanet and onto LANs. The reader can quickly access the book by each market sector’s stage using the right-side panel of accordions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within time and market sector, the roughly three hundred hypertext blocks are additionally indexed by one or more of the following topics: institutional activity, organization, technology, product and or individual. For example, within Networking between 1979-1981 is the block Robert Metcalfe and the Founding of 3Com. By using the index of links, this block can be found through Networking (a market sector), 3Com (an organization) and/or Ethernet (a technology or product). By using the Search Engine, it can also be found by searching for Robert Metcalfe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the book, this site also consists of much of the source material, including the 85 interviews that are being donated to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have three choices as to how to access the material:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Read the book, either as presented or by jumping to blocks of interest. The book can be accessed by using links on either the left, right or bottom panels.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Explore the book or source material by a topic of interest by using the hypertext links found on the left panel.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;By using the Search Engine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the stories of some of the many heroes of this history. This work would not be possible without the generous time those I interviewed gave me in 1988 or their willingness to make their interviews public now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, James L.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurial capitalism flourishes in the presence of economic opportunity, readily available venture capital, and the intrepid human spirit. Entrepreneurs inspire others to join them in the pursuit of their dreams. Ignoring the unforgiving odds stacked against them, they commit precious human capital and scarce venture capital to birthing new companies in the hopes of achieving success. A complex set of conditions and actions leads from a new idea to an excited entrepreneur recruiting others, raising venture capital and starting a new company; to hundreds of companies all competing to succeed and prosper; to a few large companies dominating multi-billion dollar markets; and then to virtually all once high-profile Initial Public Offerings disappearing or sliding into the realm of the living dead. When a company succeeds, the world may never be the same, for its products and services may change the way we live and work and even what it means to be human. This book observes entrepreneurial capitalism and the emergence of computer communications. It is a story of how isolated computers came to be interconnected into vast networks, creating the infrastructure necessary for the modern information economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How technologies become the engines of economic growth is poorly understood. Even so, experts tell us that the ability to raise the standard of living for all peoples without exhausting the capacity of Earth’s ecosystem rests with our abilities to convert sciences into technologies and then into jobs producing the requisite and sustainable products. As much sense as that linkage makes, few experience how it works in practice or know what can be done to make it function more effectively. Trusting the process to government has been replete with failure, and yet throwing our fates to the workings of market competition seems uncertain and a bumpy ride. Yet when asked the question “How can we best ensure economic growth?” most of us would answer: market competition. The economic history of computer communications from 1968 through 1988 allows us to observe the dynamics of how individuals and ideas gave rise to new products and corporations that compete in major new markets – not once, but three times. Data Communications, Networking and Internetworking reveal the complex economic web of government and markets as well as the joyful wonder of human beings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a partner with the investment bank Montgomery Securities in the mid-1980s. It was a time when futurists were envisioning the world exiting the industrial economy and entering the information economy. It was an exciting time as evidenced by the increased venture capital investing and the creation of thousands of new companies. My partners and I persuaded institutional investors to trust us with a percentage of their funds earmarked for venture capital. However, when it came time to invest, our review of countless business plans found most companies only incrementally innovating on what already existed; few were pursuing radical innovations. Why? When I reflected on a new order arriving and the lack of truly radical innovation, I felt confused. I decided to talk to experts in a field that I knew was rapidly changing and in which I had personal experience: computer communications. Soon the idea of writing a history of 1968 to 1988 emerged. During these two decades, revolutionary changes in the ways corporations used computers drove unprecedented needs for computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a technical book. Any reader should be able to understand what differentiates one computer communication technology from the next. A technology will be defined simply as the embodiment of knowledge into product, a “black box,” if you will. Users see the black box from the outside and need to know little about how it is designed or built, they merely want to employ the product to their advantage. This history focuses on the nature of the inside of computer communication black boxes: products that enable computer products to interconnect and transmit data over networks. The “inside” of computer communication products consists of two parts: the hardware and software that effect reliable communication of digital data, bits (zeros or ones), and the protocols required to make sense of the bits being transmitted. Hardware and software innovations were directly linked to advances in semiconductor technology, and to mastering the reduction of entire products into semiconductor chips. In this book I will describe the innovation of numerous computer communication products. Communication protocols, specifically internetworking protocols, also will be of central interest. In 1968, networking protocols did not exist for there were no computer networks, only computer peripherals connected to dedicated computers. With the advent of computer networks, however, more complex protocols had to be created so data could be sent and received reliably by many computers. These protocols had to be evolved again when there were networks of computers interconnected to other networks of computers. The evolution from no protocols to networking then internetworking protocols will be a series of technology innovations closely observed. The two decades from 1968 to 1988 were exciting times in computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.1/Entrepreneurial-Capitalism/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1968, it was thought that only large corporations could amass the investment capital required to undertake the uncertain process of creating new knowledge to then be managed into innovative products, sales, jobs and the ultimate goal of economic growth. No two companies better represented this economic model than American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph and International Business Machines. American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;amp;T) was the largest corporation in the world and controlled roughly 90% of telecommunications in the United States. A regulated monopoly since 1913, AT&amp;amp;T legally kept competition at bay while simultaneously turning a deaf ear to the needs of computer users. On the other hand, International Business Machines (IBM) had won its near monopoly position in computers by dint of market competition. Notwithstanding that competitors protested about IBM’s unfair practices such as prohibiting use of non-IBM software or attachment of non-IBM products to IBM computers. Each firm had built enviable research laboratories, touted as the source of unending innovation. No one had any doubt the future of communications and computers belonged to the coming battle between these two economic behemoths. But the battle never came. Instead fearless entrepreneurs rushed their ramparts with new products and services until both AT&amp;amp;T and IBM lost their Olympian holds on markets they once ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the new ideas that would transform both computers and communication came not from private investment but from government funding. That knowledge was then public so that any firm or individual could attempt to appropriate its economic value. This history is filled with entrepreneurs seeing the promise of these radical ideas when large corporations disregarded their value or attempted to prevent their adoption in order to protect their own products or systems. What made the time of this history different was the emerging availability of venture capital to fund entrepreneurs chasing their dreams. Entrepreneurs by the hundreds and then thousands, all of whom would then have to endure the test of intense market competition before claiming the prize awarded to the fittest: Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This new engine of economic growth – innovation, entrepreneurs, venture capital, market competition, accessible public equity markets – differed radically from the model of economic growth that prevailed on the eve of this history: corporate capitalism. Entrepreneurial capitalism would find unending opportunities in information technologies and, in our focus, computer communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it is impossible to reconstruct all of what happened in computer communications from 1968 to 1988. Given the perspective of time, those technologies and firms that were the most successful have become clear, and it will be those histories that will be reconstructed. Even so, even one firm’s history could fill this volume. So a further reduction of all that happened is necessary, a task that is aided by the narrative schema about to be described. Even so, the histories of over twenty companies will be told, and six firm histories will be reconstructed in sufficient detail to elaborate the schema.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.2/From-Ideas-to-Entrepreneurs-to-Adaptive-Corporations/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The creation of new knowledge precedes the possibility of new ideas leading to new products holding economic promise. So we must first understand how new knowledge is created and diffused in order to understand the process of technological innovation becoming economic growth. Consequently, the history of computer communications begins long before working high-speed modems or an Arpanet. Retracing the experiences of individuals and the source of their inspirations and ideas is a reoccurring theme throughout this history. For the mental models of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs are deeply embedded in their formative experiences and thus invariably shape their ability to adapt their perspectives onto an ever-changing competitive landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs are people who imagine the world differently and induce others to help them bring it into being with new enabling products. The entrepreneurs in this history are largely economic entrepreneurs who envision products or systems they, and the team they recruit, can develop and commercialize usually with the aid of outside venture capitalists. Two characteristics distinguish an entrepreneur: vision and leadership. Vision is seeing economic opportunity latent in the benefits a new technology brings to satisfy unmet customer needs. Those unmet needs may be either manifest or anticipated to happen in their future. Leadership is the ability to convince others to follow and to work in pursuit of the shared vision. No new idea can be developed and then brought to market by an individual by him or herself. To do so requires the collaboration of many people working together as a team bonded in part by sharing ownership of the new firm by way of stock options. After recruiting the key engineers and marketing people to join him, the entrepreneur and his team then write a business plan that sets out their intentions, timing of events and the amount of cash, or investment, needed to see them through to either profitability or an event of such importance that it will be possible to raise more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the corporation the entrepreneur and team will form has entered the Collective stage. After writing the business plan, their next task is the daunting challenge of raising the money needed to fund product development and organizational start-up costs. It was this act that changed so dramatically in the late-1960s with the emergence of institutional venture capital. For the first time, large pools of risk capital became available to be invested in the formation of new companies. Venture capitalists invest capital for shares of corporate ownership in expectation that the shares will be worth considerably more in the future, so much so, that the shares will be able to be sold either to the public in an IPO or to an acquiring firm. Most efforts by entrepreneurs fail to complete the Collective stage because they are unable to raise the needed venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If capital is raised, the corporation enters the Emergent stage of development. Two tasks are essential to this stage: self-organization and product creation. Self-organization refers to the organization not simply functioning at the directive of the entrepreneur, but becoming a well coordinated, multi-disciplined, tightly focused, and highly motivated group sharing a common purpose. If this does not happen, the organization never develops the ability to execute the complex set of decisions and actions required to grow an organization. Product creation does not mean the perfection of a product, only the creation of product that can be sold and used by customers for the intended purpose and that the customer will buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Competitive stage comes next and begins with product shipment and ends when the corporation has attained profitability. Few start-ups ever successfully attain completion of this stage. Profitability, or more precisely positive free cash flow, is the essential goal for only then is management freed from having to raise more venture capital to subsidize negative cash flow. The Competitive stage can be the most stressful for the entrepreneur for often he or she is often deemed no longer able to manage the complexity of a business but cast in the role of product visionary and replaced by a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with a proven track record of effective managerial leadership. For the management of the rare few corporations that can reach profitability, the golden prize, the option to go public, is possible. Becoming a public company raises always-needed capital and gives shareholders an opportunity to sell their shares for a profit. The IPO is a singular event in the life of a corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Persistent stage that follows profitability can last for many years, depending on the length of time customers will continue to purchase the products the company is innovating. This stage is particularly characterized by incremental innovation as management tries to capture market share from marginal competitors. What is critical to this stage is that management navigates the company to another technology base rather than remaining mired in the technology paradigm first innovated. If the company can’t compete successfully in more than one technology, then the company can be thought to exhibit structural inertia. This phenomenon occurs repeatedly in this history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those even more unique corporations whose personnel can make the successful leap to a new technology, the corporation enters the Adaptive stage. Yet even this unique accomplishment may not be sufficient to ensure perpetual success, financial as well as technical. In some sense, it is this issue that creates the economic breathing room for start-ups to beat existing firms to new opportunities, even when the management of existing firms are fully aware of the potential for a new technology. More often than not, the desire of larger firms to make the transition to a new technology is the inspiration, or necessity, to acquire another firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in spite of all the travails and successes of individual firms, it is less the individual firm that matters than it is the emergence of oligopolies selling interchangeable dominant designs.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.3/Firms-constructing-social-networks-as-Populations/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The developmental dynamics from entrepreneur to adaptive corporation are not enacted in isolation but within an ecology of other social organizations and networks. There are competitive corporations, customers, vendors, law firms, accounting firms, venture capital partnerships, commercial banks, investment banks, governments, standards-making bodies, universities, etc. The most important organizations or individuals to a firm are customers, customers that in this history are large corporations. Second in importance to customers are competitors. There are direct competitors, those selling essentially the same product, using the same or nearly the same technology, and indirect competitors, those selling products that can be used for the same purpose but achieve the functionality through different means. When a new technology makes possible new categories of products, there can be a surge of start-ups as well as existing firms all introducing products within a few years of each other. These firms, and others that join them later, interact competitively as a population of firms constructing a social network. If the firm interactions coalesce successfully, a new market will form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful new market will progress through three phases: “Emergence” to “Competitive” to “Order.” Emergence can last for many years and will consist of firms ranging from entrepreneurs attempting to form corporations to existing firms attempting to adapt into the new product category. What remains uncertain in the emergence phase is whether the products being commercialized hold enough economic potential to generate the sales to support successful firms. In the Competitive phase of market formation, the product category has proven to have traction but it remains unclear how large the market will be or how long it will last. It is during this phase that weaker or less successful firms begin being acquired or merge or fail completely. The last phase of market formation, Order, is when the often hundreds of firms that introduced products have shrunk to an oligopoly of as few as a half a dozen firms controlling two-thirds of the market. This history will observe Data Communications and Networking progressing through all three phases and Internetworking entering the Competitive phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This progression of market formation from emergence to competition to order will be metaphorically referred to as a wave. A wave, or sector, is distinct from other sectors largely by the nature of the new technology innovations. Sectors, also referred to as industries, can have niches, more refined distinctions, and sectors can, with time, merge with other sectors. Niches do not exist a priori but come into existence through the dynamics of markets and their ever=changing environments. Niches in time are absorbed into existing markets, disappear or, in the very rare instance, become markets themselves. Computer communications will be observed as three waves, or sectors (with co-evolving niches): Data Communications, Networking and Internetworking What is interesting is that hundreds of companies entered each wave, only a handful of firms came to dominate, and few firms ever impacted a successive sector. An intriguing mystery and one I hopefully have captured for your fun, and reflective mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three waves of computer communications were profoundly impacted by the changes occurring in the two technology sectors directly related to how computers would communicate with each other: computers and communications. The dynamics of the computer sector or market were dictated by free market competition, albeit the dominant firm, International Business Machines, controlled a near monopolistic market share. In contrast, American Telephone and Telegraph dominated the communication, or telecommunication, market as a regulated monopoly. The impact of each of these markets on computer communications will be briefly described. (A more complete reconstruction will be found in the text.) Interestingly, neither International Business Machines nor American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph became competitive factors in computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.4/Three-Revolutions-in-Computer-Technologies-and-Corporate-Usage-1968-1988/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1960s, corporate America began using computers in earnest. Executives, though intrigued by the cost savings and productivity gains promised by the manufacturers of computers, had often shied from the risks of implementation until International Business Machines (IBM) introduced its System/360 computer in 1965. Although not fully living up to its billings until roughly 1968, the System/360 changed corporate computing forever and marked the beginnings of the first revolution in computers: the Mainframe. The Mainframe revolution represents an example of corporate capitalism, not entrepreneurial capitalism. In 1969, the Mainframe market consisted of eight large firms: IBM and the Seven Dwarfs (General Electric, RCA, Burroughs, Control Data, Honeywell, National Cash Register, and Sperry Rand’s Univac division.) Two more computer revolutions – to be driven by entrepreneurial capitalism - await in the future: the Minicomputer and Personal Computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mainframe wave of computer usage suited the highly centralized corporations of the day. One big computer, the Host computer, sat in a raised-floor, air-conditioned, often high-security, room with terminals and printers and other peripherals directly wired to the Host computer in essentially a star configuration. The Host was the boss and every other device was a slave. This centralized architecture was perpetuated by the dominant firm in computers, IBM, and gave a great deal of power to their corporate clients, the Data Processing (DP) or Management Information System (MIS) departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first all the slave devices were local, but following the success of the IBM System/360, corporations wanted to locate terminals and printers at remote locations. To do so required sending the bits over the analog circuits of the telephone system. That drove the need for modems, the products that converted the bits to sounds and then back to bits. Modems and multiplexers - products that enable more than one computer device to share a telephone circuit - are the products of the first wave of computer communications: Data Communications. Modems and multiplexers were highly co-evolving technologies, yet only a handful of firms mastered both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s, the Minicomputer wave of computer usage blossomed. The minicomputer was originally introduced in 1965 when Digital Computer Corporation, a company financed by one of the earliest Boston venture capital firms, announced its PDP-8. Then in 1968, entrepreneurial capitalism took seed in the field of minicomputers and by 1972 ninety-two competitors had announced products. Corporations began employing minicomputers for two primary reasons: they were significantly less expensive than another mainframe, and application software became available commercially, making it possible to solve problems outside the corporate DP departments without having to wait the long, uncertain times for software to be created or changed on the Host computer(s). Soon personnel needed to access multiple computers. That meant having multiple terminals. But desktops were not large enough to accommodate multiple terminals, to say nothing of the hassle of using multiple terminals, or the extra wiring needing to be pulled through ceilings and walls. Products connecting one terminal to multiple computers were needed. This need drove the coming-into-being of the second wave of computer communications: Networking. Networking was engulfed quickly in competitive chaos with over two hundred firms offering competitive products. Our focus will be on products developed by the existing Data Communications firms - the data PBXs - and the products introduced by a flood of start-ups - local area networks (LANs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Personal Computer wave, the third wave of computer usage, surged through Networking like a tsunami. (The Personal Computer was really a powerful manifestation of the microcomputer revolution.) When networking first emerged, the need was to interconnect “dumb” computer terminals to multiple computers. The communication speeds were slow and the amount of data sent back and forth was modest. Personal computers would change those dynamics for they could transfer data at significantly higher interconnection speeds and the application software drove the needs for vast amounts of data. When IBM quickly developed and introduced its personal computer in August 1981, corporations went on a buying spree and within two years, more than twice as many personal computers were being bought as terminals. By 1988, it had become clear that the personal computer was giving rise to a new model of corporate computing, client server computing, with the mainframes and minicomputers functioning as data servers, in some sense as slaves, for the desktop personal computers. How the Networking firms focused on terminal interconnection adapted, or not, to the needs of personal computers will be another focus of this history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third wave of computer communications, Internetworking, emerged out of the conditions of networking. Corporations soon discovered they had proliferating numbers of networks: isolated islands of computers. Interconnecting their network islands into larger enterprise-wide networks became the next focus. Fortuitously, these corporations were in the midst of building their own voice communication networks, appropriating the switching and circuits they historically had acquired from the telephone companies. Adding data to these wide area networks (WANs) was relatively easy because the technology was digital. But controlling WANs using circuit switching was still not optimal and again the advantages of packet switching prevailed as more advanced networking routers were introduced to interconnect LANs over WANs. The emergence of Internetworking reflected the growing use of computers, and even more directly, the growing number of networks.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.5/Institutional-Change-in-Communications-Deregulation-and-Break-up-of-AT&T/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Returning again to 1968, American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;amp;T), a regulated monopoly of telecommunications, represented a gigantic roadblock to the emergence of data communications. AT&amp;amp;T management tightly controlled how the telephone network could be used and, in particular, believed data communications was irrelevant and thus focused on protecting its voice telephone network from foreign attachments But computer users and manufacturers saw the world differently and were frustrated with AT&amp;amp;T’s slowness in responding to their data needs. The Federal Communication Commission, the Federal agency responsible for regulating AT&amp;amp;T, hearing these complaints, initiated a public inquiry in 1967 to gather the facts necessary to inform public policy. In part their efforts would be upstaged by the settlement of the Carterfone antitrust suit in 1968 that mandated easy attachment of foreign devices to the AT&amp;amp;T system. Independent firms began selling modems and multiplexers and Data Communications was born. (Competition emerged in PBXs as well; PBXs, or private branch exchanges, were customer premises telephone switches. The FCC also liberalized the rules governing specialized common carriers and competition in long distance telecommunications began. Neither of these important developments are the focus of this history.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cracks in AT&amp;amp;T’s monopoly caused corporate managers to look even more intently at the rapidly growing computer market. But how could AT&amp;amp;T exist as both a regulated monopoly and a firm participating in markets decided by market competition? This problem persisted until January 1982 when AT&amp;amp;T consented to being broken-up, part of the company being free to compete where it wanted, specifically in the computer markets, and the balance to continue to serve the public as regulated monopolies. Although agreed to in January 1982, dismantling the largest corporation in the world would take time, so the formal legal separation was set for January 1, 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent to the break-up, AT&amp;amp;T management realized they needed to become more aggressive. Since digital designs and semiconductor technology was dramatically reducing the cost of providing circuits, they began lowering the price of high-bandwidth T-1 digital circuits. Large corporations seized the opportunity to build their own private voice networks with T-I multiplexers being sold by Data Communication firms and new start-ups. These predominantly voice wide-area networks (WANs) soon became the means for corporations to interconnect their LANs. Again led by new firms, competitors began selling routers to interconnect LANs over WANs and the sales of the Internetworking sector took off. AT&amp;amp;T would never be a competitive force in either Networking or Internetworking and even struggled to maintain a reasonable market share in Data Communications.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.6/A-Brief-Overview-of-Computer-Communications-1968-1988/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Now to briefly overview the three waves of computer communication from 1968-1988 with the names of the corporations playing prominent roles in this history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Communications emerged between 1967-1971 in response to the growth in use of mainframe computers and the desire for remote peripheral connections, regulatory changes, growth in the number of timesharing and service bureau firms, advances in semiconductor technology, availability of venture capital and a hot IPO market. Over one hundred firms announced modem or multiplexer products. In 1968, Codex Corporation introduced the world’s first 9600 bit per second modem and American Data Systems (to become Micom in the future), the first time-division multiplexer. Other competitors were: Milgo, Infotron, General DataComm, Timeplex, Paradyne, Vadic and Universal Data Systems. The Data Communication firms were shielded from new competition through most of the 1970’s when experts forecasted sales of modems and multiplexers to peak at an uninteresting $150 million. In 1980, sales of Data Communication products exceeded $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years before the emergence of Data Communications, however, computer scientists sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) proved the circuit-based telephone system woefully lacking for interconnecting computers. In essence, they demonstrated that the paradigm of communications inherent to the Data Communication firms, (i.e. computer communications using the circuit switching architecture of the telephone network), was inadequate for computer networks. In 1968, ARPA funded the Arpanet computer communications network. It was the first network designed for computers rather than for humans. The radical step was to build a message-based, not circuit-based, communications network. In 1972, a public demonstration of Arpanet proved to the world that a new paradigm, “packet switching,” worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even before the public demonstration ARPA scientists knew Arpanet would work and that the military would want to interconnect other types of networks, such as radio-based or satellite networks, to the Arpanet. But the Network Control Program networking protocol of Arpanet assumed that all computers existed on the Arpanet. How to interconnect networks became a nearly decade-long effort culminating in three important, highly similar, yet incompatible, public internetworking protocols: XNS, TCP/IP, and OSI. (Xerox Corporation developed XNS and made some of the protocol public. There were also other entirely proprietary protocols, e.g. IBM’s SNA, DEC’s DECNET, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1970s, the proof that packet switching worked also inspired the creation of many kinds of networks. Three networks targeted to the office and factory and evolved from packet switching will be of the most interest: Ethernet, token ring and token bus. At first, these local area networks (LANs) did not use the telephone network; they interconnected the computers in a building or campus using coaxial cable. This distinction would cause the Data Communication firms to ignore LANs until they either had to enter the market through acquisition or found it too late to adapt to this new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 1970s came to a close, the explosion in the use of minicomputers caused corporate buyers to seek products enabling single terminals to connect to multiple computers, or computers to other computers. In 1979, eager entrepreneurs launched three important LAN start-ups: 3Com, Ungermann-Bass and Sytek. 3Com and Ungermann-Bass elected to offer Ethernet products. Sytek chose to pursue broadband-based products. The two leading Data Communication firms, Codex and Micom, also encountered this growing customer requirement, and responded with products rooted in their multiplexer technologies, a circuit-switching model, rather than the packet-switching paradigm inherent in the leading LAN architectures. While data PBXs cost a lot less at first, they lacked the advantages of LANs. The competitive phase of Networking was particularly intense as over two hundred firms announced products. Other prominent firms to this history are: Interlan, Bridge Communications, Concord Data Systems, Proteon, Excelan and Communication Machinery Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, users, especially government agencies, anticipated the uncertainties surrounding LAN technologies and internetworking protocols. In the late 1970’s, a number of standards-making efforts were launched. The two that will be observed most closely are IEEE 802, to determine LAN standards, and ISO/OSI, to determine networking and internetworking protocols as well as LAN standards. IEEE 802 issued its Ethernet standard in 1983, and, in subsequent years, token bus and token ring standards. The OSI standards, especially those embracing LANs, took longer to negotiate. Vendors and customers gravitated to the only standard that was fully public, TCP/IP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the years standards were being negotiated, the battle for the Office of the Future contributed to the competitive chaos that engulfed Networking. Experts envisioned all information technologies one day being digital, and a time rapidly approaching when voice, data and video information would be carried on the same communication networks. The question became which black box would do the switching: the traditional PBX, the new digital PBXs, or LANs? Everyone had an opinion for no product as of then had shown it could handle all three data types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in August 1981, IBM introduced its personal computer. The Networking market would soon be changed forever. While it would take a few years for the profoundly different needs of personal computers and computer terminals to match general customer requirements, when they did, LAN sales soared and data PBX sales collapsed. Not all LAN firms saw the changes being wrought by the personal computer, or reacted quickly enough. Corporations went on a tear installing networks, increasingly personal computer networks, and by 1985, Networking sales totaled $1 billion, up from a mere $62 million in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1985-1986, corporations were creating not only LAN networks; they were building their own enterprise-wide voice networks, or wide area networks (WANs). WANs were made feasible by the dropping prices of high-capacity, digital T-1 circuits and newly available T-1 multiplexers. Once again new start-ups, such as Network Equipment Technologies, forced the action. Existing Data Communication firms, like Codex and Micom, struggled to respond. Before long, corporations wanted to transmit their LAN traffic over their WANs. A new breed of Internetworking firms, like cisco Systems and Wellfleet, emerged. The routers they developed introduced a new architecture and new operating systems designed for packet switching. Data Communication, and most of the Networking firms were caught flat-footed or were so consumed with other opportunities, or problems, they lost out on what would in time be the largest computer communication market: Internetworking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, two public demonstrations proved that computers from many vendors could function seamlessly as one large network. At the Enterprise Networking Event the OSI networking protocols were demonstrated and at Interop, TCP/IP. What happened to the firms of interest - Codex, Micom, 3Com, Ungermann-Bass, NET and Wellfleet - completes this history, that is, with a few surprises. (You probably can see some already.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer communications was essential to the growing use of computers, first by letting remote locations access Host computers, and then by giving users easy access to multiple computers, first locally on a network, and then through internetworking to any network anywhere. Enterprise-wide, global information systems could not exist without computer communications. The modern global Information Economy could not have emerged without computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This history attempts to reconstruct the sheer joy, never-ending struggles, glorious victories, disheartening failures, utter madness and inner workings of entrepreneurial capitalism. For the emergence of computer communications from 1968 to 1988 represents an example of entrepreneurial capitalism at its best: when visions were transformed into the infrastructure interconnecting the world’s computers. It is a history of numerous technological innovations becoming economic growth through firms selling products: products totaling $5 billion of sales in 1988. I hope you enjoy reading a small fraction of the riveting stories of the individuals, firms and organizations that made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.7/Personal-Comments/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Not being an educated historian, or a professional writer, I decided to organize this book around two concepts: excerpts from eighty interviews I would conduct and transcribe, and a hypertext format that would enable one to read the book in a way he or she found most interesting, and that might not be the time-stamp format I have imprinted on the material. I hope this book eventually becomes a high level index into the larger database this history rests upon: interviews; company information including business plans, IPO documents, financials, public information; market research, especially Dataquest, Datapro and Yankee Group; and trade and financial press reports. Every individual, corporation, social organization, and technology would then be a “link” into a larger set of data. Such an extension could also permit other individuals with the companies I write about, companies I do not mention, market researchers, academics, policy makers, anyone to add data, or views, and make for an even vastly richer explorations of this very important time in human history. A list of those interviewed is in Exhibit I.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by hypertext? I have subdivided this history into roughly two-page “hypertext” increments covering a specified timeframe and addressing an idea, an individual or a firm. These hypertext increments are then aggregated into chapters representing a larger time period for one or more sectors of computer communications: Data Communications, Networking, or Internetworking. Since the sector histories overlap in time, each chapter reconstructs one sector history for a certain number of years before the next chapter jumps back in time to bring another sector history roughly to the same year. This structure gives you the freedom to read the story of one firm, for instance, from beginning to end by selecting the appropriately labeled hypertext increments. Using Codex Corporation by way of example, three hypertext increments in Chapter 1 cover 1956-1968, four increments in Chapter 3 cover 1969-1972, four increments in Chapter 5 cover 1973-1978, and so on. In addition to each chapter being subdivided into hypertext increments, chapters begin with one-page Overviews and ending summaries labeled In Perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This historical reconstruction can also be read at any of five levels of observation: macro conditions, ideas or technology, individuals, firms, or populations of firms. The following table gives examples of some of the possible reads for each level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;LEVEL OF OBSERVATION&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;EXAMPLES OF POSSIBLE READS&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Macro Conditions&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Impact of Military spending&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Impact of digital technology&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Government regulation&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Corporate capital investment&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Ideas or Technology&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Packet Switching&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Ethernet&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Network Protocols&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;XNS&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;OSI&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Individuals&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Dr. J.C.R.

Nevertheless 1968 was the crucial year for a number of reasons, the most important being: the Carterfone Decision, funding of ARPANET, the introduction of the first 9600 bps modem and time-division multiplexer, the rush of minicomputer start-ups, a hot IPO market, and funding of Intel Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book ends in 1988 for two good reasons and one arbitrary reason. In 1988, the Enterprise Networking Event and Interop successfully demonstrated internetworking software. Computers from different vendors running different operating systems could share data over a wide variety of communication networks. What had been the goal for nearly two decades had been accomplished. The arbitrary reason is that I started interviewing people in 1988 and was interested in a history book, not a predictive book. I wanted those interviewed to know that I was only interested in the past. Most of the people I interviewed have a role in this history and all had a role in educating me how that history unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three decades have passed since those restless night when I tried to make sense of the dynamics of technological innovation, to now, unable to ever thank all the people who have helped me along the way to bring this project to a conclusion. Nevertheless, I would be doing many people a disservice if I did not mention them by name. First and foremost, heartfelt thanks to all those who made their time available in 1988 to sit with me and share memories still recent enough to be less guarded, or in the need of, the interpretive filters that success all too often invites. A few interviewees continued to be of help over the decades, and to them I shall be forever grateful: Paul Baran, John Day, Bruce Smith, Dan Lynch, and Art Carr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had the great fortune to become associated with the Santa Fe Institute, there were a number of scientists who were interested in the historical data I had collected and how it might inform their studies of technological innovation. I know that I gained much more than they did and I shall never forget the long conversations continuing into so many late summer evenings. While some of these individuals have left the study of innovation to others, David Lane, Walter Fontana, John Padgett, and Chuck Sable have unknowingly had a lasting impact on this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure I would not have persisted for as long as I did without the unwavering support and encouragement of Martin Shubik, Stuart Greenfield, Harold Shattuck, John Day, and Andy Russell. There is no way I can thank each of you enough for your friendship and help, other than to say, finally, here it is, an economic history of the first two decades of the “plumbing” of the global economy, reconstructed using the “voices of some of the key participants. For the reader, the voices can be experienced through the liberal use of excerpts in the text, or by reading the transcriptions, or, in the future, listening to the interviews. I hope I have honored each and every one of you, as well as all of you who I did not have the time or insight to interview, in this brief reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, are those individuals to whom this online book would not be possible without their sacrifice and help. First and foremost is Verona Fonte, who crafted my sketchy ideas into a website that, at the time, was thought impossibly hard to do. But Verona would not be discouraged, and even though it took her far afield of her own creative accomplishments, she willed herself through long hours and her indefatigable constitution to accomplish the impossible. She was a dear friend who I will always honor. Kyle Roth and Mike Connor whom never balked at whatever I asked of them and thus we have transcribed interviews –and much more– and I was able to retain some of my sanity. Marc Weber and Jennifer De La Cruz of the Computer History Museum provided help, enthusiasm and boosts of energy I sorely needed to bring this project to a conclusion. They will also be the guardians of all the primary research the CHM has graciously agreed to store and make available, and the on-line book the Museum will maintain for an indefinite future. Thank you. Edward Lau has my eternal gratitude for saying yes and coding the last chapter so that I can say it is finished. Finally, I have the joy of acknowledging the help Bob Stearns gave me whenever I called, without ever hesitating, and of thanking Dorothea Smith, whom I shall love forever, for gracing my life and always believing in me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I did not thank you, the reader, for sensing the importance of these events and people, and wanting to learn more of the history of how the vision of the giant of the evolution of the information revolution, J.C.R. Licklider, whose fantastic idea – the Intergalactic Computer Network – became a global communication network that has changed everyone’s idea of not only the future, but their futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Pelkey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 2013 Kula, HI&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/2.0/Terminology/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Computers represent the defining technologies of the Information Economy. By the turn of the century, life in modern society are unimaginable without the aid of computers, and yet in the early 1950’s, few people could imagine how more than a handful would ever be needed. To understand the emergence and dynamics of computer communications first requires an understanding of how computers evolved from 400 ton cabinets, or entire rooms full of tube racks, to desktop personal computers. For the explosive growth in the use of computers drove the need for computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the first electronic computer was powered up in late 1945, (or potentially the Colossus computer of 1939-1940) it was not because those involved saw a bright economic future for computers. Instead, it was because the military needed machines that could do faster calculations. Those designing ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) drew on core ideas then almost three hundred years old. Once reduced to practice, the ENIAC computer was quickly surpassed by newer and better versions. Even so, few believed they held value for business, and it was not until 1954 that a computer was sold to an organization other than the government. By the early 1960’s, over one hundred different computers had been designed and built to find the best design. Then in 1963, IBM announced the System/360. It became the “dominant design”,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  and businesses’ accelerating growth in the use of computers launched an explosion in computer revenues. By 1968, revenues exceeded $5 billion; and by 1988, $35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter will begin with a brief introduction of technology and its relationship to product. These ideas will surface throughout this work, and prove indispensible to understanding the relationships of technology and economic growth. Also to be introduced will be the concept of market-structures. Corporations innovating technologies in competition with each other coalesce into orderly patterns of co-evolution. These patterns will be observed as market-structures. The history of computers will then be reconstructed using these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology--market-structures&quot;&gt;Technology &amp;amp; Market Structures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern of growth and change of a technology from an idea, to first product, to dominant design, to rapid growth is not unusual, but the norm. The pattern represents a particular “trajectory.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  Such a trajectory tracks the changes in a technology’s performance over time; where the definition of performance can vary (See Diagram 1.0 Technology Trajectory). Trajectories can assume virtually any pattern. Successful trajectories, however, generally resemble an “S-curve,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and can be thought to represent the cumulative learning curves&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  of all firms innovating the technology. In the discussion to follow, trajectory implies a range of possible futures with the S-curve the normative case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-a-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram 1.0 Technology Trajectory&quot; title=&quot;Diagram 1.0 Technology Trajectory&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful technologies will be thought to progress through five distinct stages. The concept of stages is expository only, and carries no implication of pre-determination. As will become clear, patterns of technological change, and development, are a consequence of many factors, of which the intrinsic “superiority” of the technology is but one factor, often not the most important one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stage begins with an Idea. Since ideas originate with people, a person, or persons, initiates each technology and thus trajectory; for the technologies of interest herein, the people are invariably members of an organizations. Most ideas remain undeveloped, sometimes for centuries. The idea of computers, for example, dates to the 17th century. If an idea holds sufficient potential, incentive may exist to transform the idea into product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is product that converts technology into an economic good. Consequently, the first time a product embodying a new technology is created begins the second stage of a technology trajectory. This stage will be called Product Instantiation (See Diagram 1.1 Stages of a Technology Trajectory). Almost without fail, an organization, or organizations, will be involved. In the case of computers it was the University of Pennsylvania. Organizations are the economic entities that invest the capital needed to finance all the tasks necessary to transform idea into product. Investment is key. Investment need not be motivated by financial gain — U.S. Government investment advancing computing technologies during World War II, for example, was motivated by national security. Regardless of the reason, investment, risk capital, funds the transformation of idea into product by organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a product exists it must then stand the test of value. If valuable, and if the technologies hold the potential to be improved, then there may be justification – investment logic – to create another, improved version of the product. The newer product benefits from what was learned during prior creation as well as use. The second computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Calculator), differed from ENIAC in that it did not have to be rewired for every new use but used encoded instructions – a significant improvement, and one central to the advancement of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a technology, and its embodiment as product, beomes recognized as economically attractive, other organizations will begin innovating&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  it. Initially, each organization will pursue unique innovation strategies to gain competitive advantage – innovating in ways they believe best responds to market demand. Once multiple organizations begin innovating products in competition with each other, their combined actions drive the technology trajectory into a new stage, to be called Competitive Products .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-a-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram 1.1 Stages of a Technology Trajectory&quot; title=&quot;Diagram 1.1 Stages of a Technology Trajectory&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms will continue to pursue their own strategies of exploration and exploitation&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  until a dominant design has emerged. In exploring, each firm continues to search for the most competitive product, whereas once it believes it has found such a product, it attempts to exploit that product optimally. When the dominant design emerges, those products not conforming to it, begin to fade in importance. Those firms that can, switch their innovation strategy to be in concert with the dominant design. How one product, or design, achieves dominance is highly “path dependent,” with being best, however defined, just one factor.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  Users buying the product – to be labeled broadly as “buying demand” – are the ultimate test. The coming into being of a dominant design signifies that the technology trajectory has evolved from the Competitive Product to the Dominant Design stage. Once the dominant design has emerged, successful firms will produce increasingly interchangeable product, although firms can add differentiation in many other ways. Much more will be said about dominant designs in future chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the dominant design is robust, that is it can adapt to future requirements without destroying the competencies of the successful firms, then the trajectory might last for a long time, and become sustainable. Sustainability is the last stage of a technology trajectory. Finding technologies that lead to sustainable products while generating meaningful economic growth is essential to both firms and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product, the economic good or artifact, and the object of economic exchange, can be conceptualized as a “black box.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  First, imagine a black box – you can see what it looks like but you can’t know what is inside it. As a consequence, you haven’t any idea what to use it for. Once instructed in its use, you are then faced with a choice. You can either decide to change your behavior and make use of the black box, or not. You hold the perspective of the user. Economically, a most important condition is financial gain from using the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950’s, using computers to calculate solutions to complicated and complex problems was thought to take “forever.” The military, however, needed computers fast enough to make possible an air defense system as protection against and deterrent to the Russians. They wanted computers to perform in “real-time.” They were concerned with use, others had to design and manufacture the computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those others view the black box from the inside. They hold the perspective of the designers and builders. For them, the world is much more complicated. They must care how it is used, for if it is not used, it will not be successful, and if it is not successful there is no reason to make it. (To the individuals that means no income, i.e. job; to the firm, no profits, no cash, no existence.) Designers and builders must also master what is necessary to design and create the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In creating product, designers and builders can change either the product’s “architecture”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  or the “components” with which it is built. The architecture is the product’s design – how the components are assembled to produce function. Different architectures can lead to profoundly different products, so different in fact, that even products using common components function differently. For example, early computers, television sets and radios all shared the common component of the vacuum tube – yet in each product, the vacuum tube served different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an architecture becomes sufficiently unique, it defines a new “paradigm.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; A paradigm includes the knowledge, problems, procedures, tasks&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  and experience required to master the architecture. Paradigms will be discussed more fully later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in existence, successful product will justify the innovation of new, improved versions. Designers now have different architecture and component choices. Choice has been created by the passage of time, prior experience, customer requirements, organzation capabilities, funding, availability of new architectures, new components, and so on. Most often, the choices lead to “incremental”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;  improvement of the prior product. If significant, product advances can be viewed as leaps, or step-like improvements, measured in generations. Computers, televisions, and radios have all changed over time based on the innovation of successive generations of newer and better versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New paradigms often cause a “ technological discontinuity.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;  If so, the new product is not the next generation of a prior product, but a product of entirely new characteristics that make it distinct, or “ radical”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;  – the computer from the television set. In the following history of computers, three computer paradigms will emerge: mainframe computers, minicomputers and personal computers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the integrated circuit led to incremental innovation in mainframe computers, the IBM System/360 architecture, and concurrently, radical innovation as minicomputers. A decade later, microprocessors led to incremental innovation in minicomputers, and to some extent mainframe computers, and radical innovation as the personal computer. By 1988, the combined revenues of these three computer market-structures soared seven-fold in just twenty years, to $35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these terms, this chapter can be summarized as a story of how computers changed over time in response to three technological discontinuities – those caused by the transistor, integrated circuit and microprocessor. During this same period, users’ requirements, or buying demand, were also changing – from batch processing; to real-time computing; to real-time, on-line computing; and finally to personal distributed computing. These new user requirements, when architected into products using the newest component innovations, gave rise to two new computer paradigms – minicomputers and personal computers. By 1988, these three computer paradigms were co-evolving, and were instantiated as economic entities in firms and economic objects as products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which raises the last interpretive concept needed for this chapter – “ market-structures. “ Firms that innovate and sell products in competition with each other constitute both markets and industries. Markets and industries are neither synonymous nor do they exist independent of each other. A market is a process, a dynamic, a game of economic exchange enacted by economic agents – in the case of computer communications, by firms. Like all games, markets function according to rules. Some rules are very general, such as those governing private property, contracts, and commerce. Others are market specific, such as regulations and antitrust constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms innovate technologies to create economic objects, products, that are exchanged, thus giving rise to markets. The success and failure of all firms’ actions constitute industry structure – the ordering of the economic agents with respect to each other. One form of industry order classifies an industry as a monopoly, oligopoly, or competitive. In a monopoly, order resides as one firm; in an oligopoly, a few firms dominate; and in a competitive industry, all or most firms are capable of influencing market futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market and industry constantly define and refine one another’s existence and potential via the actions of all firms. Market as process and industry as structure with processes acting on structures that condition future processes, and so on. This mutual co-evolution of a market and industry will be called a market-structure.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;  (See Diagram 1.2 Market-structure) Market-structures become constructed from the actions of firms, and do not exist a priori, simply waiting for firms to discover them. Equally, firms can be members of many market-structures, in some marekt-structures they are vitally important to collective outcomes, in others they are strictly peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-structures are the firm and product instantiations of technology paradigms. Every paradigm gives rise to a new market-structure. The three computer paradigms central to this history will be observed as three distinct, yet co-evolving market-structures. More will be said about the dynamics of market-structures in future chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-a-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram 1.2 Market-structure&quot; title=&quot;Diagram 1.2 Market-structure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, contrasting computers and communications, the telecommunications market-structure in 1968 was a regulated monopoly – only American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;amp;T) could provide telecommunications products and services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;  But by 1988, telecommunications also consisted of multiple market-structures, each of which had unique market processes and industry structures. The transformation of the regulated telecommunications market into a competitive one is told in the next Chapter – Changing Rules of Competition. But first, a history of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;telecommunications&quot;&gt;Telecommunications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accelerating use of computers by organizations in the mid-1960’s looked like it might run aground on the restrictive policies and practices of American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;amp;T), the regulated monopoly of telecommunications. In sharp contrast to the turbulent, market-structuring dynamics of computers, where innovation knew no bounds, telecommunications had become ingrown, with AT&amp;amp;T aggressively resisting new uses of the telephone network, even those made possible with products it had innovated. For twenty years, AT&amp;amp;T fought to preserve the institutional arrangements that protected it from the uncertainties of market competition. Then in two landmark rulings by the Federal Communication Commision (FCC), Carterfone (1968) and MCI (1969), competition with AT&amp;amp;T was made possible. By 1983, the war of ideas and technologies had been won, and on January 1, 1984, AT&amp;amp;T, the largest corporation in the world, reorganized into eight new corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case of AT&amp;amp;T shows that market economies do not just happen, but require intentional action. When the Founding Fathers framed the U.S. Constitution, they intentionally strengthened safeguards for private property, believing private property an innate right of man, and when protected by law, private economic behavior promoting the public good would result. Corporations, however, factored little into their deliberations, both because they lived in an agrarian society, and because corporations were equated with the detested monopolies of Britain. But with time, it became apparent that society needed to incentivize collective actions to accomplish what government was neither authorized to do nor capable of doing. Corporations, therefore, became important to the evolving economy, and so both the national and state governments enacted rules to incentivize their creation and use. Over time other new rules were needed to foster economic behavior, rules enforced by institutions, such as those which would later regulate AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief introduction of institutions will be followed by an overview of the history of the institutions of American capitalism up to the 1870’s. When AT&amp;amp;T was founded in 1873,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;  the prevailing industrial conditions were known as competitive capitalism. Industrial firms were small, state constrained, and owner-managed. Not one public industrial corporation existed. Competitive capitalism proved only transitional however. For in 1832, the vision of a entrepreneur gave birth to the telegraph that unleashed the Information Revolution. The story of the subsequent crisis of competitive capitalism and the rise of corporate capitalism will be told next – for by World War I, corporate capitalism had overwhelmed competitive capitalism, and the economy was soon dominated by oligopolies of large public companies. During those revolutionary times, 1880 to 1914, AT&amp;amp;T and telecommunications assumed forms that would last until the assault of computers began in the mid-1960’s. That story will constitute most of this chapter. The focus of the reconstruction beginning in the mid-1960’s will be of how users won the rights to attach and interconnect equipment of their own choice to the telephone system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;institutions&quot;&gt;Institutions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutions,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;  like market-structures, order interactions among corporations. The two function very differently however. Market-structures represent order emerging from the interactions of corporations – order that can neither be guaranteed to emerge nor to persist. Institutions, on the other hand, enforce order on corporations by making them conform to rules. Being able to impose rule-based behavior is important, for frequently, economic consequences are thought better decided by reason, or the political process, than left simply to the chance of market dynamics. The most common source of institutional authority is government, which derives its authority from sovereign law – the Constitution in the case of the United States. Certain institutions are essential to the emergence of market economies – private property, contracts, money, law, and corporations for example. Other institutions are market-structure specific, and can change both frequently and dramatically. Corporations, the defining economic agents of a modern economy, exist as members of many market-structures and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutions are not only fundamental to economies, but to the very essence of how we, humans, interact with each other. Choices and actions we make today are based on our confidence in knowing what conditions will prevail in the future. An example is driving a car. If we were not certain that other drivers would always drive on the “right” side of the road, obey stop lights, and, in other ways we have come to know and behave predictably, then we would be foolish to risk our lives driving. Driving can only exist if there are rules and constraints making certain everyone’s behavior. These rules and constraints, along with the means for their enforcement, such as licensing rules and the police, enable the institution of driving. Driving is obviously more than just an institution, as it is best if everyone is a competent driver, but without the underlying institutions, people would not drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving can also be likened to market behavior, with order emerging when people drive cars at high speeds, in traffic, safely, and are able to get from where they are to wherever they want to go with confidence. Since it is impossible to specify exactly what every driver must do, all of the time, institutions can not fully specify driving behavior. Some decisions must be left to the individual drivers, competing and cooperating with all the other drivers who are on the road at the same time. Driving is influenced by both institutions – driving on the right side of the road, stopping where directed, and so on – and the emergence of regularities among the interactions of the individual drivers, such as the fastest cars using the far left lane, or what routes commuters take to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic institutions are created to order interactions of survival and material existence. In a modern economy, institutions are needed to order interactions among collectives, for it is through social organizations, collectives, that man meets his survival and material needs. A collective is any group of persons – or social organizations – whose individual members give up rights and freedoms in return for desired or required collective behavior. Willingness can be either voluntary, as in cooperative behavior, or coerced, in which a credible means of enforcement exists.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;  Either way, institutions make future collective interactions more certain. (If an “ideal” behavior exists, it can be additionally incentivized, such as lower car insurance premiums for accident free driving.) And since desired collective behavior changes over time, either intentionally or not, institutions must also change to maintain their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic institutions consist of three structural elements – rules, a means of enforcement and informal constraints – and the members constituting the collective.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Rules define those collective interactions allowed and those not. To have force, the rules must be attended with a credible means of enforcement. And since rules can never fully define every possible interaction, under every set of conditions, members of the collective must make choices and take actions&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; they believe consistent with institutional intent. Over time, regularities that arise from member interactions can assume almost rule-like authority, and come to exist as informal constraints – often becoming more important than the formal rules themselves. Examples of informal constraints are: norms, codes of conduct and conventions. Rules will be seen essential to the development of capitalism in the United States; as they are essential to all forms of organized societies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quintessential economic institution of a capitalist economy is private property – private property meaning the right to hold perpetual title of ownership of assets and their improvements, and the right to defend those rights before the law.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;  The rules of law define the rights of private property, and the courts are the means of enforcement. Consequently, private property requires a government credible enough to enforce the laws, yet not so strong as to abuse them. Governments create and protect private property in the belief that it is an appropriate way to incent private behavior to promote the “public good.” Consequently, there exists a dynamic between the public’s perception of the value of the benefits received from such an institution, and its continued willingness to support government policies needed to credibly and consistently enforce private property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private property began as a right enjoyed only by individual “natural persons” – people. When people had need to act as collectives, especially groups whose memberships changed over time, the constraint of natural person-based private property rights became a problem. Collectives needed the right to hold perpetual title to private property, even if their memberships changed. One solution to emerge was the corporation. From initial use over five hundred years ago&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;  to the end of the twentieth century, corporations have become a principal fixture of modern life, and the central economic agents in capitalist economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalist economies also require institutions that promote and protect the exchange of private property – commerce – and the agreements economic agents make between each other – contracts. These three fundamental institutions of capitalism – commerce, contracts and corporations – will be examined historically beginning with the adoption of the U. S. Constitution. Their genesis, while dating to Europe, can be thought to begin with the Constitution for it was only then that they began evolving their modern forms. An example of these institutions in their early development, when America was still a British colony, follows.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts colony began in 1635 as a corporation chartered by the King of England. The King had innovated corporations to incent private actions thought to be in the crown’s best interests, in this case, people organized to settle America. With time, it became important for the Massachusetts colonial government to promote western migration. So it too resorted to the use of corporations. To incentivize a group of people to brave the hardships and risks of frontier settlement, and establish a permanent community, the colonial governments offered to convert settled land, and any improvements made thereon, to private property in the collective’s – township – name. Each township, once it held title, could then decide how to sub-divide property rights among individual members. At first, every collective held some land back, undivided – the “commons”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;  – with which it could attract others to their community. But with time, a problem arose. Many of the early settlers wanted to move West, and increasing numbers of new settlers were moving into existing communities. How then were the commons to be divided?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1713, the colony of Massachusettsenacted a statute authorizing “town proprietors and their heirs to organize as an economic body separate from the town government and exercise corporate control over the division of undivided land.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; Private property rights had been separated from natural and civil rights – private property rights making once public goods no longer “equally” shared by everyone.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; In this example, the township existed as a corporation under contract from the colonial government with the authority to contractually vest private property rights with individuals who could subsequently exchange those rights through commerce.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1787, just six years after the United States won its independence, fifty-five men of property convened and rewrote the nation’s constitutional rules. In doing so, they jump started a struggling economy down the path to industrial capitalism. It would take nearly one hundred years. But by the 1870’s, state-based economies of small, private, owner-managed corporations, or competitive capitalism, prevailed. No sooner had competitive capitalism emerged, then it became mired in crisis. The United States was not alone. From 1873 to 1896, the Great Depression engulfed the world economy. Then, in the incredibly brief span of five years, 1898 to 1903, a revolution transformed the industrial economy of the United States, and corporate capitalism emerged to overwhelm competitive capitalism. By World War I, large, public corporations competing as members of oligopolies dominated industrial America – competition becoming oligopolies, the same pattern as observed in the history of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a brief look at these three historical phases of American industrial capitalism – competitive capitalism, crisis, and corporate capitalism. They in turn constitute the larger background to the innovation of the telephone (1873 - 1877), and the formation of American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph, the corporation that will come to dominate telecommunications as a regulated monopoly until 1984. That story follows.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/2.2/The-Institutions-of-Competitive-Capitalism/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The United States began independent life as a confederacy – an organization formed by strong sovereign member states and weak central, or national, powers – operating under the sovereign law, or rules, set forth in the Articles of Confederation that were ratified in 1781. From the start, the confederacy proved incapable of solving a number of problems. First, the Europeans’ divisive economic tactics were confounding the emergence of a domestic economy. Second, the individual states were abusing private property rights, stifling economic incentive. Third, the weak national government, without means to raise moneys of its own, proved impotent in solving any of the substantive issues facing the new nation, such as what to do about the continental debt, settlement of western lands, interstate commercial disputes, or needed financial infrastructure. Fourth, the United States was caught up in a world economy confronting the limitations of mercantilism. The rules of the Articles of Confederation were not proving effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic considerations were central to our Founding Fathers’ search for new sovereign laws to replace the Articles of Confederation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; In 1786, those with property,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; despairing for their own futures and the future of their young country, convened in Annapolis, Maryland to discuss their shared fate. One action called for a convention to be held the following spring to redraft the nation’s constitutional law. Congress seconded the call. The Constitutional Convention held from May to September 1787 stands special in human history. The fifty-five delegates conceived, not without disagreement and compromise, new “rules of law” that would give rise to the world’s most successful democracy and economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guiding the economic thinking of the Founding Fathers was a new voice, one that spoke out against the principles embedded in the hated mercantilism, the reigning economic ideology. Adam Smith ignited a revolution in economics with his Wealth of Nations, published the same year as the Declaration of Independence, 1776. Smith’s ideas appealed to the young Americans for many reasons, including the fact that he loudly and publicly condemned the colonization policies of Britain towards America. He considered the discovery of America to be one of the two most important events in history:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To prohibit a great people….from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also opposed government meddling in markets, and the granting of privileges and immunities to mercantilist monopolies, two issues over which the former colonists had waged war. In railing against the “sophistry,” “vulgar prejudices,” and “giddy ambition” of the mercantilist monopolists, Smith asserted the monopolists had to be resisted “to prevent the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Criticizing the philosophy of equating a nation’s interests with those of only the propertied class – the privileged under mercantilism – he claimed no nation would be successful, if most of its people were “poor and miserable.” His call resonated with those having recently shed the yokes of political and economic suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercantilism saw the world as having a limited amount of wealth. For a country to increase its wealth, which essentially meant its store of gold, it either had to have producing gold mines, or earn gold in trade satisfying “the demand of strangers.” Thus, societies were pitted against each other in competition, with one gaining only “at the expense of other societies.” The goal was “to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value,” and to produce those “things which now we fetch from strangers to our great impoverishing.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith’s vision was different. He viewed wealth not as a store of gold but as a “flow of goods.” It was a vision of creating wealth, not simply its transfer. His solution to creating wealth was to get out of the way of man’s drive to better himself and his natural propensity “to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; This “natural liberty,” if unimpeded by governments and their creations, monopolies, would give rise to a system of perfect market competition. All that was required was “peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; Smith wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way, and to bring both his industry and his capital into competition with those of any other man, or order of men.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith argued market competition would drive market prices to their natural prices – “the price of free competition.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; As every man pursued his own self-interests, the good of the whole would be advanced – hence the famous dictum: the “invisible hand.” Smith’s vision must have seemed like home-spun, fireplace logic to the Founding Fathers, who were self-made men very much in keeping with the industrious individualism of Smith’s economics. “Laissez-faire” economics, although Smith never used that term to describe his views, captured the sentiments of the majority of those convened to write the Constitution – “private interest is a better patron of commerce and plenty, than the refinements of state.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While providing market competition as an alternative to government meddling and dominating monopolies, Smith’s views remained very much rooted in an agricultural economy, one of individual farmers – despite the industrial revolution happening all around him.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; To Smith, capital productivity came first and foremost from agriculture. Regardless, his philosophy became the needed justification of emerging capitalists who sought a logic to defend their desire to be left to their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith’s ideas appealed to both sides of the American political debate, the Federalists and Republicans,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; for each could read into Smith’s ideas their own beliefs. To the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, Smith’s confidence in the individual, and the productive potential flowing from natural liberty, were exactly why they believed in the importance of protecting private property. The Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, saw in Smith’s arguments for small government reasons why the national government should be kept weak and powerless – and also why the threat of monopolies was best controlled locally, by the states. By providing a new theory of economic growth – market competition – to replace the tired and confining ideas of mercantilism, Smith had given the Constitutional Convention delegates the reasoning needed to keep government as removed from economic rule-making as possible. Protect private property and let it be freely exchanged. Then let experience provide the content needed for rules to have meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Constitution discarded the confederate form of government in favor of Federalism – government with multiple levels, each independent, yet mutually dependent, and with each level’s restrictions self-enforcing, so one level can not overpower another&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; – the famous checks and balances and multiple levels of government. The Constitution granted specific powers, or authority, to the Federal government, placed certain restrictions on the authority of the states, and all else was presumed to be either the right of the states or the people. Implicit in the design of this new sovereign law was an effort to keep government from ever becoming too powerful, or from the majority ever being able to trammel the rights of the minority – both abuses feared by private property owners who constituted a minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the many points of contact between the agent of the polity, government, and the working of the economy spelled out in the Constitution – taxes, tariffs, duties, intellectual property, private property, etc. – two clauses, or rules – commerce and contracts – proved essential to industrial capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commerce represents the buying and selling among economic agents, along with the governing rules, that constitute a market. The commerce clause gave the Federal government a new source of authority with respect to the states. Authority was needed to end economic conflict between the states. Its brevity belies its economic potential:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Section 8. The Congress shall have Power….To regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contracts are binding agreements that evidence exchange between economic agents engaged in commerce. The contracts clause differed from the commerce clause in an important way. It was not the source of a new power, but a restriction on existing state powers. (History will prove the contracts clause essential in protecting private property rights from state abuses,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; yet it almost did not make it into the Constitution, and was inserted at the very last moment after having been earlier rejected.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; ) Contract rights were critical for contracts evidenced title to private property and permitted its transfer. Again, the even briefer contract clause reads:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Section 10. No State shall..pass any…Law impairing the Obligations of Contracts,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their succinctness, these two clauses leave vast opportunities for alternative interpretations: What do words like regulate, commerce, impair, obligation, and contract mean?, and How are they to be operationalized? With multiple interpretations also came alternative implementations and means of enforcement, choices which gave definition and meaning to American capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution was silent on the issue of corporations, leaving their creation and control up to the states. The primary means of state control was in the granting of charters that specified the “privileges and immunities” to be enjoyed by the corporations. The corporation charter defines the governance structure of corporations much as the Constitution defines the governance structure of the nation. (See Diagram 2.0 Institutions of Capitalism) Only rather than being a contract between the people and government, it is one between government and a private institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Constitution was ratified by the needed nine states in the fall of 1788, elections were held, and the new government took office in early 1789. Among early acts were to levy tariffs on imports, pass the Judiciary Act of 1789 (to become as if part of the Constitution&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; ), and enact the Bill of Rights with its ten Amendments; ratification by the states took until December 1791. One clause in Amendment V of the Bill of Rights will prove especially important to the institutions of industrial capitalism:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No person shall be…deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1790’s proved to be a period for building financial infrastructure, including the institutions and organizations of money and banking, needed to effect market exchange.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; (The certificate of ownership in the first Bank of the United States – “scrip” – was first sold in early 1791 to raise $10 million. It soared in price from $25 to $300&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of months. Scrip was money created by the Bank of the United States.) The architect of these institutions and changes was Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of Treasury. He also issued a Report of Manufactures on December 5, 1791. Hamilton, felt strongly that a successful economy required domestic manufacturing;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; he had helped found the Associates of New Jersey Company earlier that spring, with a charter to “foster useful manufactures, deepen harbors, cut canals…”.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; His Report recommended a number of measures to promote domestic manufacturing, essentially nonexistent at the time,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; but Congress did not share Hamilton’s concern, and did nothing. The economy remained firmly agrarian with agricultural surplus exported and industrial goods imported.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-20-institutions-of-capitalism&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.0 Institutions of Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.0 Institutions of Capitalism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing may not have seemed important, but the same could not be said for state-based, internal infrastructure projects. In the 1790’s, the states began authorizing grants of privileges and immunities of corporations to create public projects for which the states had neither the moneys, nor competencies and abilities to effect – especially transportation projects, such as inland navigation, turnpikes, toll roads, and canals. These projects all required collective behavior, and to provide incentive for such actions, state legislatures created corporations, as only the law could do. They were known as “special-action franchises.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; Depending on the terms of the negotiated charter, one important incentive was the creation of private property to appeal to the self-interests of the people needed to effect collective action. From 1780 to 1801, the states chartered 317 corporations, nearly two-thirds for transportation projects, i.e. infrastructure, 20 percent banks and insurance companies, ten percent local public services (primaily water supply), and less than 4 percent industrial corporations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1800, in a tied election decided by the House of Representatives, Thomas Jefferson, a Republican, became President. The out-going Federalist President, John Adams, among his last acts in office packed the Federal courts with Federalists, including John Marshall, then Secretary of State, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Federalist controlled, lame-duck Congress conspired as well, passing legislation strengthening the Judiciary. The Republicans were furious. Jefferson began impeaching the most partisan judicial appointees, and Congress repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801. But the Federalists proved equal to the fight. At least John Marshall, who “hated Jefferson,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; did. Marshall would become a dominant figure influencing the emergence of capitalism. His self-education reinforced his native beliefs in the principles of hard work and private property, and much like Hamilton, he strived to strengthen private property rights every opportunity possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Marshall saw among his first tasks to strengthen the authority of the Court to interpret and enforce both Constitutional and enacted law; Marshall believed a strong Court could protect and extend property rights. Only he also knew Jefferson stood philosophically against a strong Court. How then to steer a course to a strengthened Court without causing a Constitutional crisis was his challenge. The vehicle was handed to him almost immediately when a Federalist-appointed judge the Republicans refused to seat filed a suit to secure his appointment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; The case was Marbury v. Madison (1803) – one of the most significant cases in judicial history. In an act of “judicial statesmanship,” Marshall, in writing the opinion, gave Jefferson the court victory – the Judge was not seated – but in the process established forever the power of judicial review. Institutionally, the Supreme Court had seized the authority to enforce constitutional law, power never formally granted to it by law.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; Its implications prove profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the nineteenth century, the courts began taking a more active role in commercial disputes. Until then, the courts referred “merchant” disputes to law merchant courts administered by other merchants, rather than by professional lawyers or judges – a form of self-regulation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; In 1801, the New York State Supreme Court opined that it would no longer refer cases involving questions of law to mercantile arbitration. Then in 1807, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that a private corporation could not coerce its members; in essence ruling that private corporations had to have internal contracts if they were to have the power and legal authority to enforce rules and settle disputes – contracts coming under the authority of the law. The reach of the court moved ever more assuredly into the commercial world.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1805, the lack of domestic manufacturing became a crisis. Britain and France decreed new rules for international shipping, rules meant to severely limit what American frigates could carry. They took away a lucrative source of profits for the Americans, confiscated as many violating ships as they could, and asserted monopoly trading rights and profit-taking. In response, Jefferson, trying to end these decrees without going to war, ordered an embargo on all American trade with Britain and France. Only how were Americans to get the industrial goods they were becoming accustomed to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York State was among the first states to act, creating the School Fund in 1805 to incent local entrepreneurs to manufacture, or mine, essential industrial goods – such as textiles, glassware, paper making, iron implements, slate mining and evaporation of salt from brine.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt; The School Fund was endowed with an initial grant of 500,000 acres of land,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; with the proceeds from their sale to be loaned to industrial entrepreneurs as three year notes, bearing six percent interest, and secured by borrower mortgages. Interest earned was to be distributed to the common school districts of the state. The School Fund represented government acting as venture capitalist to incentivize entrepreneurial activity, with the intent to invest, as guardian of the public good, in education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1810, the Supreme Court ruled in Fletcher v Peck that state made, or signed, contracts carried the protection of the Constitution.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; Once created, the state could not take them away. Described as “a corner-stone of legal structure laid in mud”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt; by one highly informed critic, it was an imaginative extension of the meaning of contract – contract rights preceded positive, man-made law, and were protected by natural law, and consequently a vested right&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt; – an argument first credited to Hamilton, and an important extension of Federal authority over the states.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt; Marshall wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It may well be doubted whether the nature of society and of government does not prescribe some limits to the legislative power; and, if any be prescribed, where are they to be found, if the property of an individual, fairly and honestly acquired, may be seized without compensation?”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The period from 1816 to 1824 was known as the “Era of Good Feelings.” A growing population, coupled with the resolved institutions of world trade as a consequence of the War of 1812, gave new energy to the emerging institutions of American commerce – the once all-purpose merchants, remnants of mercantilism, began giving way to specialized middlemen, for example.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt; However, the economy remained predominantly agrarian. In 1820, crude materials, such as cotton and wheat, represented 60% of exports, while finished manufactures were 57% of imports.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt; As would be expected, the population lived in the country, out of 9.6 million people, less than 5% lived in “places” of more than 8,000 inhabitants. Industrial manufacturing, other than that of textiles in the northeastern states – Lowell, Massachusetts for example – existed as home production, with factories, the production units of capitalism, a feature of the future. For now, people worked where they lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population growth and the abundance of natural resources were fundamental forces driving economic growth. Population growth also brought urbanization, which forced new forms of productive life, such as factory production, which will sow the seeds and become transformed into mass production. (See Exhibit 2.0 Population and Land Statistics 1790-1920)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before factory production could emerge, two institutional changes were needed: corporations had to have Constitutional protection, and the freedom to conduct interstate business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 1819, it was unclear if the states had police powers rights to void contracts they had made. If they could legally rescind prior grants of incorporation, they could take away a corporation’s assets. Wasprivate property held in corporate name protected under the Constitution? Since the word corporation appears nowhere in the Constitution, the answer was uncertain. Again enter the Supreme Court with Dartmouth College v Woodward (1819).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; In an epic decision, state-granted charters were ruled to be contracts, and thus could not be impaired by subsequent state act. Corporations did come under Constitutional protection. Even though the Court decision concerned a charter granted by the King of England, long before the Constitution ever existed, and concerned an educational organization, it was understood to apply to state granted corporation charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-21-population-and-land-statistics-1790-1920&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.1 Population and Land Statistics 1790-1920&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Census&lt;br /&gt; Date&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Population&lt;br /&gt; (in millions)&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Land Area&lt;br /&gt; (millions of&lt;br /&gt; square miles)&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Persons per&lt;br /&gt; Square Mile&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Population in&lt;br /&gt; Places of 8,000 &lt;br /&gt;Inhabitants or More&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Annual&lt;br /&gt; Population&lt;br /&gt; Growth Rate&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1790&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;0.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;4.5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.30&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1800&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;5.30&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;0.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;6.1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;4.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1810&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;7.20&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;4.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;4.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1820&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;9.60&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;5.5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;4.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;33%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1830&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;12.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;7.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;6.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;34%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1840&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;17.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;9.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;8.50&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;32%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1850&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;23.20&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;7.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;12.50&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1860&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;31.40&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;10.6&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;16.10&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;35%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1870&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;39.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;13.4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;20.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;27%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1880&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;50.20&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;16.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;22.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;26%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1890&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;62.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;21.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;29.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1900&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;76.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;25.6&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;32.90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1910&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;92.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;30.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;38.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1920&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;105.70&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;35.5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;43.80&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;source-of-data-business-annals-by-national-bureau-of-economic-research-inc-1926&quot;&gt;Source of Data: Business Annals by National Bureau of Economic Research Inc. 1926&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of Dartmouth College, corporation rights under state charters became more certain, and thus their use began to increase.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt; Even so, the states still very much controlled what rights corporations had, and, by simply inserting in the charter that the state reserved the right to change charter terms at any time, they could effectively circumvent Dartmouth College. Examples of how states maintained control in charter grants were: what businesses the corporation could engage in, how long it was authorized to exist, how much money it could raise (capitalization), the price per share of its stock (par value), how much debt it could have, how management decisions were made, whether it was tax-exempt or not, and whether it had rights of eminent domain or monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the tight control states exercised over corporation charters, two other disincentives discouraged corporation use: corporations required special state legislation, and they provided no, or extremely little, liability protection for shareholders. To secure a corporation charter, shareholders needed a state’s legislature approval; a very political act, and one latent with favoritism and abuses. Many prospective enterprises that might have benefited from incorporation were deterred from seeking it by having to run the political gauntlet. The second disincentive effected non-management shareholders, and through their non-action, management. Shareholders retained unlimited liability, yet they had little say in what liabilities the corporation was incurring, or how they were being discharged. Consequently, they had little incentive to invest capital in manager-owned corporations. Marshall’s description of a corporation in Dartmouth College v Woodward remained true until the mid-1880’s:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“a corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little reason existed to improve the benefits from incorporating for the scale and scope of market exchange remained essentially local; hence, businesses were small with no need to expand. One way for markets to grow was to conduct commerce over expanded distances, but that meant dealing with strangers and transacting under different state laws – laws meant to keep out “foreign” corporations. This transition from personal to impersonal markets was inevitable, however, both because of the propensity of merchants “to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another,” and because technological innovations were forever improving transportation and communication systems. Technological innovation drove economic growth by extending the reach of markets.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt; As impersonal, i.e. distant, markets became increasingly important, existing uncertainties in the institutions of commerce and contracts needed resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1800’s, a new technology driving market expansion was the steamboat, which in turn forced changing rules of commerce. Again, enter Marshall, this time with the legendary “Great Steamboat Case.” In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled in Gibbons v Ogden that the states could not obstruct interstate commerce. The case concerned whether New York State had the power to grant a monopoly “over navigation by fire or steam on all public waters within the boundaries of the state.” In 1789, the New York State legislature confiscated exclusive rights it had awarded only two years earlier in order to transfer these monopoly rights to the colonial hero, Robert R. Livingston, and his partner, the self-described inventor of the steamboat, Robert Fulton.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt; (Livingston was a Republican benefactor and the legislature was under Republican control, proving that state abuses of private property survived the adoption of the Constitution.) Livingston had the money and connections, Fulton, the entrepreneurial energy and mastery of the new technology. Yet Livingston would only act as venture capitalist if he and Fulton had no competitors.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1807, Livingston-Fulton’s Clermont successfully steamed up and down the Hudson River between New York and Albany. Immediately, a series of legal challenges were filed contesting the power of the state to grant private rights through exclusive franchise when the use of public waters was a common right. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Marshall, writing the opinion, “voided” the New York grant and in so doing created the doctrine of “dormant” power – Congress had the exclusive power to regulate commerce, whether it used it or not, and any state legislation to the contrary was void.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt; The Court also broadened the definition of commerce to include transportation – a decision important to future communication technologies – and reaffirmed its right to enforce the nationalization of the country, and commercial markets, over the rights of “member states.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibbons v. Ogden proved to be Marshall’s last judicial victory in a major commercial or contract case. In 1827, in Ogden v Saunders, the Court opined, over Marshall’s objection, that prospective bankruptcy laws were constitutional, states gave meaning to contracts not those making the contract.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt; Marshall’s unswerving belief in the natural law of contracts – “Individuals do not derive from government their right to contract, but bring that right with them into society” – no longer carried the day, and so ended his efforts to extend constitutional protection to contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As important as the courts had become in reading a favorable interpretation of contract law for commerce, and thus strengthening an enabling institution of capitalism, the courts were not alone. The growing importance of market exchange confounded the traditional “title” theory of contracts and its assumption of “customary” prices – under which contracts simply evidenced title and, if disputes arose, juries decided fair prices irrespective of contract terms.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt; Beginning as early as 1822, contract theorists began writing that markets and speculation were constrained under the title theory, and contracts should be decided solely by the “will” of the parties. By 1844 with the publication of William W. Story’s Treatise on the Law of Contracts, the meaning of a contract, driven by theory and confirmed by court decisions&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt; , had been transformed from one of title to wills – “Every contract is founded upon the mutual agreement of the parties.” The will theory placed contracts largely outside the influence of the polity to rule what could or could not be contracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement toward national markets and strengthened Federal powers led by Marshall slowed in 1835 with his death. The populist President Andrew Jackson, who believed in a strict constructionist interpretation of the Constitution – the supremacy of state power – appointed Roger Taney as the new Chief Justice in 1836. Taney’s belief in state powers would not mean he was anti-commerce however. In Proprietors of The Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of The Warren Bridge (1837), the Court ruled that the state of Massachusetts need not be constrained by a previous grant (contract) of monopoly powers when time and circumstance, i.e. the public good, required new contracts to sustain economic competition and growth:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc50&quot; href=&quot;#fn50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the rights of property are sacredly guarded, we must not forget that the community also has rights, and that the happiness and well being of every citizen depends on their faithful preservation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1837, the Jacksonian revolution’s philosophy that all would be fine if government stayed out of people’s way ran into the realities of integrating markets and technological change. In late March, news from New Orleans of declining cotton prices punctured a speculation bubble that led to financial panic and, by May, a full scale depression.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt; In 1837 alone, six hundred and fifty banks failed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt; Martin Van Buren, the new “Jacksonian” President did nothing, believing domestic economic matters were best left to the states. Laissez faire economic policy was also challenged by the growing problem of steamboat disasters – in 1830, for example, 1,500 people were killed by steamboat boiler explosions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt; Congress proved reluctant to interfere with commerce, and steamboat operators proved equally unwilling to cooperate and make travel safe. The problem persisted and, finally, in 1838, a modest boiler and hull inspection program was enacted. The Federal Government, having been mandated a role in steamboat practices by the Supreme Court – Gibbons v. Ogden – had to do something for not acting meant no change and more deaths. And then there were all the local groups that wanted Federal and state government support for the latest “internal improvement” – the railroads – similar to prior advances in transportation, i.e. canals, toll roads, etc. Laissez faire economic policies, so appropriate for an agricultural economy, seemed out-of-step with a struggling to-be-born industrial economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of the corporation remained to be decided. In 1839, in Bank of Augusta v Earle, the Supreme Court ruled on the rights of corporations to do business in states other than the one of their incorporation. As if a plea to good manners, the Court opined that the principle of comity&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt; meant foreign corporations had presumed rights to do business in a state unless the state adopted clear rules of exclusion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt; Yet, consistent with a strict constructionist’s interpretation, if a state wanted to exclude foreign corporations, they had the power to do so. The Court also made clear that corporations were not “citizens,” but “artificial persons,” and did not enjoy the privileges and immunities guaranteed in Article IV of the Constitution&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt; – that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. The Court confirmed Marshall’s description of a corporation as “an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt; The only basis of a corporation’s legitimacy was its state charter – where that charter was not recognized by law, the corporation simply did not exist.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc59&quot; href=&quot;#fn59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1842, both Congress and the Supreme Court acted to foster national commerce – both influenced by a then five year old depression. Congress tried by funding the development of the telegraph, while the Supreme Court contributed by improving the rules of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

For a while he painted portraits and minatures without shining success. It is hardly surprising, therefore, to meet him in 1796 trying to “sell” to the British government and private men the idea of cheap canals to provide “easy communication with the marts of trade.” In a book published in that year he elaborated an economic analysis drawn from Adam Smith and other more or less popular writers to show how his particular schemes would promote the wealth and power of England…..It is natural to find him arguing that cheapening communication would promote enterprise and thus increase the common stock of the nation and fully develop its resources. The main argument was that canals, as compared with roads, save manual labor in construction, maintenance, and use. But, while reducing labor costs, canals multiply produce and thus in turn increase population, which, by creating a greater demand, pushes improvements to a higher spiral…….Of course, the great lock canal companies, he argued, would immediately fly to Parliament and demand restrictions on the ground of protecting their investments and the value of affected mill and land property. A wise legislature, however, knows that competition is “the true polish of society.” It always takes as little profit as it can afford, but “monopoly as much as it can draw.” Competition, therefore, should be encouraged , restrictions should be as few as possible, and “circulation be as free as the air we breathe.”” Nevertheless, Fulton still sought a monopoly for steamboats.</p>"

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;As is the case with so many entrepreneurs, it is not that they have an entirely unique thought or concept, as important as that may be, but that they are stirred to action and see the thought brought to life, made real. Such is the case with Samuel F. B. Morse and his conceiving of the telegraph. One would never have thought such a thought would have struke Morse, for he was an artist, a painter, not an engineer or scientist strugggling with a technical problem. Nevertheless, as time will reveal, one can trace the origins of the telegraph, and thus the beginnings of the information revolution, to the mind of Morse who was somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean. Morse was returning home aboard a steam-powered passenger ship traveling from Europe to the United States after he had been studying abroad hoping to perfect his skills as a portrait painter. It happened out of the blue, one might say, after dinner one night after a particularly stimulating dinner conversation. Morse&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc60&quot; href=&quot;#fn60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt; wrote in his journal that night:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If …the presence of electricity can be made visible in any desired part of the circuit, I see no reason why intelligence might not be instantaneously transmitted by electricity to any distance.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc61&quot; href=&quot;#fn61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse had a vision of how the transmission of information could be radically transformed – and intelligence transmitted. How? Over a communications link, a connection, a metal wire, a channel through which electrical signals could be sent and heard. Telegraphy was made possible by the simultaneously advancing science of electricity – known in the vernacular as “lightning”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc62&quot; href=&quot;#fn62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt; By 1838, sixty-two competitive claims contested Morse’s discovery of the electric telegraph.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc63&quot; href=&quot;#fn63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse imposed intelligence on electricity by representing letters and numbers, as short and long bursts of electricity that could be heard as sounds, i.e. Morse code – actually first conceived by Alfred Vail.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc64&quot; href=&quot;#fn64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt; The telegraph then was both a system to send and receive modulated electrical signals over long distances through a wire, and a coding scheme to impose meaning on the signals. As much of a breakthrough as the telegraph was, it was inherently constrained by the modulation scheme – dots and dashes with pauses in between – and the bandwidth of the human ear, which is limited to approximately four thousand vibrations, or cycles, per second. (The success of the telegraph, however, drove innovation of communication technologies, as well as other information technologies, to use the eye, rather than the ear, because of its much higher bandwidth.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse spent years perfecting the telegraph, but eventually exhausted his access to funds. Concerned that the technology might fall into the wrong hands, he solicited the Federal government to assume responsibility for the telegraph. In 1838, Morse demonstrated his system to President Van Buren and his cabinet.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc65&quot; href=&quot;#fn65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt; A favorable reaction won no support in Congress. He was awarded a patent – but without resources, again tried to garner Congress’s support in 1842. This time, on recommendation of the House Committee on Commerce, $30,000 was appropriated to construct an experimental telegraph between Baltimore and Washington. The recommendation read, in part, to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;seize the present opportunity of securing to itself the regulation of a system which, if monopolized by a private company, might be used to the serious injury of the Post Office Department…your committee….earnestly recommends the adoption of it by the Government of the United States.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc66&quot; href=&quot;#fn66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court contributed to the growth in national commerce in 1842 as well. In Swift v. Tyson,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc67&quot; href=&quot;#fn67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt; the Supreme Court fundamentally changed how the rules of commercial law would be decided. Up to then, the Supreme Court attempted to resolve interstate commercial disputes by reference to the laws of the states in which the events transpired. No longer the Court proclaimed. It would now look to the norms of commercial behavior for the rules to settle disputes. Aggrieved citizens could sue across state boundaries to access this safe harbor from objected-to state laws. It was known as “diversity.” Diversity motivated states to bring their commercial rules into conformance with each other. If they did not, commercial rules could be decided by agencies of the Federal government – something no state cared to have happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversity rights were limited to citizens however. For corporations to have rights of diversity meant a shift in how they were treated under the law; even though they were the agents causing interstate disputes. In 1844, the Court, in Louisville, Cincinnati, and Charlestown Railroad Co v. Letson, ruled corporations could seek refuge in Federal courts, a right that the Constitution had only granted to citizens.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc68&quot; href=&quot;#fn68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt; (The Court came very close to making foreign, or out-of-state, corporations citizens.) The Letson decision proved controversial, with the Court itself seeming to change its mind in cases over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telegraph was by now about to prove again the importance of communication infrastructure to growing market demand. The Federal government’s experimental line between Baltimore and Washington D.C. was first demonstrated on May 24, 1844; the Washington site was the Supreme Court’s chamber.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc69&quot; href=&quot;#fn69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; An article reporting the event three days later in the New York Tribune read: “The miracle of annihilation of space is at length performed.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc70&quot; href=&quot;#fn70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; Commercial service began on April 1, 1845; the charge – one cent for every four characters sent.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc71&quot; href=&quot;#fn71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt; After the first three months of operations, revenues totalled $193.56, and expenses were $1,859.05. The second three months barely improved. Meanwhile, Morse and his three partners – Leonard D. Gale, Alfred Vail, andF. O. J.. “Fog” Smith – the owners of the Morse patents, formed the Magnetic Telegraph Company (MTC) and began negotiating licenses with private parties to build telegraph connections between other cities. MTC negotiated for an equity interest in all licensees. Then in December 1846, the Government threw in the towel on being venture capitalists,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt; especially with something that most Congressmen did not understand. The telegraph’s future was to be decided by the “productive capacity,” or “natural liberty,” of market competition. In the spring of 1847, the Baltimore and Washington line became part of MTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it would be seen if the entrepreneurial energies of market competition could accomplish what the Government would not – a national telegraph system. Said another way, could private interests bring about a public good where public efforts had failed? The entrepreneurial process received a big boost in April 1848, New York State passed a general incorporation law for telegraph companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc73&quot; href=&quot;#fn73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt; “Any number of persons” could now organize a telegraph company without having to obtain special legislature approval. A true expression of Jacksonian egalitarian principles and disdain for the practice of special charters, New York became a mecca to the entrepreneurs who saw unlimited economic potential in instantaneous communications. Telegraphic lines between cities grew like weeds, connecting markets that but days before took weeks for communications to exchange.By the early 1850’s, it was total telegraphic warfare.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc74&quot; href=&quot;#fn74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt; Fifty telegraph companies emerged to compete.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc75&quot; href=&quot;#fn75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt; The technological alternatives had been winnowed, however, from sixty-two to three: Morse’s, Bain’s and House’s.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc76&quot; href=&quot;#fn76&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt; Use followed as the intense competition drove prices downward – three-way competition between Boston and New York resulted in prices of one cent per word.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc77&quot; href=&quot;#fn77&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt; By 1851, in only five years, most large cities in the United States were interconnected.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc78&quot; href=&quot;#fn78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With interconnection came market growth. The first beneficiaries of lightning communications were the press. The information they made available enabled economic agents in the local markets to begin connecting to each other, expanding markets instantaneously, making them larger than anyone had ever imagined. “The lightning brought us quite a budget of news last night,” so reported a Pittsburgh newspaper in January 1848.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc79&quot; href=&quot;#fn79&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt; News included prices of cotton, flour, breadstuffs, wheat, rye, pork, and southern oats; money market conditions in England; and railroad schedules for freight shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An industrial economy gained critical momentum in the United States between 1851 and 1853. That is not to say that what came before was not important, only that in the space of those three years a number of events marked the acceleration of “take-off,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc80&quot; href=&quot;#fn80&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt; when the engines of commerce powered the transistion to an industrial economy. Two events were just mentioned: by 1851, all the major cities had been connected together by telegraphs, and the news press had significantly lowered information costs, thus stimulating economic exchange as trade arbitraging pricing and demand inequities. In so doing, economic exchange networks began to build strictly local markets into state, and even regional operations. In addition to the telegraph and news press, the critical mass causing the emergence of competitive capitalism included the railroads and the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The railroads revolutionized transportation. In 1853, a few years after the telegraph, the railroads provided connection to Chicago, making product exchange feasible on a new scale. The 1850’s were a period of rapid growth in the number of miles of rails in operation, as the Exhibit 2.1 Railway Mileage 1830-1890 shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-21-railway-mileage-1830-1890&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.1 Railway Mileage 1830-1890&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th&gt;Railway Mileage&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1830&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1840&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;2,818&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1850&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;9,021&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1860&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;30,626&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1870&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;52,922&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1880&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;93,262&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td&gt;1890&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td&gt;167,191&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The railroads&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc81&quot; href=&quot;#fn81&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt; were no cheaper than waterways – lakes, rivers and canals. As late as 1868, to ship a bushel of wheat from Chicago to New York by lake and canal cost 22.8 cents versus 42.6 cents by rail.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc82&quot; href=&quot;#fn82&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt; But the railroad more fully integrated locations, and markets not proximate to water, and began making faster and more reliable connections routine, especially during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court almost anticipated the crisis of institutions still on the horizon when it decided Cooley v. Board of Wardens (1851). Chief Justice Taney single abstention occurred when “his” Court applied Marshall’s doctrine of dormant powers&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc83&quot; href=&quot;#fn83&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt; – a power he strongly disagreed with – and enunciated the principle of a “uniform system:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whatever subjects of this power are in their nature national, or admit only of one uniform system, or plan of regulation, may justly be said to be of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress has the exclusive authority to regulate national, or natural, monopolies – uniform systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then came the Civil War. In the context of this reconstruction, the Civil War forced the coming together of markets by economic forces, unleashed first by the telegraph and then the railroads. The War had too many effects to enumerate here, but important to the relationship of economic growth were the beginnings of the states merging into a truly unified common market, a tremendous surge in industrial infrastructure investment, the creation of new personal networks, the disruption of existing relationships, Northern political authority to impose stiff tariffs, and changed Constitutional Law. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment became effective and, while meant to apply to slaves, its due process doctrine would prove important to capitalism:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nor shall any State deprive any person of…property, without due process of law;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Civil War, the telegraph prompted government activity to intervene in the economy to foster competition. In 1866, competition in telegraphy ended when MTC reorganized into the Western Union Telegraph Co. (WU), swallowing its last real competitor, as it had all others before it. (See Appendix 2.0 Western Union Telegraph Merger History.) Congress reacted. Within months, two separate, and competitive solutions to the “telegraph problems” of high prices and the perceived power of WU were proposed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc84&quot; href=&quot;#fn84&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt; The one by Senator B. Gratz Brown, Missouri Republican, would have the government operate a telegraph system in competition with WU. The alternative by Senator John Sherman, Ohio Republican, sought authority to promote a competitive private company. In Congressional deliberations, three issues loomed large: pricing, lack of information, and stock “watering.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc85&quot; href=&quot;#fn85&quot;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt; While the high prices of WU’s service motivated much contempt in Congress, it lacked political punch. Those using telegraphs were primarily businesses and the news presses&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc86&quot; href=&quot;#fn86&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt; who were more interested in timely and accurate transmission than costs. WU’s costs seemed almost inconsequential to them when compared to communication costs pre-telegraph.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc87&quot; href=&quot;#fn87&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt; The lack of information made Congress unsure of itself – What were the facts? But the only source of information was WU, the monopoly, making any information they provided seem suspect. A compelling argument for starting a competitive service to WU was for information to inform future legislation. More generally, Congress realized regulation meant having to have information, a lesson to re-emerge to inform the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock watering was more complicated – and reflected deep misunderstanding of what was required to raise private risk capital. Watering referred to the practice of corporations issuing more stock than that for which it received payment, and had two causes. The first was the costs of raising “venture” capital. For example, the charter of the corporation formed by Morse and his associates in 1845, Magnetic Telegraph Company (MTC), read: “For fifty dollars paid in by subscribers…..a certificate for one share of one hundred dollars shall be issued by the Trustees.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc88&quot; href=&quot;#fn88&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt; In essence, the subscriber was given a one hundred percent return, on paper, as incentive to risk investment, as well as a promised current return as dividend payments. What Congressmen seemed unwilling to acknowledge was that high risk necessitated high return.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc89&quot; href=&quot;#fn89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt; Government had proved unwilling to finance the risky investment of building telegraphs (1846), why should private investors be any more willing to throw their money away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporations also watered stock when shares were issued to inventors and management as incentive to be successful. Again, from the MTC charter: “Contemporaneously certificates of stock in the same form, and to the same amount, shall be issued to the Grantors of the Patent Right, to each in proportion to his interest, so that the amount of stock issued to them and to the subscribers respectively, shall always be the same.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc90&quot; href=&quot;#fn90&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; Insiders, MTC’s grantors, would own half the corporation as would the investors. If the project went well, they would be rewarded along with those who had invested capital.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc91&quot; href=&quot;#fn91&quot;&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1866, Congress passed the Postal Roads Act in response to Sherman’s efforts to promote a private company. (See Appendix 2.1 Postal Roads Act of 1866) This Act did not create a company to compete with WU, but made public land and resources thereon available to anyone who wanted to offer telegraph service as incentive to do so. It gave telegraph companies the: “right to construct , maintain, and operate lines of telegraph through and over any portion of the public domain of the United States, and over and along any military or post road of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still meaningful competition did not emerge to challenge WU, so efforts again were made in Congress to curtail WU’s power. In 1868, two new bills were introduced; one on behalf of an enterprising citizen, Gardiner G. Hubbard, that called for Federal incorporation of a private corporation – the United States Postal Telegraph Company. Hubbard envisioned this new company only transmitting messages between post offices, with post offices accepting and delivering the messages. WU, wiser to managing legislation from the 1866 experience, successfully blocked both bills in early 1869.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc92&quot; href=&quot;#fn92&quot;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt; Hubbard’s also went down in defeat because Congress was unwilling to grant “special privileges…to realize a large profit..”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc93&quot; href=&quot;#fn93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt; In 1870, a new bill was introduced to buy WU by mid-1872.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc94&quot; href=&quot;#fn94&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt; It failed. Hubbard also continued to press for legislation, but, in 1873, he was again stymied. In 1875, legislation came up again, and failed. WU’s monopoly continued.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc95&quot; href=&quot;#fn95&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt; Congress proved it too was protecting private property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as Congress proved unwilling to grant privileges and immunities of incorporation, the states themselves were beginning to change how incorporations were granted. Most states had by now passed “dual incorporation systems,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc96&quot; href=&quot;#fn96&quot;&gt;96&lt;/a&gt; making small incorporations available on demand. Even so, the legislatures remained involved in most grants of corporation charters. For example, by 1875, New Jersey had had a dual incorporation system for twenty three years, during which time 2551 incorporations required legislation and 982 did not. In response to popular will, the New Jersey legislature passed a law drastically curtailing its control over corporations; one so radical, a special election of the people of the state was called. It received “decisive approval. The amendment provided that ‘the legislature shall not pass private, local or special laws ….Granting to any corporation, association, or individual any exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise whatever.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc97&quot; href=&quot;#fn97&quot;&gt;97&lt;/a&gt; The people had spoken – at least those of New Jersey – no one should receive privileges or immunities in preference to anyone else. Everyone had equal opportunity to form and create corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1870’s, the railroads also began feeling the outrage of the public. Railroads had been the beneficiaries of generous public largess – land grants, loans, mail contracts and even purchases of common stock&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc98&quot; href=&quot;#fn98&quot;&gt;98&lt;/a&gt; – so when they began operations, and posted rates that were viewed as monopolistic pricing, cries were heard that they had violated the public trust. The western agricultural interests began forming Granger organizations in 1867 and pressed for state laws regulating railroads. Numerous interest groups joined the Grangers: western Pennsylvania oil companies, eastern merchants, and oddly enough, the railroads themselves.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc99&quot; href=&quot;#fn99&quot;&gt;99&lt;/a&gt; (The railroads, engaged in ruthless competition, sought government regulation as a way for those holding property to protect what they had. And one way was to restrict market entry, a privilege they would enjoy for agreeing to be regulated.) A series of court challenges were mounted to these regulatory laws, culminating in 1877 with the Supreme Court decision inMunn v. Illinois.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc100&quot; href=&quot;#fn100&quot;&gt;100&lt;/a&gt; The Court ruled states had the right to regulate businesses “affected with a public interest,” or that created “a common charge or burden upon the citizens,” or which were “a practical monopoly, to which the citizen is compelled to resort.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc101&quot; href=&quot;#fn101&quot;&gt;101&lt;/a&gt; The Court confirmed the right of the states to control commerce, although the issue of interstate regulation was left unaddressed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc102&quot; href=&quot;#fn102&quot;&gt;102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in 1877, in Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union.,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc103&quot; href=&quot;#fn103&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that telegraphy was affected with a public interest. The case involved a Florida chartered monopoly, Pensacola Telegraph, that had sued to enjoin the Pensacola and Lousiville Railroad from granting WU telegraph right of ways that effectively circumvented its monopoly. Citing the Sherman Act of 1866, the Court ruled that a railroad could grant telegraph rights to anyone as long as they did not interfere with another’s physical lines. Furthermore, the Court extended the concept of public interest to the telegraphs, ruling that the Federal Government had the power to regulate an innovation that “has changed the habits of business and become one of the necessities of commerce.” The Federal Government “legislates for the whole nation, and is not embarrassed by State lines. Its peculiar duty is to protect one part of the country from encroachments by another upon the national rights which belong to all.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc104&quot; href=&quot;#fn104&quot;&gt;104&lt;/a&gt; Ironically, the Court cited the 1866 Act that had been meant to encourage competition against WU as reason WU had the right to extend its network to the disadvantage of its competition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc105&quot; href=&quot;#fn105&quot;&gt;105&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1877, in two cases decided but months apart, the Supreme Court had ruled that the states could regulate businesses with a public interest, and, yet, the technology of the telegraph was such a necessity of commerce, thus affected with a special, as if over-riding public interest, that it came under Federal authority. Where was control of monopolies affected with a public interest to be situated? Who was going to decide the balance of public good and private interest, the Federal government or the states? And if the Federal government, what were the respective roles of the legislature, executive, and judiciary to be? And who was to decide what businesses were affected with a public interest? And for those not holding public interest, did their fates rest simply with market competition among corporations? The institutions of competitive capitalism were straining at their logical seams.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1873, the world economy fell victim to the Great Depression. For an interminable twenty-three years, economic life seemed as if on a slippery slope to a destiny neither understood, nor to be escaped. It was little different in America. A first depression began in 1873 and lasted to 1879 – the longest in history. Deflation also set in, lasting twenty years until 1893, when prices were 64% of those of 1873, a free-fall of 36%. (See Exhibit 2.2 Deflation 1850-1950) The many small businesses that constituted competitive capitalism were being shown to be what they really were – small, local monopolies. For those that could not adapt to the new competitive conditions, it meant failure, and, between 1869 and 1879, 64,000, or 15%, of them did. (See Exhibit 2.3 Business Concerns) Paradoxically, 274,000 new businesses formed, a decade over decade growth rate of an astounding 222%. An economy in historic aggregate decline, and, simultaneously, unprecedented churning and new growth among businesses. What were owner-managers of the businesses of competitive capitalism to do? And given the institutional constraints of state-based control, uncertain corporation rights, and the lack of capital markets, what could they do? Out of this caldron of uncertainty and change emerged corporate capitalism – an economy of Big Business and Big Government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-22-deflation-1850-1950&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.2 Deflation 1850-1950&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-2-deflation-1850-1950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.2 Deflation 1850-1950&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American depression that began in 1873 happened suddenly. In September, railroads’ defaulted on debt payments and caused a financial panic.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc106&quot; href=&quot;#fn106&quot;&gt;106&lt;/a&gt; Speculation in railroad securities collapsed, soon followed by the failures of prominent business firms, brokerages, and banks; the stock exchange closed for ten days; banks suspended currency payments; gold reached a new low by year-end, and silver was demonetized.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc107&quot; href=&quot;#fn107&quot;&gt;107&lt;/a&gt; The years to follow were described by those there as a depression and disturbance of industry.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc108&quot; href=&quot;#fn108&quot;&gt;108&lt;/a&gt; Economic growth that had seemed so certain, when simply left to the competitive forces of natural liberty, became elusive. Using change in Gross National Product as proxy for economic growth, robust growth of 5.58 percent in the late 1860’s slowed to 2.55 percent by the end of the depression in the period 1893 to 1897 – the first “industrial” depression.

In 1859, Federal debt totaled $58 million; in 1866, $2,756 million. The Federal Government, in essence, borrowed more than $2.5 billion prosecuting the war.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc109&quot; href=&quot;#fn109&quot;&gt;109&lt;/a&gt; The money sloshed around in the economy until extracted – the government began paying down the national debt in 1867, and did so every year but one until 1879 – or until the exchange needs of a market economy used the money.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc110&quot; href=&quot;#fn110&quot;&gt;110&lt;/a&gt; Once the Civil War money transient dampened, the drastically reduced demand for goods and services by the Government meant supply chased less demand, and so prices dropped. (The economies between 1869-1873 had average GNP of $6.5 billion; the increases in the national debt in the two years 1865 and 1866 were each more than $600 million, 10% of the then economies.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc111&quot; href=&quot;#fn111&quot;&gt;111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributing to the decline of prices as well was the telegraph. The telegraph had been seen for the change agent it truly was as early as 1847: “operations are made in one day with its aid, by repeated communications, which could not be done in from two to four weeks by mail – enabling [businessmen] to make purchases and sales which otherwise would be of no benefit to them, in consequence of length of time consumed in negotiation.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc112&quot; href=&quot;#fn112&quot;&gt;112&lt;/a&gt; In 1869, 8 million telegraph messages were being sent and received. By 1879, the number had jumped to 25 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc113&quot; href=&quot;#fn113&quot;&gt;113&lt;/a&gt; Information riding lightning made for drastically more transactions, significantly lower transaction costs,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc114&quot; href=&quot;#fn114&quot;&gt;114&lt;/a&gt; and prompted the emergence of entirely new markets, such as security trading and commodity markets&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc115&quot; href=&quot;#fn115&quot;&gt;115&lt;/a&gt; (using contracts never before imagined). Price dispersion, “the measure of ignorance in the marketplace” had been attacked, driving prices lower and uncompetitive firms from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-24-growth-in-gnp-per-annum&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.4 Growth in GNP Per Annum&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GNP Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1869-78 to 1874-83&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5.58%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1874-83 to 1879-88&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.76%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1879-88 to 1884-93&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.68%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1884-93 to 1889-98&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.55%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Livingston (Robert E. Gallman, “Gross National Product in the UnitedStates, 1834 - 1909,” Output, Employment, and Productivity in the UnitedStates after 1800 (new York, 1966). Tables 2,6 at pp. 9,22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower prices, talk of depression everywhere, record number of business concerns going under, no end in sight – and on the other hand – record numbers of new concerns forming, and for the adaptive firm, new markets with growing demand for product. The telegraph revolutionized business news, and then made it possible for entrepreneurs to act on the news and contact distant buyers or sellers. To them, lower prices meant more business and profits. It also was incentive to successful industrial firms to invest in expanding production capacity.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc116&quot; href=&quot;#fn116&quot;&gt;116&lt;/a&gt; Taking excess information and transaction costs out of commerce did not necessarily mean unprofitable business. Marginal sales could still mean very profitable sales, for if the fixed costs of operations were already covered, new, marginal, sales need only recover variable costs before contributing to the absolute dollars of profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businessman acted. The number of industrial firms, those classified as factories, were the same in 1869 as 1879 – 252,000 to 253,000 – but the value of product sold increased by 59% to $5.4 billion, up from $3.4 billion. Taking into account deflation of 16%, unit output grew even faster than dollar growth. (See Exhibit 2.5 Manufactures: Summary, 1849 to 1923) Industrial concerns – increasingly operating as corporations – were getting both larger, in scale and scope,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc117&quot; href=&quot;#fn117&quot;&gt;117&lt;/a&gt; and becoming more efficient producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency, or productivity, became essential when declining prices finally began affecting profits. Fortunately, a new source of energy, steam, was becoming more widely used. In the 1870’s, steam became more important than water power for industrial production.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc118&quot; href=&quot;#fn118&quot;&gt;118&lt;/a&gt; Steam enabled a gigantic – discontinuous – improvement in the productive layout and location of factories. For those willing to take the business and capital risks of upgrading to steam, the potential rewards were unprecedented. Not until after the turn of the century did steam power give way to electricity. (Electricity first found use in factories as electric lighting,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc119&quot; href=&quot;#fn119&quot;&gt;119&lt;/a&gt; and not until the 1920’s would it become the dominant source of power used in manufacturing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As factories were designed to leverage the use of steam energy, they could also upgrade to the latest new capital equipment, the assets needed to competitively produce product.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc120&quot; href=&quot;#fn120&quot;&gt;120&lt;/a&gt; And new technologies began to affect the productivity potential of capital equipment in the mid-to-late 1870’s, and were ubiquitous in the 1880’s.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc121&quot; href=&quot;#fn121&quot;&gt;121&lt;/a&gt; Where did all the innovation come from? As soon as the Civil War was over, the annual number of patents awarded took a step function increase from roughly 6,000 to 20,000 patents awarded a year. (See Exhibit 2.6 Patents 1850-1890) A large number of socio-culturalinfluences caused inventive activity, including two decades of experience developing “American manufacturing,” building and improving railroads and the telegraph, and government spending during the Civil War.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc122&quot; href=&quot;#fn122&quot;&gt;122&lt;/a&gt; The needed executives to manage these expansions and new activities were just then becoming available, owing much to the experience gained building and managing the railroads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-25-manufactures-summary-1849-to-1923&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.5 Manufactures: Summary, 1849 to 1923&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

C.: Government Printing Office, 1926)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rewards of financial success awaited those organizations expanding productive capacity. Successful business concerns acted, and grew in scale and scope. But to do so meant doing business interstate, and having employees and other representatives in other states – two acts, among many, highly constrained by the existing institutions of competitive capitalism. Firm growth also meant new, increased capital investment. During the 1870’s, the period including the longest depression in history, capital investment in factories increased $1.1 billion, up 65%. In the 1880’s, capital investment increased another $3.7 billion, up 134%. Where and how was this new capital raised if the capital markets of the 1880’s did not make it possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This then was the crisis: growing markets and technological advances rewarded industrial expansion and the growth of large corporations. Yet expansion also brought corporations into direct conflict with state laws meant to prevent interstate commerce. Nor did the capital markets exist to finance corporate growth. These constraints would be resolved in the next stage of capitalism, corporate capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-26-patents-1850-1890&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.6 Patents 1850-1890&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-6-patents-1850-1890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.6 Patents 1850-1890&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

To repeat a rather familiar roll call:during the 1870s and 1880s the roller mill was introduced in the processing of oatmeal and flour, refrigerated cars in meat packing, the pneumatic malting process and temperature-controlled tank car in brewing, and food preparation and can-sealing machinery allowed for the mass production of canned meat, vegetables, fish, and soups.During the 1880s, the chemical industry saw the introduction first of the Solvay and then the electrolytic processees in the production of alkalis, and the discovery of the process of producing acetic acid and acetates as byproducts of charcoal production.In the petroleum industry, John Merril’s development of the seamless wrought-iron or steel-bottomed still allowed for a sharp increase in plant size between 1867 and 1873. The 1870s saw the development of the long-distance crude oil pipeline and the steel tank car.In the 1870s and 1880s the Bessemer and open-hearth processes were widely adopted in steel making.In the mid-1880s, new developments in electro-metallurgy made commercial mass production ofaluminum possible.During the same period, a large number of mechanical and chemical innovations were devised that greatly facilitated the process of refining and working various metals.The development, beginning in 1880, of improved metal-working machinery based on the use of high-speed-tool steel allowed for the production of a wide variety of better machines with finer tolerances.The typewriter, invented in the late 1870s, was mass produced during the 1880s.The electrical street railway car came into widespread use during the late 1880s.In addition, of course, the basic transcontinental railroad and national telegraph networks – infrastructure necessary for the rise of firms capable of distributing products on a national basis – were complete by 1880.”</p>"

The small, owner-managed businesses of competitive capitalism were overwhelmed by the coming of large, publicly-traded corporations coalescing to oligopolies and corporate capitalism. Concurrently, the locus of corporate control was shifting from the states to a combination of Federal institutions and market forces. Big Business certainly co-evolved with Big Government; where Big Government was Federal authority and growth in use of agencies. Big Business also meant big investments, investments that necessitated access to capital. Financial markets would come to replace the states in granting, and policing, corporation capital. Contemporaneously, corporations also become recognized by the Constitution as persons, persons being managed by individuals acting as agents, no longer directly by the owners. Amidst these shifting times, AT&amp;amp;T was founded, locking into the strategy and structure it would retain for nearly seventy years, and the national telecommunications network assumed its dominant design architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the end for competitive capitalism dates to 1872 when John D. Rockefeller, chief executive of the largest petroleum refiner, Standard Oil Company, led the organization of the National Refiners Association.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc124&quot; href=&quot;#fn124&quot;&gt;124&lt;/a&gt; It was an effort by the largest competitive refiners to coordinate collective behavior to escape, or at least moderate, the problems of increasing output and decreasing prices then crippling their industry – problems made worse by the weakening economy. Rockefeller believed that the refiners needed to act in unison to bring order to their competitive conditions. So just as others which had tried to coordinate collective behavior before them – telegraphy (Six Nations 1857)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc125&quot; href=&quot;#fn125&quot;&gt;125&lt;/a&gt; and railroads (Saratoga Conference 1873),&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc126&quot; href=&quot;#fn126&quot;&gt;126&lt;/a&gt; and even the body politic (Articles of Confederation 1781-1788) – the petroleum refiners tried to effect collective behavior, and failed. The Association simply lacked the authority to make the difficult decisions that were the source of operating efficiencies and profitability, such as closing plants and building fewer, and significantly larger, plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be deterred, Rockefeller and Standard Oil next negotiated favorable railroad contracts to transport oil, and then formed an alliance of refiners to participate with them. To insure success of the alliance, Standard Oil exchanged its stock for stock of each participating corporation. But at the time, corporations could not hold stock of other companies except by special charters or by virtue of being affected with a public interest (railroads, telegraphs, and public utilities). The trustees of the trusts formed to hold the stock were then current Standard Oil shareholders; as late as 1879, Standard Oil had only forty-one shareholders.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc127&quot; href=&quot;#fn127&quot;&gt;127&lt;/a&gt; By 1881, alliance members controlled 90% of the refining capacity of the industry, and Standard Oil, through an extensive series of trusts, held a majority of the shares of stock of the alliance members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reaction to Standard Oil’s actions, crude oil producers constructed a pipeline to circumvent Standard’s railroad lock-out, which forced Standard and the alliance to construct pipelines of their own. To optimize use of the jointly owned pipelines meant making mutually dependent decisions about which refineries to close and where to build new ones. No longer would simple coordination suffice, the twenty-six companies&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc128&quot; href=&quot;#fn128&quot;&gt;128&lt;/a&gt; needed to act as one. At the same time, Standard Oil, with assets in thirteen states and several foreign countries,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc129&quot; href=&quot;#fn129&quot;&gt;129&lt;/a&gt; found itself under attack in Pennsylvania where the state was attempting to tax not only the assets of foreign corporations held in the state, but foreign corporation properties held everywhere. Again, the issue was how best to organize – to both operate effectively and avoid state harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating one corporation to hold all of its assets was not an option. Corporations could not hold stock in corporations of other states – foreign corporations were the enemy, never were they to be allowed to control state corporations. After much work, Standard Oil’s executives determined they had three ways of legally organizing to effect common corporate ownership with centralized executive authority: form a holding company, an unincorporated joint-stock company, or a trust.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc130&quot; href=&quot;#fn130&quot;&gt;130&lt;/a&gt; New York was the only state granting holding company charters, but to secure such a charter required special legislative action. Standard Oil rejected the holding company as too difficult to obtain. The problem of the unincorporated joint-stock association, also available in New York, brought a loss of financial privacy, a sacrifice they were unwilling to make. Therefore, they decided to undertake “a careful development of the plan of holding stocks in trust, while the business was managed by elected representatives of the beneficiaries.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc131&quot; href=&quot;#fn131&quot;&gt;131&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 1882, Standard Oil innovated a new form of business organization when it formed the Standard Oil Trust under the laws of the State of Ohio. Each trust and corporation of the alliance exchanged their stock certificates for Standard Oil Trust certificates, and agreed to have their separate companies run as if one: “in a manner….most conducive to the best interests of the holders of the said trust certificates.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc132&quot; href=&quot;#fn132&quot;&gt;132&lt;/a&gt; Nine trustees, under the leadership of John D. Rockefeller, were appointed to supervise the combined investments, and became the executive “management” of the collective companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc133&quot; href=&quot;#fn133&quot;&gt;133&lt;/a&gt; (The properties put into the trust were valued at $70 million, that is $70 million of trust certificates were issued, yet the net book value of the assets totalled only $55 million – the difference can be thought to represent the earnings potential of the company, although at the time the practice was known as watered stock.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc134&quot; href=&quot;#fn134&quot;&gt;134&lt;/a&gt; ) Among the first acts of the Trustees were to organize corporations in any state where the Trust had property to hold title to all property in that state. In this way, no property would be held by foreign corporations and thus subject to state acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Standard Oil Trust represented a new means of owning private property. It also distinguished the role of agents from owners. The separation of stewardship from ownership is known as agency.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc135&quot; href=&quot;#fn135&quot;&gt;135&lt;/a&gt; Agency emerged naturally when owners of corporations ceased being management, and management ceased being owners. As a consequence, a conflict of interest developed – agents might not always act in the owners’ best interest, but their own. This issue was less important in the case of the Standard Oil Trust because Rockefeller remained both executive officer and a very significant shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the operating results of Standard Oil from 1882 and 1885, the reorganization worked. Management achieved sought for economies of scale by reducing the number of refining units from fifty-three to twenty-two, concentrating output in three refineries, and scheduling total throughput as one operation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc136&quot; href=&quot;#fn136&quot;&gt;136&lt;/a&gt; The average cost of producing a gallon of refined oil fell from 1.5 cents to .5 cents, with the costs of production in the newer, and larger, refineries even lower.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc137&quot; href=&quot;#fn137&quot;&gt;137&lt;/a&gt; Gaining scale had brought economic savings. Those in other industries then saw the advantages they thought existed for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard Oil Trust became the first Big industrial Business, as distinct from the railroads and telegraph. It was also the first trust. The concept of a trust, the exercising of management control through the owning of certificates rather than real assets, was as if another world to many. But the path had been lit for others to follow. To state advocates, it felt like ceding control of their economic futures to distant strangers. And based on their experiences with the railroads, relationships that had generally started out with state and citizen largess, Big Businesses deserved to be treated with great suspicion if not contempt. Big Business was synonymous with monopoly, the antithesis of cultural values and the basic belief system&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc138&quot; href=&quot;#fn138&quot;&gt;138&lt;/a&gt; that held market competition to be far superior to monopoly in generating economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public expressed outcry over the formation of the Standard Oil Trust. The states and Congress quickly launched investigations: Were corporations evading control by the states without any Federal controls to replace them? What they learned, combined with the public support the investigations impassioned, inspired attorney generals of the states to file lawsuits – known as “quo Warranto” suits – “challenging the legal power of corporations to restructure themselves” as trusts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc139&quot; href=&quot;#fn139&quot;&gt;139&lt;/a&gt; The states viewed themselves in battle with corporations to control the productive capital of society – the right to decide best use of both public and private property. It was a battle the states were destined to lose. In a study comparing the flow of moneys to state governments, such as taxes, with the flow of insurance premiums paid by state citizens to foreign corporations over the period 1880 to 1887, the states collected far less moneys than did the insurance companies. The locus of economic power no longer rested with the polity. Economic power now rested in the fate of corporations. Little wonder the states viewed themselves as victims of absentee landlords.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc140&quot; href=&quot;#fn140&quot;&gt;140&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Quo Warranto lawsuits&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc141&quot; href=&quot;#fn141&quot;&gt;141&lt;/a&gt; to outlaw trusts did not deter others from following Standard Oil – cottonoil refining (1884); linseed oil refining (1885); whiskey distilling (1887); sugar refining (1887); to name but a few.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc142&quot; href=&quot;#fn142&quot;&gt;142&lt;/a&gt; Attendant to the efficiencies achieved in all these consolidations were the forced closings of many small, local corporations. The corporations of competitive capitalism were under siege. They too raised the specter of Big Business – large corporations will challenge governments’ control,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc143&quot; href=&quot;#fn143&quot;&gt;143&lt;/a&gt; or they will price gouge customers while earning “monopolistic profits.” To those aligned against the trusts, the right of corporations to exist remained rooted in improving local economic conditions for the public good, not in improving the profits of foreign corporations. Giving grit to the cause of those resisting Big Business were the concurrent battles the states had with the original Big Businesses – the railroads.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc144&quot; href=&quot;#fn144&quot;&gt;144&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victors of the Munn v Illinois decision in 1877 had fought for the rights of the states to regulate railroads. These Western farmers, Pennsylvania oil producers, Eastern businessmen, and even railroad executives concluded that state-level control of railroads was neither working nor a viable option.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc145&quot; href=&quot;#fn145&quot;&gt;145&lt;/a&gt; For help they turned to Congress, and began lobbying for Federal legislation regulating railroads. They argued that only Congress had the authority to regulate interstate commerce, and it urgently needed to do so. For years, the issue stirred debate, but little else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 1886, the Supreme Court, in deciding Wabash, St. L. &amp;amp; Pac. Ry. v. Illinois, made it clear that state laws could not invade interstate commerce – Congress had that responsibility. But if Congress did not act to regulate interstate commerce, remaining “dormant,” then the police powers of the states gave them the right to regulate railroads, even if there were interstate effects.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc146&quot; href=&quot;#fn146&quot;&gt;146&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within four months Congress passed the Act to Regulate Commerce of 1887, better known as the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc147&quot; href=&quot;#fn147&quot;&gt;147&lt;/a&gt; The Act had rules: “Section 1 stated that all rates were to be just and reasonable; Section 2 outlawed personal discrimination; Section 3 prohibited undue preference or prejudice; Section 4 prohibited charging higher rates for a shorter haul than a longer haul under substantially similar circumstances and conditions; Section 5 prohibited pooling agreements; and Section 6 stipulated that all rates were to be published and adhered to.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc148&quot; href=&quot;#fn148&quot;&gt;148&lt;/a&gt; It also created an administrative body, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), to enforce and interpret the written rules in the spirit of the founding ideology. A new institution, the Federal regulation of railroads, had been created. The ICC was the first use ever of an administrative agency, and marks the beginnings of Federal administrative law. The innovation of an administrative agency by the government was in reaction to the realized impossibility of effecting direct legislative control over an activity changing as rapidly as the railroads – it would be the state legislatures having to control corporations all over again. Imagine Congress deciding whether a railroad rate was fair or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Congress passed the ICA economic uncertainty had been reduced, not completely, but enough to unleash a surge of railroad construction. The increase in mileage in 1887 totalled 12,879 miles, more than any other year, up 60% over 1886 and 332% over 1885.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc149&quot; href=&quot;#fn149&quot;&gt;149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The railroads had both resisted and welcomed Federal involvement. The relationship had been somewhat resolved. Not so with industrial corporations, those not affected with a public interest: What protections were provided corporations by the Constitution? If they were not citizens, what were they? In 1886, the question was decided, and no longer did corporations exist as legal artifacts. In Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the Supreme Court opined:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc150&quot; href=&quot;#fn150&quot;&gt;150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The defendent Corporations are persons within the intent of the clause in section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in 1888, the nature of state control over corporations changed forever. For in that year, the State of New Jersey passed a law permitting “holding companies:”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc151&quot; href=&quot;#fn151&quot;&gt;151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Any company, incorporated or unincorporated, which is in a position to control, or materially to influence, the management of one or more other companies by virtue, in part at least, of its ownership of securities in the other company or companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It made legal the trust form of organization&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc152&quot; href=&quot;#fn152&quot;&gt;152&lt;/a&gt; – the very same trusts that were the object of state quo Warranto suits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc153&quot; href=&quot;#fn153&quot;&gt;153&lt;/a&gt; New Jersey became a “charter mongering” state currying favor of corporate “promoters”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc154&quot; href=&quot;#fn154&quot;&gt;154&lt;/a&gt; because New Jersey needed revenue. So much of New Jersey’s property was owned by the railroads, and thus immune from property taxes by prior agreement, that the state was sinking ever deeper into debt.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc155&quot; href=&quot;#fn155&quot;&gt;155&lt;/a&gt; Among all states, New Jersey ranked second highest in level of taxation on real property, yet last in income generated.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc156&quot; href=&quot;#fn156&quot;&gt;156&lt;/a&gt; New Jersey broke ranks with the other states because it saw an opportunity to generate needed revenues from incorporation fees and annual franchise taxes, even though to do so meant attracting corporations with grants of ever broader privileges and immunities. Ironically, it was New Jersey’s past largesse to the railroads that now resulted in further largesse to industrial corporations. New Jersey became known as the “traitor state” — or more appropriately, the”State of Camden and Amboy” – in reference to the railroad monopoly they had granted of the same name which had “almost obtained control of the State government.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc157&quot; href=&quot;#fn157&quot;&gt;157&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, New Jersey passed other laws: corporations could purchase stock of other corporations and any other property with stock of their own; and directors were absolved of any responsibility for knowing the value of assets on any basis other than that presented to them –making it possible for directors to pay any price wanted for other corporations, and issuing whatever stock required.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc158&quot; href=&quot;#fn158&quot;&gt;158&lt;/a&gt; Indicative of a discontinuity, no new trusts were ever formed after the enactment of New Jersey’s holding company laws.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc159&quot; href=&quot;#fn159&quot;&gt;159&lt;/a&gt; In just two years, by 1890, 1,626 corporations – corporations that wanted to become large, national corporations –had moved their legal home to New Jersey.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc160&quot; href=&quot;#fn160&quot;&gt;160&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress launched hearings on trusts in 1888.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc161&quot; href=&quot;#fn161&quot;&gt;161&lt;/a&gt; The Republican party Presidential platform of the same year called for government regulation of monopolies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc162&quot; href=&quot;#fn162&quot;&gt;162&lt;/a&gt; In the following two years, five states enacted laws prohibiting combinations or restraints of trade. To many the clash between the existing state institutions and the desire of corporations to be organized by market boundaries, not state boundaries, was anticipated. For example in 1889, a young Woodrow Wilson, before becoming Governor of New Jersey, wrote in The State: Elements of Historical and Practical Politics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The plan of leaving to the states the regulation of all that portion of the law which most nearly touches our daily interests, and which in effect determines the whole structure of our society, the whole organic action of industry and business, has some serious disadvantages: disadvantages which make themselves more and more emphatically felt as modern tendencies of social and political development more and more prevail over the old conservative forces. . . . . State divisions, it turns out, are not natural economic divisions; they practically constitute no barriers at all to any distinctly marked industrial regions.Variety and conflict of laws, consequently, have brought not a little friction and confusion into our social and business arrangements.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc163&quot; href=&quot;#fn163&quot;&gt;163&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years later, David Wells, thought by many to be the early Dean of economics, put the rise of trusts and Big Business in terms of how people saw their lives being lived:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc164&quot; href=&quot;#fn164&quot;&gt;164&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The predominant feeling induced by a review and consideration of the numerous and complex economic changes and disturbances that have occurred since 1873, is undoubtedly, in the case of very many persons, discouraging and pessimistic. The questions which naturally suggest themselves, and in fact are being continually asked, are: Is mankind being made happier or better by this increased knowledge and application of the forces of nature, and a consequent increased power of production and distribution? Or, on the contrary, is not the tendency of this new condition of things, as Dr. Siemans, of Berlin, has expressed it, “to the destruction of all of our ideals and to coarse sensualism; to aggravate injustice in the distribution of wealth; diminish to individual laborers the opportunities for independent work, and thereby bring them into a more dependent position; and, finally, is not the supremacy of birth and the sword about to be superseded by the still more oppressive reign of inherited or acquired property?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 2, 1890, Congress finally acted and passed the Sherman Act to control the rise of trusts. It represented the second new Federal institution created by Congress to control the rise of Big Businesses within the short span of three years. Unlike the ICA of 1887, however, the Sherman Act&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc165&quot; href=&quot;#fn165&quot;&gt;165&lt;/a&gt; called for enforcement not by an administrative agency, like the ICC, but by the Federal Courts. Critical clauses of the Act read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Section I. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor…&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc166&quot; href=&quot;#fn166&quot;&gt;166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intended effect of the Sherman Antitrust Act, as it is more commonly known, had been changed by the passing of the holding company laws of New Jersey. How much so would soon be known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framers of the Sherman Act believed that the states had all the rights and authority they needed to exclude foreign corporations and control corporation governance. If states objected to New Jersey’s more liberal incorporation laws, they simply had to file suit against the outlaw foreign corporations – read New Jersey’s corporations – on the grounds that no state allowed state-based corporations to sell their stock to foreign corporations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc167&quot; href=&quot;#fn167&quot;&gt;167&lt;/a&gt; However, there were now so many foreign corporations in every state, the states found themselves in an uncomfortable bind. To eliminate foreign corporations meant forcing those corporations to choose one of three options: move their operations out-of-state, sell them to a state-based corporation, or close them down. Since forcing operations to move out-of-state, or to close them down were political disasters – loss of jobs, capital investment, and state income – and it was far from certain whether reverting operations to state-based operations would lead to success, or improved consumer benefits, no state filed suit against New Jersey corporations. Instead, the states decided to talk, hoping to find some common ground to guide their actions – to create uniform policies. All the while, more corporations moved aggressively to expand first to state and then to interstate operations, growing in both scale and scope. These expansionist activities, however, required capital, much more capital than they were generating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1891, New Jersey upped the ante again. This time passing an incorporation law permitting corporations to own the stock of other corporations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc168&quot; href=&quot;#fn168&quot;&gt;168&lt;/a&gt; Now New Jersey corporations could own corporations in another state, without having to force the other states’ corporations to become New Jersey corporations. A New Jersey corporation could own them without having to legally terminate them – meaning corporations wanting to merge or combine operations so as to achieve economies of scale and scope, didn’t have to break state law. They had contracted a new economic freedom, and the states had lost their opportunity to undo acquisitions by foreign corporations – by 1894, 280 of the largest corporations in America were organized under New Jersey law.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc169&quot; href=&quot;#fn169&quot;&gt;169&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected benefit of using corporations, not trusts, to organize industrial activity, was the use of stock certificates rather than trust certificates, to evidence ownership. Limited public trading of trust certificates had begun, but uncertainties regarding the rights of holders of trust certificates restrained their trade. Stock certificates, on the other hand, were already accepted as a tradable security, with investors practiced at buying and selling railroad and utility stock certificates. With the ever increasing number of corporations issuing stock certificates to buy other industrial corporations, trading of stock certificates expanded rapidly. New certificate holders, many of whom were individuals who really wanted cash, were very willing, even aggressive, sellers of their certificates, thus generating stock trading activity. (In addition, the 1880’s saw a large number of firms that had formed during the 1870’s wanting to transfer ownership.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc170&quot; href=&quot;#fn170&quot;&gt;170&lt;/a&gt; Many of these stocks first traded on the sidewalksoutside the listed exchanges, principally in New York and Boston, in what were known as “curb” markets – transitional between the traditional personal markets for stock certificates and the impersonal markets of the listed exchanges.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc171&quot; href=&quot;#fn171&quot;&gt;171&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders benefited from corporations “going public,” and to a lesser extent from being traded in the curb markets, because the price of the shares they held significantly increased, often more than doubling – just because of being publicly traded publicly. That meant corporation capitalization’s were calculated as seven-to-ten times earnings instead of three times.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc172&quot; href=&quot;#fn172&quot;&gt;172&lt;/a&gt; In essence, buyers were willing to pay a much higher price per share, if they had the right to sell the stock at any time, and better yet, at any time and at fair market price. This phenomenon was a direct consequence of the rapid expansion in the numbers of shareholders of public companies, shareholders that held far too few shares of stock to have any influence on management. Since these growing legions of shareholders could not evidence their displeasure with management directly, the only recourse they had was to sell their stock – an option only if sufficient stock traded so they could sell at market prices. (The institution of public capital markets for industrial securities emerged initially, therefore, in response to sellers of stock. Over time, as the volume of buyers and sellers grew, and the high valuations buyers were prepared to put on traded corporations persisted, a venue for the direct sale of stock by industrial corporations developed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that some shareholders wanted safe returns while others wanted to speculate, industrial corporations began using a technique perfected in railroad financing, but never before used with industrial corporations. Rather than issuing just “common stock,” industrial corporations issued both common and “preferred stock.” The preferred stock paid a stated dividend and derived value from having senior rights to the corporation’s assets in cases of bankruptcy. Common stock, on the other hand, although having a par, or stated, value, was priced by the market dynamics of buyers and sellers as a multiple of earnings, not a percentage of asset values. The preferred appealed to the conservative investor, the common to those wanting to speculate. The preferred also held advantage for the existing common shareholders, for preferred stock did not have voting rights. It had all the advantages of converting asset values into cash without entailing any dilution of control to existing shareholders – especially agency control. As a bonus, simply splitting the two forms of value, asset value and market value, led to increases in valuation of the combined stocks of corporations’ by 40 percent&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc173&quot; href=&quot;#fn173&quot;&gt;173&lt;/a&gt; – roughly the same mark-up as the Standard Oil Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 1893, just as it seemed as though industrial corporations had been given the green light to expand nationally by New Jersey, the means for small new shareholders to buy and sell their stock in curb and public capital markets, and the protections of the Constitution as persons, the economic recovery collapsed. In the early months of that year, a growing number of mercantile failures raised concerns with whether the government had enough gold to honor its credit obligations. It made for uneasy conditions. Then in May, National Cordage, a very prominent industrial corporation with publicly-traded preferred stock, filed for bankruptcy. The markets staged a one day retreat, and a bear market had begun. Then came July 26, 1893, known as “Black Wednesday.” Industrial stocks began posting daily lows,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc174&quot; href=&quot;#fn174&quot;&gt;174&lt;/a&gt; ending any market for industrial stocks. The next four years (1893-1897) would become known as the first industrial depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When recovery began, in 1897, so did the radical transformation of the industrial economy. To that it is agreed. But why is not. Prices certainly had something to do with it. The period of 1893 to 1895 represents the lingering low in the thirty year fall in prices of 36%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc175&quot; href=&quot;#fn175&quot;&gt;175&lt;/a&gt; Business were being packed together ever tighter, while at the same time, many were trying to expand operations. At some point, the logic goes, the pain of competing would lead to horizontal combinations – mergers among businesses that were directly competitive. It would also lead to other firms combining vertically, either forward or backward, to capture economies of operational efficiencies, not just the economies of doing more of the same. But business combinations were exactly why Congress had passed the Sherman Antitrust Act – to stop corporations from becoming big and monopolistic – the intended, and consequential, results of horizontal and vertical mergers of corporations. A new logic of market competition was needed to justify Big Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems of declining prices and recurring recessions were also thought to be a result of overproduction.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc176&quot; href=&quot;#fn176&quot;&gt;176&lt;/a&gt; Overproduction was a new phenomenon, and ran deeply counter to the principles of market competition of Adam Smith. In natural liberty, supply and demand remained ever in balance – that is overproduction did not persist. But the agricultural world of Smith, and by historical extension, the many small producers of competitive capitalism were losing their grip on the economy. Instead, ever larger corporations were becoming dominant. One way to stem overproduction, it was argued, was to consolidate production in a few firms that would be able to constrain production, raise prices, and restore orderly market conditions. These were economic changes competitive capitalism was meant to resist, not foster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source of stresses on corporations were conflicts with labor.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc177&quot; href=&quot;#fn177&quot;&gt;177&lt;/a&gt; Wages in industry had increased by 70% since 1860&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc178&quot; href=&quot;#fn178&quot;&gt;178&lt;/a&gt; while prices had declined; thus the purchasing power of wages grew even faster than wages. These higher wages would not have squeezed profits if labor productivity had risen yet faster, but it had not. For the decade 1884 to 1894, wages grew five to six times faster than productivity.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc179&quot; href=&quot;#fn179&quot;&gt;179&lt;/a&gt; Little wonder then that labor strikes were on the increase as labor sought higher wages and corporations were without the means to pay them. Between 1890-1893, there were 6,153 strikes, up 27% over 1886-1889. (Strikes dropped to 4,668 during the depression years of 1894-1897.) The new technologies of manufacture, and the obvious need to convert factory equipment and operations to electricity, were ending the days when a crafts philosophy could dictate the nature of production. Labor had to be contracted for and managed very differently if the required capital investments in production were to prove profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much as Adam Smith had provided a new vision of economic growth to replace mercantilism, another new vision was needed to understand ever lower prices and the rise of large corporate enterprises. The vision came in Alfred Marshall’s Principles of Economics (1890) which owes much to William S. Jevons Theory of Political Economy (1871).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc180&quot; href=&quot;#fn180&quot;&gt;180&lt;/a&gt; Both dealt with the problem of prices by introducing the concept of marginalism. To achieve low prices required large-scale operations with attendant high sales volumes, volumes large enough to generate margin to cover all fixed costs. Subsequent sales, marginal sales, then had to cover only their variable costs, hence prices could drop appreciably. If sufficient sales did not exist to support as many corporations as wanted to compete, scarcity-induced competition would winnow them down. Some markets might sustain a competitive number of firms for a long time. Most markets, however, seemed to sustain only a few firms – oligopolies. Marginalism provided the economic logic to explain why Big Businesses benefited the public good. A new logic of competition, one justifying large corporations, could replace the supremacy of forced competition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc181&quot; href=&quot;#fn181&quot;&gt;181&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1895, amidst recession and economic doubts, the Supreme Court made a statement as only it could do. This time the landmark United States v. E. C. Knight Company, an early lawsuit filed under the Sherman Act.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc182&quot; href=&quot;#fn182&quot;&gt;182&lt;/a&gt; The Court ruled that the Sherman Act did not apply to manufacturing, but only to trade – “commerce succeeds to manufacturing and is no part of it.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc183&quot; href=&quot;#fn183&quot;&gt;183&lt;/a&gt; Product has to be made before it can be sold. Commerce is the selling, province of Congress. Making product comes under state authority. The Court reaffirmed the states’, not Federal authority, rights to police corporation governance and regulate the structure of industrial corporations. A monopoly through manufacturing, even though a restraint of trade, was for the states to prosecute, not the Federal government – even when American Sugar Refining Corporation, the merger of six state-based corporations, controlled 98% of the sugar business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1896, New Jersey again liberalized their incorporation laws. The general Revision Act essentially ended state control of corporations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc184&quot; href=&quot;#fn184&quot;&gt;184&lt;/a&gt; New Jersey had given away almost all state governance power, and the Courts had circumscribed state power over both commerce and contracts. For the moment, industrial corporations seemed to be free to do what they wanted, immune to either public interest regulation or antitrust legislation. It was as if they had been given the green light to expand wherever they wanted. Reflective of the privileges and immunities in the New Jersey law, 834 charters were granted in 1896, generating nearly $800,000 in filing fees and franchise taxes.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc185&quot; href=&quot;#fn185&quot;&gt;185&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication technologies played a subtle yet significant role in the Second Industrial Revolution which is instructive for the rest of this study. For without the telephone, and the growing ability to connect to anyone else, the transacting of business through first markets, and then within corporations, would have been severely constrained. In 1893 and 1894, the basic patents for the telephone expired. Competition emerged immediately. In 1895, there were 199 new entrants, in 1900, 508. (See Exhibit 2.7 Telephone Statistics)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-27-telephone-statistics&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.7 Telephone Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

Yearly telephone rentals of $5.74 in 1893 plunged to $1.45 in 1898. The effect on calls per day was equally dramatic. (See Exhibit 2.8 Growth Rate in Calls Per Day) Calls per day growth up to 1900 can be viewed as communication activity among separate firms trying to conduct business. The precipitous drop between 1900 and 1903 reflects the shift of communication coordination among firms, the market, to within organizations by way of company-based PBX systems. Corporations could consolidate into Big Businesses because the communication technologies made it possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-28-growth-rate-in-calls-per-day&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.8 Growth Rate in Calls Per Day&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-8-growth-rate-in-calls-per-day.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.8 Growth Rate in Calls Per Day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of Who controlled the nation’s industrial structure? loomed large in the presidential election of 1896. William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic candidate, advocated Federal licensing of corporations combined with strong state controls over corporate capitalization and business practices – monopolies would not be allowed. Believing the Supreme Court an accomplice in the rise of Big Business, he argued for a Constitutional amendment giving Congress broader powers to police corporations, and proposed a number of measures to reign in the Supreme Court.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc186&quot; href=&quot;#fn186&quot;&gt;186&lt;/a&gt; The Republicans led by William McKinley campaigned against Bryan’s reckless notions to combat corporate growth, and his “free-silver” advocacy, and in the end pulled out the victory.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc187&quot; href=&quot;#fn187&quot;&gt;187&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further evidence of the profound shift in society’s acceptance of corporations and their freedom to act was another Supreme Court decision. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana (1897), the Court affirmed the liberty of contract by voiding a state law affecting contractual “property” rights.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc188&quot; href=&quot;#fn188&quot;&gt;188&lt;/a&gt; It seemed as long as corporations did not engage in fraudulent acts, they were free to make whatever contractual arrangements they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-1897, the depression had run its course. As the stock market began to reflect growing confidence in the economy, investors, no longer enamored with the railroads, found they had a new alternative in which to invest – industrial stocks. During the past four years, industrial stocks had performed almost as well as the best railroad stocks, and better than most of them – more than 25% of the railroads by capitalization (and more than 40% by mileage) had gone into receivership.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc189&quot; href=&quot;#fn189&quot;&gt;189&lt;/a&gt; During these same four years, the number of publicly-quoted and traded industrial stocks had grown from 30 to 200.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc190&quot; href=&quot;#fn190&quot;&gt;190&lt;/a&gt; Doubts as to the investment quality of industrial stocks appeared unfounded – doubts that had stymied marketing of industrial stock certificates but five years earlier. Furthermore, the railroads ceased being large consumers of capital; from year end 1896 to 1904, railroads paid $50 million more in dividends than was the increase in their outstanding common and preferred stock&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc191&quot; href=&quot;#fn191&quot;&gt;191&lt;/a&gt; – in contrast to consuming hundreds of millions of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1897, industrial stocks were poised to explode. Marginalism had shown the way – get Big. The promise of industrial success to those consolidating industry production provided all the justification needed to view speculation in asset values as wise investment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc192&quot; href=&quot;#fn192&quot;&gt;192&lt;/a&gt; No one had any idea what the coming together of economic logic, investment justification, institutional freedoms, and pent up economic potential would mean. In 1897, there were only 8 industrial companies with capitalization’s greater than $50 million – by 1900 there would be 40, and then on to many more. Over the next four years, 1898 to 1902, the value of corporate consolidations totaled 53% of the book value of all manufacturing and mining corporations – $6.3 billion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc193&quot; href=&quot;#fn193&quot;&gt;193&lt;/a&gt; Major merger announcements seemed to happen monthly. By 1903, 2,216 manufacturing plants came under the control of 185 firms.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc194&quot; href=&quot;#fn194&quot;&gt;194&lt;/a&gt; By 1904, more than 3,000 firms disappeared.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc195&quot; href=&quot;#fn195&quot;&gt;195&lt;/a&gt; Emerging to exercise owner control over these new independent, agency managed, trusts and corporations were investment bankers who dominated the Boards of Directors. Also facilitating this profound change in industrial America between 1897 and 1914, were unprecedented price increases of 40 to 50 percent, an abrupt change from the declining prices of the preceding twenty years, and unique in industrial history.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc196&quot; href=&quot;#fn196&quot;&gt;196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1898, the prestigious financial firm of J. P. Morgan and Company (known as the “House of Morgan”), the leading underwriter of railroad securities, and headed by J. Pierpont Morgan,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc197&quot; href=&quot;#fn197&quot;&gt;197&lt;/a&gt; the most powerful investment banker, i.e. capitalist, of his day, added their approval to the consolidation of industry when they floated the new issue of Federal Steel. Federal Steel was the coming together of thirteen companies and was capitalized at $200 million&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc198&quot; href=&quot;#fn198&quot;&gt;198&lt;/a&gt; – gigantic for the time. In bringing Federal Steel public, Morgan instituted a new practice that would become universally adopted. Rather than stripping the entities of cash, Morgan made sure Federal Steel had excess cash to finance future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress, under pressure to do something about the tide of new large corporations, created the Industrial Commission to “investigate various industrial problems, including corporation evils and the trusts.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc199&quot; href=&quot;#fn199&quot;&gt;199&lt;/a&gt; The Commission recommended a federal agency be formed to publicize improper practices of corporations, hoping that adverse publicity would act as a deterrent. Congress came off as feeble, not for lack of power, but from not knowing what to do, as well as the paralysis that comes from questioning whether anything really needed to be done or not. The depression of 1893-1897 had been devastating, an experience no one ever wanted to reoccur. Large corporations and trusts might be introducing new problems, but they seemed to be pulling the economy out of its lethargy, and to most that was very welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1898 as well, the Supreme Court enumerated what a legal combination was in their decision of Joint Traffic v. United States. The following transactions were not contracts in restraint of trade: “(1) “the formation of a corporation to carry on any particular line of business”; (2) “a contract of partnership”; (3) “the appointment by two producers of the same person to sell their goods on commission”; (4) “the purchase by one wholesale merchant of the product of two producers”; (5) “the lease or purchase by a farmer, manufacturer or merchant of an additional farm, manufactory or shop.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc200&quot; href=&quot;#fn200&quot;&gt;200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market soared 40% in 1899. In the first quarter, new industrial corporations with a capitalized value of $1.59 billion were created – automobile consolidations alone raised $338 million from sale of stock.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc201&quot; href=&quot;#fn201&quot;&gt;201&lt;/a&gt; It was unprecedented. Even when a break in the market late in the year led to the bankruptcies of several brokerages, and a panic seemed imminent, Morgan announced he would lend one million dollars on favorable terms to troubled firms and would raise another $9 million if needed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc202&quot; href=&quot;#fn202&quot;&gt;202&lt;/a&gt; The bull market acted as if it had breathed pure oxygen and charged ahead. For the year, new industrial corporations totaling $3.59 billion of capitalized value were created. All these consolidations resulted in a half a million people owning shares of stock in public corporations by 1900.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc203&quot; href=&quot;#fn203&quot;&gt;203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief story from those turbulent, optimistic times gives an idea of the economic energy being released:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When one of the smaller “trusts” was being formed, a party of steel men were on their way to Chicago one night after a buying tour. The men had been drinking and were in a convivial mood. Said one, “There’s a steel mill at the next station: let’s get out and buy it.” “Agreed!”It was past midnight when they reached the station, but they pulled the plant owner out of bed and demanded that he sell his plant.“My plant is worth two hundred thousand dollars, but it is not for sale,” was the reply.“Never mind about the price,” answered the hilarious purchasers, “we will give you three hundred thousand – five hundred thousand.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc204&quot; href=&quot;#fn204&quot;&gt;204&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;J. Pierpont Morgan had visions of not simply organizing a few factories, but of restructuring entire industries. In 1901, he led the formation and public flotation of U.S. Steel with a capitalized value of $1.4 billion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc205&quot; href=&quot;#fn205&quot;&gt;205&lt;/a&gt; It represented the consolidation of eleven major firms that had once been 170 separate companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc206&quot; href=&quot;#fn206&quot;&gt;206&lt;/a&gt; Said another way, it represented “213 different manufacturing plants and transportation companies, 41 mines, 1,000 miles of private railroad lines, 112 ore vessels, 78 blast furnaces and the world’s largest coke, coal and ore holdings.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc207&quot; href=&quot;#fn207&quot;&gt;207&lt;/a&gt; The capitalization consisted of $300 million in bonds, the rest being common and preferred stock. Since the assets of the combined companies only totalled $682 million, the balance, $718 million, was sold as the value of future earnings. To the skeptical, it represented yet another example of watered stock.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc208&quot; href=&quot;#fn208&quot;&gt;208&lt;/a&gt; The U.S. Steel transaction accounted for 26% of the capitalized value of all mergers from 1895 to 1904,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc209&quot; href=&quot;#fn209&quot;&gt;209&lt;/a&gt; and represented nearly one quarter of the gross national product of the United States in 1901.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc210&quot; href=&quot;#fn210&quot;&gt;210&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1901, New Jersey had become home for 95% of the nation’s major businesses, including Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and American Sugar Refining Corporation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc211&quot; href=&quot;#fn211&quot;&gt;211&lt;/a&gt; By 1902, the state debt had been paid off and property taxes had been abolished. Three years later, New Jersey had a surplus of nearly three million dollars in its treasury, and the governor proclaimed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the entire income of the government, not a penny was contributed directly by the people…The state is caring for the blind, the feeble-minded, and the insane, supporting our prisoners and reformatories, educating the younger generation, developing a magnificent road system, maintaining the state governments and courts of justice, all of which would be a burden upon the taxpayer except for our present fiscal policy.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc212&quot; href=&quot;#fn212&quot;&gt;212&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States when President William McKinley was assassinated. He thought the consolidation of corporate power had gone to far. In his first address to Congress in December, he stated: “In the interest of the whole people, the Nation should, without interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc213&quot; href=&quot;#fn213&quot;&gt;213&lt;/a&gt; It wasn’t as though Roosevelt was anti-business, he accepted the growth of large corporations to be the natural consequence of industrial development, he did however object to “bad” trusts in contrast to “good” trusts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc214&quot; href=&quot;#fn214&quot;&gt;214&lt;/a&gt; The Roosevelt Administration filed forty-four lawsuits under the Sherman Act, with twenty-two convictions and twenty-two acquittals. (The Taft Administration, 1909-1912, would file ninety Sherman Act lawsuits and win fifty-five convictions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1902, the states made it clear they simply were not going to act to control large corporations. At the annual meeting of the State Boards of Commissioners for Promoting Uniformity of Legislation, the states abandoned their efforts of the past decade to find common uniform laws they all would adopt. In frustration, the President of the association announced: “It is useless to attempt to secure the adoption of a Uniform Incorporation Act by the various States because the trend of legislation in too many of the States is to enact laws favoring incorporation with a view to pecuniary returns to the State rather than with a view to adherence to sound principles.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc215&quot; href=&quot;#fn215&quot;&gt;215&lt;/a&gt; Further evidence corporations now had the upper hand was a report of the Massachusetts Committee on Corporation Law in 1902 that held: “ordinary business corporation[s] should be allowed to do anything that an individual may do.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc216&quot; href=&quot;#fn216&quot;&gt;216&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same year, Roosevelt, more certain than ever of the need for Federal action called for a federal law of incorporation and the creation of a Department of Commerce. Congress denied him an incorporation law, but did authorize a Department of Commerce and Labor. In 1903, a wary Congress authorized a Bureau of Corporations to investigate bad businesses. It also passed the Expediting Act that gave priority in the federal courts to cases arising under the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Act. Since their passage, both acts had been weakened by court decisions and the ability of offending corporations to stall any decisions by legal delaying tactics. And Congress passed the Elkins Act of 1903 that forbade railroads from giving rebates to large corporations. The Federal government struggled to find a means to stem the perceived power of corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 14, 1904, the Supreme Court in Northern Securities Co. v. United States ordered the dissolution of Northern Securities, the merger of “parallel and competing lines across the continent through the northern tier of states.” It signaled that the Supreme Court was willing to employ the powers of the Sherman Act to undo restraining combinations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc217&quot; href=&quot;#fn217&quot;&gt;217&lt;/a&gt; It gave but brief pause to the bull market and merger mania, before the irrepressible consolidations continued. The Northern Securities decision did have the effect, however, of ending calls for a constitutional amendment to deal with the trust problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1905, Roosevelt told Congress: “experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state action. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectually exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the work of the corporations – that is, by national government.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc218&quot; href=&quot;#fn218&quot;&gt;218&lt;/a&gt; In 1906, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Hepburn Act. It greatly strengthened the powers of the ICC, including the authority to mandate uniform accounting standards – the first time ever.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc219&quot; href=&quot;#fn219&quot;&gt;219&lt;/a&gt; The Justice Department acted as well, filing a lawsuit against Standard Oil for violations under the Sherman Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1907, financial panic ended the ten year binge of markets and corporate consolidations. In the process, industrial America had been transformed. Seventy-eight industries were now dominated by firms with more that 50% market share; in twenty-six of them, firms held market shares of more than 80%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc220&quot; href=&quot;#fn220&quot;&gt;220&lt;/a&gt; (There were 171 industries for which information was available;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc221&quot; href=&quot;#fn221&quot;&gt;221&lt;/a&gt; suggesting than 46% of American industry was under the control of tight oligopolies.) In 1900, a total of 149 trusts had capitalized values of $4 billion, by 1909 there were 10,020 trusts with a capitalized value of $31 billion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc222&quot; href=&quot;#fn222&quot;&gt;222&lt;/a&gt; (To jump ahead for a moment, these consolidations did not prove permanent; although the dominance of large corporations did persist. (See Exhibit 2.9 Market Shares of Selected Turn-of-the-Century Combinations))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The historic drive to industry consolidation, Big Business, may have been slowed, but not so for Big Government. In 1910, Congress acted again to strengthen the ICC by passing the Elkins-Mann Act. Its provisions made clear that “the ICC was not simply a court nor a branch of the executive but rather a committee, or arm of Congress.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc223&quot; href=&quot;#fn223&quot;&gt;223&lt;/a&gt; The ICC also assumed jurisdiction of the telegraph, telephone, and cable industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-29-market-shares-of-selected-turn-of-the-century-combinations&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.9 Market Shares of Selected Turn-of-the-Century Combinations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

Standard Oil and American Tobacco were ordered to dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1914, President Woodrow Wilson delivered his “Trusts and Monopolies” speech to Congress: “I am for big business and I am against the trusts.” Within the year, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act as well as the Clayton Act. The Federal Trade Commission assumed the responsibilities of the Bureau of Corporations and was to provide continuous supervision of competition so as to protect small businesses and keep markets open to new competition. The Clayton Act supplemented the Sherman Act by condemning: “(a) price discriminations, (b) exclusive and tying contracts, (c) intercorporate stockholding, particularly by holding companies and (d) interlocking directorates where the effect of these practices by be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create monopolies.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc224&quot; href=&quot;#fn224&quot;&gt;224&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the world plunged into World War I. No longer was the concern of the Federal Government competition, but cooperation, as it needed businesses to supply the products to fight a war. The large corporations of oligopolistic market-structures proved equal to the tasks, and as they won praise for their production prowness, for providing the arms and goods to defend the free world, fears of monopolistic powers subsided, and American settled into its new economic order of corporate capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate capitalism had supplanted competitive capitalism for reasons reminiscent of the why the Constitution had replaced the Articles of Confederation – economic order and growth was no longer possible under the prior conditions as crises compounded crises. The rich bounty of America’s unspoiled natural resources, combined with rapid population growth, created economic opportunities too large and attractive to be contained within the small, state-based businesses of competitive capitalism. As the technologies of transportation and communication integrated markets, and the technologies of manufacturing drove scale and scope, new, larger economic entities were needed, and being made possible by new technologies and the evolving institutions of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now time to look more closely at the seminal technology of the telephone, and how its history was impacted by the larger changes described above. Corporate capitalism would not have been possible without the telephone, and the telephone would not have prospered as it did without large corporations. Invented amidst the crisis of competitive capitalism, the telephone grew mature by World War I. Its transformation from the intellectual property of patents, to the private property of a large, publicly-traded corporation, happened simultaneously with corporate capitalism’s emergence and dominance, and thus offers a unique opportunity to observe how corporations reflect the larger forces that operate around them. For example, just as corporate capitalism had to respond to the rise of Federal regulation and antitrust policy, so did AT&amp;amp;T; only AT&amp;amp;T used these institutions to lock in and sustain its monopolistic powers, not be torn down by them. (See Appendix 2.2 Emergence of Corporate Capitalism and AT&amp;amp;T ) Yet during the processes of its self-organization, AT&amp;amp;T seeded structural inertias that eventually became its undoing; a story that will also be told. The principles being explored will be explicated in future chapters, and shown to function over the life cycles of every successful corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But enough, now to return to the depression of the 1870’s, the eve of the crisis of competitive capitalism, and the story of Alexander Graham Bell, the telephone, and AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) grew up under three strong influences. First there was Edinburgh, a city alive with a renaissance of scientific and technological progress.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc225&quot; href=&quot;#fn225&quot;&gt;225&lt;/a&gt; Graham&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc226&quot; href=&quot;#fn226&quot;&gt;226&lt;/a&gt; would forever be the mechanic, the tinkerer, the believer in man’s ability to understand and shape nature. Next was the Scottish-Calvinist moral philosophy that taught hard work brought its own reward. Graham was intense at work, not for money, but because it was in him. Third was his family, especially the consequences of its tradition of service for deaf-mutes. Graham too would became an elocutionist as had his father and his father’s father. All this was in the character of Graham when, at the age of eighteen, he left for England to study and teach elocution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, Graham met Alexander J. Ellis, president of the London Philological Society, and translator of Hermann von Helmholtz’s On the Sensations of Tone. Ellis repeated Helmholtz’s experiment of vibrating tuning forks with electro-magnets and electrified wires. To Graham, it was like magic and inspired images of a musical telegraph. His ignorance of telegraphy, rather than discourage him, motivated his self-education. In 1869, he met Sir Charles Wheatstone, England’s Samuel Morse. Sir Wheatstone, fifty years his elder and an expert in telegraphy, inspired in Graham the nobleness of invention, an attitude he maintained, even in his darkest days, of which there would be many before discovering how to propagate human voice through a metal wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham moved with his family to Brantford, Ontario, Canada, after the death of his second brother from tuberculosis. Also of weak constitution, after resting and regaining his strength, Graham and his father began giving lectures throughout eastern Canada and the United States on a technique developed by his father known as Visible Speech – a technique for visualizing and replicating any speech or language. Hearing of Graham’s success with deaf-mutes, the Boston Board of Education offered him five hundred dollars to practice in Boston, and in April 1871&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc227&quot; href=&quot;#fn227&quot;&gt;227&lt;/a&gt; , Graham left for the country that would in a year become his new home.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc228&quot; href=&quot;#fn228&quot;&gt;228&lt;/a&gt; Boston, as had been his childhood Edinburgh, was alive with entrepreneurial and inventive energy, an ideal environment for a motivated young inventor. But first came serving as Professor of vocal physiology at the Boston School of Oratory.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc229&quot; href=&quot;#fn229&quot;&gt;229&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long Graham began experimenting to invent a musical telegraph – also known as a harmonic telegraph. The objective was not to propagate music, but to send and receive Morse codes on multiple tones at the same time.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc230&quot; href=&quot;#fn230&quot;&gt;230&lt;/a&gt; If made to work, it was a sure sale to Western Union Telegraph Company (WU), as it would significantly increase the message traffic a telegraph wire could support&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc231&quot; href=&quot;#fn231&quot;&gt;231&lt;/a&gt; He knew others had the same idea, especially the famed inventor Elisha Gray. In 1873, Graham had to begin tutoring private students to supplement his meager income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the summer of 1874, Graham experimented with skeletal bones from a human ear. He marveled at the ability of the small membrane to transmit sound through the much larger bones. It seeded the seminal idea of a membrane, with a small piece of metal inducing sounds in much larger piece of metal, such as a long wire. Both essential insights to his yet defined objective of a telegraph that could transmit human speech. That Fall, Graham began his long and productive association with Thomas Watson, at the time an employee of Charles William Jr.’s Telegraphic instrument manufacturing company. (Even Thomas Edison once worked there.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of Graham’s students then proved catalytic. Their fathers, on learning of Bell’s efforts to invent telegraph patents, provided him capital in exchange for a share in the rewards of patent successes. Thomas Sanders&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc232&quot; href=&quot;#fn232&quot;&gt;232&lt;/a&gt; would become the shallow-pocket venture capitalist; for two years he also provided room and board and the use of his basement as a laboratory. Gardiner G. Hubbard, the very same who had lobbied Congress for a national charter to compete with WU, came a few months later. Hubbard, a lawyer, became the business leader. He was also the essential link to Washington, just as Fog Smith had been for Samuel Morse.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc233&quot; href=&quot;#fn233&quot;&gt;233&lt;/a&gt; A collective of three now existed – one inventing, and two standing ready to commercialize successful patents – presumably by selling them to WU. On February 27, 1875, the collective signed an agreement that has become known as the Bell Patent Association – it really had no name existing only as a contract. Graham, Hubbard and Sanders each held third interests. (In September 1876, Watson would be granted ten percent.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this same time that Graham confided to Watson:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Watson, I have another idea I haven’t told you about that I think will surprise you. If I can get a mechanism which will make a current of electricity vary in its intensity as the air varies in density when a sound is passing through it, I can telegraph any sound, even the sound of speech.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc234&quot; href=&quot;#fn234&quot;&gt;234&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham, as a consequence of his father’s Visible Speech, literally saw speech moving through wire – undulations – as it would through the air. This perspective was unique among the inventors of the time, and proved crucial. When Graham told Hubbard and Sanders his idea of transmitting speech, they responded in the strongest terms against wasting time on what they thought was but a toy. Telegraphic inventions were where the money was to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, looking for moral support as much as technical guidance, Graham called on Joesph Henry, America’s leading scientist, inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph and secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D. C.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc235&quot; href=&quot;#fn235&quot;&gt;235&lt;/a&gt; On telling Henry of his ideas for transmitting human voice and demonstrating an early prototype, Henry told him he had the germ of a great invention. When Graham confided he lacked the needed understanding of electricity, Henry’s long remembered, and inspiring, response was GET IT.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc236&quot; href=&quot;#fn236&quot;&gt;236&lt;/a&gt; (Just as Morse had to.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham began working ever longer hours, neglecting his tutoring and teaching. On June 2 and 3, 1875, he and Watson transmitted speech sounds – not intelligible words, just sounds – and without using a battery.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc237&quot; href=&quot;#fn237&quot;&gt;237&lt;/a&gt; They burst into joy and their celebrated war dance, certain they were on the right path. Graham in a letter to Hubbard of June 2 wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Hubbard, – I have accidentally made a discovery of the very greatest importance in regard to the Transmitting Instruments……..I have succeeded to-day in transmitting signals without any battery whatever!&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc238&quot; href=&quot;#fn238&quot;&gt;238&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That September Graham began writing what would become the patent for the telephone, or, as it was known at the time, the “speaking telegraph.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc239&quot; href=&quot;#fn239&quot;&gt;239&lt;/a&gt; Not until February 14, 1876, however, did Hubbard file Graham’s patent for reasons of money and the strategy to file for foreign patents at the same time. The critical last phrase reads:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically….by causing electrical undulation, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc240&quot; href=&quot;#fn240&quot;&gt;240&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No where is there the mention of speech. Two hours later, Elisha Gray filed a caveat&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc241&quot; href=&quot;#fn241&quot;&gt;241&lt;/a&gt; – a declaration of having invented but not yet having a working prototype. It read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I..have invented a new art of transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically of which the following is a specification. It is the object of my invention to transmit the tones of the human voice through a telegraphic circuit, and reproduce them at the receiving end of the line, so that actual conversations can be carried on by persons at long distances apart.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc242&quot; href=&quot;#fn242&quot;&gt;242&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Graham’s twenty-ninth birthday, March 3, 1876, his invention was allowed as U. S. Patent No. 174,465 – arguably the most important patent ever recorded. On March 7th, it was issued. On March 10, late at night, testing a new transmitter design – the liquid transmitter&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc243&quot; href=&quot;#fn243&quot;&gt;243&lt;/a&gt; – Graham, spilled some of the liquid acid on himself and shouted – “Mr. Watson, come here; I want you”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc244&quot; href=&quot;#fn244&quot;&gt;244&lt;/a&gt; – and Watson, down the hall in another room, heard him over yet another of their strange telegraphs”. The telephone had been invented.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc245&quot; href=&quot;#fn245&quot;&gt;245&lt;/a&gt; Graham’s patent would make for a generation of patent lawyers, for from 1878 to 1888, when the Supreme Court ruled on five appealed cases Graham’s patent legal, Bell had to file over six hundred lawsuits. In every one, Graham’s right to the patent was affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first working telephone – the gallows&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc246&quot; href=&quot;#fn246&quot;&gt;246&lt;/a&gt; after its wooden casing – was crude compared to a modern telephone. For example, the transmitter and receiver were the same, with users having to shout against a metal membrane to speak, and then press their ear against the same metal disk to hear – only pressing just right for it even to work. It was one way, taking awkward and mutually coordinated gymnastics to carry on a conversation. The first two-way communication would not occur until October 9.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc247&quot; href=&quot;#fn247&quot;&gt;247&lt;/a&gt; The gallows was also strictly local. Not until November 26 would conversation be sustained at the distance of sixteen miles.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc248&quot; href=&quot;#fn248&quot;&gt;248&lt;/a&gt; And then there was the quality, or more accurately, the lack of quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, what a marvel – voice traveling through metal. Graham and his friends began to spread their news, hoping to create excitement for their invention. On May 10, 1876, Graham lectured and demonstrated his speaking telegraph to the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences in Boston.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc249&quot; href=&quot;#fn249&quot;&gt;249&lt;/a&gt; Two weeks later he did so for the Society of Arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Hubbard, a Commissioner of the upcoming grand Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, then arranged for Graham’s toy to be displayed on a small table of the Department of Education. There it sat, unnoticed and ignored for weeks, until Sunday June 25,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc250&quot; href=&quot;#fn250&quot;&gt;250&lt;/a&gt; when, at the end of a long hot day, the fifty or so judges approached to inspect yet another entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centennial Exposition was staged deliberately in Philadelphia – the birthplace of the proud country’s founding documents: the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc251&quot; href=&quot;#fn251&quot;&gt;251&lt;/a&gt; In the Machinery Hall were displayed the most innovative applications of steam power and electricity&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc252&quot; href=&quot;#fn252&quot;&gt;252&lt;/a&gt; – to highlight the state, and future, of science and industry. But to the judges standing before the speaking telegraph, thoughts of dinner and the evening ahead were more important than understanding yet another mystifying object. Having already seen the stars of the show – Edison’s first electric light, Gray’s musical telegraph, the first grain-binder, and an impressive exhibit of printing telegraphs from WU&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc253&quot; href=&quot;#fn253&quot;&gt;253&lt;/a&gt; – the judges were more than prepared to give brief look at Graham’s toy. And then in a drama only history could stage, the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro de Alcantara, stepped forward: Professor Bell, I am delighted to see you again.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc254&quot; href=&quot;#fn254&quot;&gt;254&lt;/a&gt; The Emperor, a fellow advocate for the deaf-mute, had visited a class of Graham’s in Boston, and was now ready to experience the speaking telegraph. On demonstration, he exclaimed: My God – it talks! Next came Henry, who had encouraged Graham with his brief Get It: This comes nearer to overthrowing the doctrine of the conservation of energy than anything I ever saw. Then Sir William Thomson, the future Lord Kelvin, the foremost electrical scientist of the day: It does speak. It is the most wonderful thing I have seen in America.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc255&quot; href=&quot;#fn255&quot;&gt;255&lt;/a&gt; The next day it was moved to the head table and became the great Yankee invention.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc256&quot; href=&quot;#fn256&quot;&gt;256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not until the “apparatus” – the sender/receiver – was perfected would more than a suggestive prototype exist. So back to the laboratory attic went Graham and Watson. On January 15, 1877, Bell filed his apparatus patent. On January 30, 1877, U.S. Patent No. 186,787 was issued. By yelling loudly into it, one could be heard as far as twenty miles away.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc257&quot; href=&quot;#fn257&quot;&gt;257&lt;/a&gt; (For a brief non-technical discussion see Appendix 2.3 How the Telephone Works.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having in hand the necessary patents for a telephone, Hubbard tried to sell them to WU – the price: $100,000; roughly $2.8 million in 1988 dollars.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc258&quot; href=&quot;#fn258&quot;&gt;258&lt;/a&gt; The telephone was neither new, nor uninteresting, to WU executives having tracked telephony developments from as early as July 1875.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc259&quot; href=&quot;#fn259&quot;&gt;259&lt;/a&gt; Even so, they placed little, if any, value in what they saw or learned from Hubbard, believing as was custom that businessmen would want a written record of any communications, and its customers were businesses. More than likely Hubbard’s involvement was a negative, because he had caused WU so much grief in 1873 when he tried to garner Congressional support to start a competitor. For whatever reasons, WU turned Hubbard down. They then signed an invention agreement with Thomas Alva Edison, the foremost inventor of the time, to invent a better transmitter.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc260&quot; href=&quot;#fn260&quot;&gt;260&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cold reality of rejection then hit them. If they – Graham, Hubbard, Sanders and Watson – did not develop the market for telephones, it was unlikely anyone else would, and their patents would lapse into worthlessness. Graham’s vision that one day “a telephone in every house would be considered indispensable”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc261&quot; href=&quot;#fn261&quot;&gt;261&lt;/a&gt; painted too attractive an economic opportunity to abandon. So they decided to launch the business on their own – to become entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell and Watson started giving lectures with demonstrations&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc262&quot; href=&quot;#fn262&quot;&gt;262&lt;/a&gt; to promote the telephone, and, hopefully, to find investors to finance the large company thought necessary. Press they got – iron circuits were described as one day connecting the nation together.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc263&quot; href=&quot;#fn263&quot;&gt;263&lt;/a&gt; Dollars they did not. Sanders continued to contribute cash as he could, but his resources were already stretched thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among their earliest decisions was: How were they going to sell and price telephones? The telephone posed a fundamental problem – it was trivial to make. Anyone could make one; that is once they had seen a working model. How then were they going to prevent others from simply ignoring their patent rights and make and use telephones? Hubbard then made a seminal contribution. Still practicing law, Hubbard had a client that made shoe-making equipment. What had impressed Hubbard was that they did not sell their equipment, but put it out on lease, with the lease payments determined by the number of shoes made.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc264&quot; href=&quot;#fn264&quot;&gt;264&lt;/a&gt; Applying this same technique – leasing telephones, not selling them – Hubbard saw how to have absolute control over the distribution and use of the telephone. Leasing gave reason to keep track of who had legal telephones, and who did not, for every rightful lessee had to make regular payments, not simply a one time purchase. Leasing also carried the responsibility of service, and the right to replace telephones, presumably with better ones, as needed or competitively motivated. The telephone remained the property of the lessor, of the Bell interests. In May 1877, they began leasing two telephones to individuals for $20 a year and to businesses for $40 a year. Customers were responsible for stringing their own connecting wires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telephone business started out then as leasing pairs of telephones to individuals or businesses needing to communicate frequently between two locations. These point-to-point connections, or circuits, consisted simply of two telephones and connecting wire. No concept of a network existed. The paradigm was circuits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc265&quot; href=&quot;#fn265&quot;&gt;265&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hubbard’s clever solution of leasing phones still required more money to execute than they had. For instance: How were they going to find customers? Hubbard then contributed another critical idea – licensing, or franchising, independent agents to lease the telephones, and even construct the needed connecting circuits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc266&quot; href=&quot;#fn266&quot;&gt;266&lt;/a&gt; The agents would bear the expenses of selling and installing telephones, with their profits coming from a share of the telephone lease payments – 40 percent the first year, 20 percent thereafter&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc267&quot; href=&quot;#fn267&quot;&gt;267&lt;/a&gt; – and from constructing the connecting lines. The Bell Patent Association had only to identify and contract with agents, and then supply the telephones to be leased. Hubbard, who had made it his business to know anyone and everyone interested in telegraphy – a group certain to have interest in the telephone – proved a natural when it came to signing up agents, his personal network becoming the prime source of early agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same month, May 1877, a propitious experiment was conducted in Boston by an entrepreneur from within the same small, community known to Graham. Edwin T. Holmes, the enterprising son of the inventor of the burglar alarm, strung wires from his office to several other locations. His phone could then be switched to any outgoing circuit. Regarded as the first working example of a telephone switch, Holmes next began offering messaging and delivery services to those with connections. It became known as a “district system.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc268&quot; href=&quot;#fn268&quot;&gt;268&lt;/a&gt; The next logical innovation was to make a switch that could connect any two remote locations with each other. If possible, the economics and utility of having a telephone would improve dramatically. Sanders immediately began promoting the economic potential of switches as a means to raise needed investment capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No longer would the simple contractual relationship of the Bell Patent Association suffice, they needed to create an organization. On July 9, 1877, Hubbard formed a Massachusetts unincorporated association – the Bell Telephone Association, Gardiner G. Hubbard Trustee; capitalization: $300,000.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc269&quot; href=&quot;#fn269&quot;&gt;269&lt;/a&gt; (How much cash was made available is uncertain, but it wasn’t much.) Hubbard became the dominant executive both by dint of personality and because Graham, in assigning all his rights over to Mabel Hubbard, his speech student and new wife as of two days later, July 11, gave Hubbard de facto control.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc270&quot; href=&quot;#fn270&quot;&gt;270&lt;/a&gt; Further reflection of Graham’s desire to withdraw from the building of the business, in early August, he and his bride Mabel left for Europe where they spent the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hubbard began signing agents as fast as he could, and by November, 3,000 phones had been leased.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc271&quot; href=&quot;#fn271&quot;&gt;271&lt;/a&gt; The growth in activity and expenses left the Bell Telephone Association drained for cash. The financially-pressed Sanders had found investors – but only if Hubbard conceded his absolute power and authority. Hubbard stubbornly refused, despite the rumored entry of WU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Fall, in London, Graham wrote of the future of telephones for a prospectus meant to stimulate entrepreneurial action in the U. K. to commercialize the telephone. After first stressing the telephone’s uniqueness as being simple to use and usable by anyone, in contrast to the telegraph which required mastering Morse code and the operation of the telegraphic instrument, he wrote of its future:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe, in the future, wires will unite the head offices of the Telephone Company in different cities, and a man in one part of the country many communicate by word of mouth with another in a distant place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believing as I do…that such a scheme will be the ultimate result of introducing the telephone to the public, I will impress upon you all the advisability of keeping this end in view, that all present arrangements of the telephone may be eventually realized in this grand system….&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc272&quot; href=&quot;#fn272&quot;&gt;272&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grand system seemed an impossible dream given the existing circuit paradigm of telephony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, WU, with its Gold and Stock Company subsidiary&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc273&quot; href=&quot;#fn273&quot;&gt;273&lt;/a&gt; losing private telegraph lines to the telephone, concluded that it had to enter the telephone business. It formed the American Speaking Telephone Company (WU-AST),&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc274&quot; href=&quot;#fn274&quot;&gt;274&lt;/a&gt; as a subsidiary of Gold and Stock. WU-AST then exchanged its common stock for the telephone patents of a number of inventors, including Elisha Gray and A. E. Dolbear. It also extended its agreement with Edison. WU-AST, the $40 million giant, brashly announced that it had the “original” telephone and was ready to serve everyone. WU-AST was not going to let Graham’s patent, referred to derisively as scrap of paper,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc275&quot; href=&quot;#fn275&quot;&gt;275&lt;/a&gt; stand in the way of its success. As the news of WU’s entry spread, agents that had just months earlier scrambled to invest their moneys in Bell Telephone Association licenses began having second thoughts. Did the Bell Telephone Association have either the original patent, or the money, to withstand the assault of WU-AST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1878, the first commercial telephone switch – or “exchange service” – was established by George Coy, a telegraph manager in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc276&quot; href=&quot;#fn276&quot;&gt;276&lt;/a&gt; It was an immediate success. Even though he had known of Holmes’ experiment since May, Watson only then began developing a switch for the Bell Telephone Association – eight months later. It proved to be a much more challenging product to develop than Watson had assumed. He needed time, so Hubbard began urging agents to establish district systems as an interim strategy until they could provide a switch. Many of the more entrepreneurial agents began using switches innovated by independent inventors – creating a problem for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The switch changed the telephone business forever. It no longer sold private line circuits, but connection to switches. Switches, however, entailed a significant up-front capital investment by the agents – the “fixed” cost of a switch being required to establish even one circuit. These new costs had to be passed on to the users and initially averaged $5 to $6 per month – making the total annual costs to a business per telephone roughly $100. Even so, it still took years to recover the switch investment. The agents who bore these new, and unexpected, capital costs and risks, demanded protection from competition in the form of a local monopoly – which the Bell Telephone Association could grant by contract since they owned the property rights. The utility to the user came from the ability to connect to every one else; ideally, everyone would have a telephone and be connected to the same switch. Competition – multiple switches serving the same population – resulted in lower utility to the telephone user, since to connect to everyone required multiple telephones. (In the future this same utility argument will be invoked to justify the telephone monopoly as in the public’s best interest.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the switch also resulted in a “race to occupy the field.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc277&quot; href=&quot;#fn277&quot;&gt;277&lt;/a&gt; Given the argued logic for local monopoly, the successful telephone company would be the one offering service, i.e. having the monopoly, in all major cities. The pace of introducing telephone service became dictated by the need to have market coverage, not by Hubbard’s ability to find and sign agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1878, Hubbard relented to the demands of the existing New England agents and new investors. In a compromise, a new company was formed that would have the exclusive rights to use or dispose of the Bell patented telephone in the New England states.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc278&quot; href=&quot;#fn278&quot;&gt;278&lt;/a&gt; The New England Telephone Company (NETC) was capitalized at $200,000, but only $50,000 of cash, telephones, and necessary tools remained in NETC. (Half of the stock went to the new investors and half went to the original patentees for certain exclusive rights.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc279&quot; href=&quot;#fn279&quot;&gt;279&lt;/a&gt; The stock had to be distributed because the Bell Telephone Association could not hold stock in other corporations.) The model of local companies financed and managed by local investors and entrepreneurs who offered exchange services with geographical rights to the Bell patents had been innovated. Hubbard was president of NETC, but the real operating authority shifted to George L. Bradley, who had led the financing and became the new general manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of interconnecting the switches of the operating companies was already understood, as Hubbard inserted in the license agreement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Insomuch as said parties and their successors and assigns have a common interest in the working of continuous and connecting lines extending outside of New England, the said parties agree that they will endeavor to cooperate in the establishment of connecting lines and in the joint working of the same, and the division of the expense and the profits thereof pro rata upon some equally fair and equitable basis.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc280&quot; href=&quot;#fn280&quot;&gt;280&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another rule only experience could give meaning. Implied as well was another effort at cooperative behavior among like-kind organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cash crisis of the Bell Telephone Association proved merely deferred, for in March, Sanders was again sounding the alarm for money. Hubbard had added to his financialcrises by agreeing to help fund the expenses of the Chicago agent – a one Anson Stager, President of Western Electric Manufacturing Company&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc281&quot; href=&quot;#fn281&quot;&gt;281&lt;/a&gt; , now the manufacturer of product for WU-AST.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc282&quot; href=&quot;#fn282&quot;&gt;282&lt;/a&gt; Changing agents did not help – the financial drain persisted. The pressure on Hubbard to concede even more power and authority in order to secure new financing continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Knowing from the February 1878 financing that a condition of any new investment would be the hiring of a full-time general manager, Hubbard thought at once of Theodore Newton Vail. Hubbard, now a Congressman from Boston and a member of the Congressional Postal Committee, had met Vail during a cross country inspection tour of the mail system. Vail, the General Superintendent of the Railway Mail Service,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc283&quot; href=&quot;#fn283&quot;&gt;283&lt;/a&gt; had led the tour and was as impressive as his reputation would have him. When Hubbard, the consummate promoter, pulled out his two telephones, which he would do on every possible occasion, Vail immediately grasped their transformative potential – as would the man needed to build the telephone business.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc284&quot; href=&quot;#fn284&quot;&gt;284&lt;/a&gt; On their return to Washington, Hubbard had two telephones sent to Vail’s home, where he not only used them, but began promoting the prospect of their boundless future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Vail (1845-1920) knew by heart the story of Alfred Vail, his cousin once removed, Samuel F. B. Morse’s partner and chief technical collaborator.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc285&quot; href=&quot;#fn285&quot;&gt;285&lt;/a&gt; Vail’s father even managed the Speedwell Iron Works, the very place where Alfred had built Morse’s original telegraphs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc286&quot; href=&quot;#fn286&quot;&gt;286&lt;/a&gt; Vail gravitated to the telegraph as well. His first job was working in the local drug store, which also happened to be the local telegraph office. Before long he knew more about telegraphy and building telegraphs than he did drugs. At nineteen, his uncle Issac Quinby secured him a job with WU in New York city.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc287&quot; href=&quot;#fn287&quot;&gt;287&lt;/a&gt; In the diary he kept, he displayed a young man caught between his moral sense of duty and his self-indulgent instincts: Staying up late of nights playing Billiards and drinking lager is not what young men should be doing and for one I am determined to stop it.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc288&quot; href=&quot;#fn288&quot;&gt;288&lt;/a&gt; Intentions proved easier than practice, and with his career seemingly going no where, he moved with his family to Waterloo, Iowa in 1866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, farm life was not for Vail. On learning of telegraphic opportunities out West, he left to become the night trick with the Union Pacific Railroad in Wyoming.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc289&quot; href=&quot;#fn289&quot;&gt;289&lt;/a&gt; Then in 1869, Uncle Quinby came through again, and Vail was appointed a clerk with the Railway Mail Service. It proved the opportunity he needed, and he excelled. In 1873 he was promoted to headquarters in Washington D. C. There he revolutionized the processing of mail, dramatically improving service. In 1874, he became Assistant General Superintendent and in 1876, General Superintendent. As his finances improved, he began to invest in patents, always hoping to find one with the potential of the telegraph. His dream of future riches and influence differed from than his job, which was became more bureaucratic, more political, and less to his liking. His tolerance was exceeded when a Congressional hearing in early 1878 spent a day discussing the cost and appropriateness of his $5 a day per diem. Within days he told Hubbard he was ready to join the Bell Telephone Association, which he did in late June. When the news got out, most people were astounded – why would he throw away his career on another fantasy of Hubbard’s? One Congressman wrote Vail: Don’t rob the public of an invaluable servant just because we tried to cheat and starve you.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc290&quot; href=&quot;#fn290&quot;&gt;290&lt;/a&gt; His boss wrote to him: Listen to the prophesy of an old fool to a friend. One or two years hence there will be more Telephone companies in existence than there are sewing machine companies today.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc291&quot; href=&quot;#fn291&quot;&gt;291&lt;/a&gt; So just as Morse’s MTC had hired Kendall from the Postal System, so did Graham with Vail. (Vail will become the most dominant force in Bell’s history.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail inherited a desperate situation as the new general manager of the Bell Telephone Association. With every passing day it seemed more certain that the aggressive tactics of the colossus WU-AST would sink their struggling start-up. If that were not enough, Hubbard’s part-time, half-informed management practices had created such a mess within the organization, that if it did not collapse from external forces, it would implode from internal chaos. Without sufficient resources, and being stressed in more ways than imaginable, Vail needed to act fast and competently, for there was little chance he would have the opportunity to fix what he got wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First he had to contain, and hopefully reverse, the train wreck being created by WU-AST. To the morally inclined Vail, the fact that WU-AST was acting with total disregard of the Bell patent rights infuriated him, and gave him the strength of a cornered animal. Immediately he wrote to every agent to strengthen their competitive resolve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have the only original telephone patents. We have organized and introduced the business and we do not propose to have it taken away from us by any corporation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc292&quot; href=&quot;#fn292&quot;&gt;292&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks WU-AST announced a new telephone incorporating the transmitter innovated by Edison. Known as the “plumbago,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc293&quot; href=&quot;#fn293&quot;&gt;293&lt;/a&gt; or “carbon button,” it significantly outperformed Bell’s hammered metal diaphragm in transmitting speech. WU-AST wasted no time in pressing its new advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where WU-AST, like the Robber Barons that so influenced WU history, could not bully an agent into abandoning efforts, they tried to buy them out. In the two critical markets of New York City and Chicago the agents gave up. As added inducement for Vail to come aboard, he had been named the new agent for New York City. (One of his early acts as general manager was to grant the agency for Chicago to some friends.) Vail invested what little money he had, and could raise from friends, in the newly organized Bell Telephone Company of New York (BTC-NY). For it was in the latter that Vail had his equity ownership,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc294&quot; href=&quot;#fn294&quot;&gt;294&lt;/a&gt; not the parent organization – even though he was its general manager. Holmes, of the burglar alarm and switch, was made president of BTC-NY; Charles Williams became an investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, some of the immediate financial pressure eased with the incorporation in Massachusetts of the Bell Telephone Company (BTC). Capitalization was $450,000, although only $50,000 was new cash. It was assigned all the Bell patent rights outside New England. The investors had equal representation on the Board of Directors even though they had invested only $25,000; Sanders invested the other $25,000. An Executive Committee was also created, with Hubbard but one of three members. Vail became the full time general manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the creation of NETC, BTC-NY and now BTC,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc295&quot; href=&quot;#fn295&quot;&gt;295&lt;/a&gt; the fundamental structure of the Bell companies began assuming form. No longer was it a patent association that licensed agents and leased them telephones. Rather, the patent holders had transformed, or, more accurately, been transformed, into shareholders in two corporations: NETC and BTC. These two corporations, as holders of the patent rights, now licensed agents, and, in a new twist, took stock in the agents corporations – as they did with BTC-NY; Hubbard had agreed, on his own,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc296&quot; href=&quot;#fn296&quot;&gt;296&lt;/a&gt; to provide financing for BTC-NY in exchange for stock ownership. The financial return to be earned for holding the patents was now dividends, not a percentage of the lease payments. A holding company form of organization had been created, only without the company(s) holding the stock, for they couldn’t legally – it was 1878, four years before the Standard Oil Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only weeks aboard and with the finances seemingly under control, Vail now had to bring order to chaos. Much of it would come simply from the hand of a good, full-time general manger. But he also needed a coherent strategy to guide and inform his actions. By experience and vision, he agreed with Graham’s grand system. First the patent rights had to be asserted – and successfully. Then came building a company by 1893-1894 substantial enough to withstand the competition that would surely emerge when the patent rights expired. A competitively robust Bell was thought to consist of viable exchange services in all the major markets, interconnected with a long distance network. If accomplished by 1894, any competitor would have to build local switch services against entrenched competition, as well as find a way to offer integrated long distance calling. By having the grand system in place, effective competition would have to be national in scope, which would significantly raise the costs and risks of potential competitors. However, such a vision was a long way from reality as BTC was just then shipping its first modest switch, and the maximum distance of a long distance telephone call was in the tens of miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1878, Bell – BTC and NETC – filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Boston agent of WU-AST, Peter A. Dowd. In the same month. Vail acquired the patent rights to a transmitter developed by Emile Berliner, allowing Bell to file an interference suit against the yet-to-be issued Edison patent. This tactic permitted Bell to use a carbon transmitter, like Edison’s, without being immediately stopped by the courts. Fortune then prevailed, when in December, they acquired the patent rights to a transmitter invented by Francis Black Jr. – an improvement over Edison’s.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc297&quot; href=&quot;#fn297&quot;&gt;297&lt;/a&gt; By the end of 1878, Bell had a competitive, even better, telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WU-AST reacted as would be expected – by accelerating its efforts to force the Bell local agents out of business, or to buy them. Vail needed to provide financial assistance to the local agents who were confronted with all the costs and risks of becoming switch operators. For those willing to sign new contracts, Vail was prepared to advance them financial help – such as reducing or deferring telephone instrument lease payments – in return for becoming a shareholder. Vail’s efforts proved successful. BTC could not produce instruments fast enough. Where they could not supply enough telephones, WU-AST used its scale advantages of production and grew even faster.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc298&quot; href=&quot;#fn298&quot;&gt;298&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These competitive dynamics strained the weak financial conditions of both NETC and BTC. To survive and execute their grand system meant raising more money, which meant conceding even more authority to investors. They had little choice. Speaking with one voice, with pooled and new resources, seemed wiser than trying to coordinate policies and resources between two weakening firms. On March 20, 1879, the two companies were combined into the National Bell Telephone Company (NBTC). Capitalization was $850,000, with $430,000 of new cash.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc299&quot; href=&quot;#fn299&quot;&gt;299&lt;/a&gt; Hubbard stepped down, and left the company, unwilling to play a lesser role.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc300&quot; href=&quot;#fn300&quot;&gt;300&lt;/a&gt; William H. Forbes became the new president.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc301&quot; href=&quot;#fn301&quot;&gt;301&lt;/a&gt; Vail continued as general manager. While Graham still carried the title of electrician, Watson general inspector, and Sanders, Director, the influence of the four founders was effectively finished. Investors – Bostonians – had assumed financial control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both NBTC and WU were weakened by their struggle, a situation too tempting for the most notorious financial Robber Baron of the day, Jay Gould, to resist. Gould and WU first tangled in 1870 when he bought the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company (APT), from the Union Pacific Railroad.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc302&quot; href=&quot;#fn302&quot;&gt;302&lt;/a&gt; Gould built the APT into, if not a formidable, then a pesky competitor to WU. (Gould used to expert advantage the Sherman Act of 1866.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc303&quot; href=&quot;#fn303&quot;&gt;303&lt;/a&gt; )WU finally bought Gould out in 1877, but refused to give him a board seat. Seeing WU now susceptible to another take-over, in April 1878, Gould began buying into a number of NBTC licensees, a situation that worried the principal NBTC shareholders enough to cause them to sign an agreement forcing purchase of all of their stock to purchase any.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc304&quot; href=&quot;#fn304&quot;&gt;304&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Gould capitalized American Union Telegraph Company (AU) with $10 million. Into it he put telegraph systems and railroad right-of-ways he controlled. WU may not have feared NBTC, but Gould was different, particularly if he was successful in combining his telephone and telegraph interests. WU management, having by then received counseled from some of the best legal minds in the country that the Bell patents would prevail, decided to negotiate a settlement with NBTC, hoping to strengthen NBTC to Gould’s advances, and leave WU to focus on telegraphy and once again fend off Gould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WU began the negotiations willing to settle in favor of NBTC, that is if NBTC ceded WU control of long distance communications. While some NBTC shareholders were willing, Vail refused to abandon his strategy and WU’s proposal was rejected.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc305&quot; href=&quot;#fn305&quot;&gt;305&lt;/a&gt; Without a basis for agreement, yet both sides wanting to negotiate a settlement, each company created a three man team to negotiate. They also agreed not to launch new exchanges. But with each passing month, competition within existing exchanges became ever more brutal, with WU-AST giving telephones away, presumably to force NBTC to capitulate.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc306&quot; href=&quot;#fn306&quot;&gt;306&lt;/a&gt; Then on November 10, 1879, after an all-night negotiating session, Vail forced an agreement for the remaining period of the patents, seventeen years.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc307&quot; href=&quot;#fn307&quot;&gt;307&lt;/a&gt; (Vail won by threatening to enter the telegraph business.) WU agreed to: admit that Graham invented the telephone, exit the telephone business, and grant NBTC a license to all the telephone patents it had acquired or would acquire during the term of the agreement. NBTC agreed to: acquire all WU-AST telephones, of which there were over 56,000 in fifty-five cities, as well as fifty-five telephone exchanges;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc308&quot; href=&quot;#fn308&quot;&gt;308&lt;/a&gt; stay out of the telegraph business; and pay WU 20% of the royalties, or rentals, from telephone instruments.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc309&quot; href=&quot;#fn309&quot;&gt;309&lt;/a&gt; (Bell would end up paying WU $7 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc310&quot; href=&quot;#fn310&quot;&gt;310&lt;/a&gt; In 1881, Gould will sell AU to WU and, in the process, become the controlling member of WU’s board of directors.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc311&quot; href=&quot;#fn311&quot;&gt;311&lt;/a&gt; The intrigue between WU and Bell will be continued.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of the settlement in 1879, NBTC’s stock price soared to $1,000 per share, an increase of 2,000% from the March price of $50 per share.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc312&quot; href=&quot;#fn312&quot;&gt;312&lt;/a&gt; The original four founders became millionaires. Vail became a millionaire by selling shares of his stock in BTC-NY to NBTC to give them control of BTC-NY.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc313&quot; href=&quot;#fn313&quot;&gt;313&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement between NBTC and WU had profound historical consequences. In order to uphold its terms of the settlement, as well as perform as the surviving monopoly, NBTC took actions and adopted attitudes that persisted for nearly one hundred years – until the convergence of telecommunications and computers. The effects on NBTC can be summarized into four themes: the need for more money, the legal battles over patent rights, the need to rationalize product supply, and the institutionalization of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To buy WU’s installed base of 56,000 telephones and fifty-five exchanges with switching equipment meant raising millions of dollars, something NBTC could not do under its existing Massachusetts incorporation agreement. Furthermore, it needed broadened rights to do business in other states and own stock in licensees as well as other telephone-related companies – like manufacturers. To effect such changes in their incorporation charter meant securing approval of the Massachusetts legislature. Counsel warned management that winning these changes would not be easy, for no longer would they be viewed as a sympathetic, struggling upstart, but another to-be-feared monopoly. Counsel’s advise proved correct, once the changes were requested, political opposition emerged. The first bill to be reported out of the Senate Committee on Mercantile Affairs granted only half the increase in capitalization, restricted the new money from being used to purchase patents, and subjected telephone rates to regulation by the state’s Board of Railroad Commissions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc314&quot; href=&quot;#fn314&quot;&gt;314&lt;/a&gt; After more negotiations and hearings, the legislature approved the American Bell Telephone Company charter on April 2, 1880. Capitalization was $10 million, not the $15 million requested, and ownership of Massachusetts licensees could not exceed 30% – elsewhere there were no constraints. The call for rate regulation had been dropped. On April 17, 1880, NBTC became the American Bell Telephone Company (ABTC) – initial capitalization: $7.35 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc315&quot; href=&quot;#fn315&quot;&gt;315&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of the negotiated settlement with WU was that it left unanswered the question: How would the court’s rule on the validity of Graham’s patents? This uncertainty encouraged others who thought they had legitimate patent rights, and many others who had no qualms fabricating such rights, to enter the telephone business. Contributing to the surge in competition was the anti-Big Business attitude of the early 1880’s – as exemplified by the state Quo Warranto suits. This political climate bolstered the resolve of all those who saw an opportunity to make money from the telephone simply by entering the business, regardless of the rights of ABTC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc316&quot; href=&quot;#fn316&quot;&gt;316&lt;/a&gt; If denied their economic freedom to compete by the court, they had confidence they would win it back by legislative action. From 1880 to 1893, ABTC filed six hundred patent infringement lawsuits, with five collections of cases – Amos E. Dolbear et al., Molecular Telephone Company et al., Clay Commercial Telephone Company et al., People’s Telephone Company et al., Overland Telephone Company et al. – all appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight over ABTC’s patent rights was not limited to the courts. One such case was that of the Pan Electric Telephone Company (PETC). Founded in 1883 around the patents of J. Harris Rogers, PETC had two U. S. Senators as directors. In November 1884, ABTC filed suit against PETC. Those supporting PETC then attempted to pass legislation in Congress authorizing the Government to file suit and vacate patents under certain circumstances – such as those of ABTC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc317&quot; href=&quot;#fn317&quot;&gt;317&lt;/a&gt; The measure passed the House, but not the Senate Committee on Patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards, PETC’s attorney became Attorney General of the United States. When requested to file suit against Graham’s patents, to have them declared fraudulent and invalid since Graham was not first to have invented the telephone, the Attorney General declined to do so – presumably because of clear conflict of interest. But when he left Washington for a few days, another conveniently timed request was made, and on one day’s examination, the Justice Department filed suit against ABTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Circuit Court hearing The American Bell Telephone Company et al. v. The Pan Electric Company et al. then ruled for ABTC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc318&quot; href=&quot;#fn318&quot;&gt;318&lt;/a&gt; PETC’s lawyer argued that any decision should be stayed until the government’s case against ABTC was decided. If the Court agreed, PETC could continue doing business. However, in the rush to file suit, the Justice Department had committed an oversight, and the case had to be temporarily withdrawn. President Forbes of ABTC then met President Grover Cleveland to argue ABTC’s case. (See Appendix 2.4 Excerpts of President Hudson’s Request.) Without the pending case against ABTC, the Circuit Court rejected PETC’s request for a stay: PETC did not appeal. On January 1, 1887, the Government filed United States v The American Bell Telephone Company and Alexander Graham Bell. Over a year later, March 19, 1888, the Supreme Court ruled by a vote of four-to-three in favor of ABTC in all five cases before it. Nine years later, in 1896, two years after Graham’s patents had expired, the government abandoned its case.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc319&quot; href=&quot;#fn319&quot;&gt;319&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third consequence to ABTC of its settlement with WU in 1879 was the need to rationalize its product supply. ABTC needed a more reliable and larger supply of product than their string of small production shops centered around Charles William. In February 1880, ABTC had 60, 873 telephones with licensees and 138 exchanges and was about to take-over the 56,000 telephones and fifty-five exchanges of WU. All of these telephones had to be upgraded to instruments with both a transmitter and a receiver, meanwhile satisfying the growing demand for new telephones. These unprecedented demands on production capacity needed an immediate solution. Two decisions were made: buy control of Western Electric Manufacturing Company (WE) and standardize the telephone. WE was the largest electrical manufacturer in the country, and WU’s telephone supplier. As part of the settlement agreement between ABTC and WU, WU severed its formal relationship with WE. In July 1881, ABTC bought 40% of WE.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc320&quot; href=&quot;#fn320&quot;&gt;320&lt;/a&gt; In February 1882, ABTC increased their controlling ownership to 52.05%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc321&quot; href=&quot;#fn321&quot;&gt;321&lt;/a&gt; Then ABTC and WE signed agreements under which ABTC agreed to buy only from WE, and WE agreed to sell only to ABTC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc322&quot; href=&quot;#fn322&quot;&gt;322&lt;/a&gt; (This agreement becomes a century long focus of government investigation and legal action.) The second decision was to standardize. Standardization was needed if there was to be high volume, high quality, low cost production. Standardization both simplified switch design and implementation, in essence creating a barrier, a firewall, against competitor’s efforts to penetrate transmission and switch technologies. The telephone was simple – so they standardized. Transmission and switching requirements were complex and difficult – so they invested in innovation with the objective to create protective patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fourth consequence of the 1879 settlement was the institutionalization of innovation. Having established its monopoly, Vail next needed to materialize the grand system before Graham’s patents expired. To do so meant growing the local exchanges into competitively viable operations and then interconnecting them with long distance calling. But Bell did not have the mastery of the technologies needed to execute Vail’s vision. Vail had two strategies: acquire every patent possible and begin internal development of needed technologies. By 1894, Bell acquired over nine hundred telephone patents&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc323&quot; href=&quot;#fn323&quot;&gt;323&lt;/a&gt; – Vail would call them”a thousand and one little patents and inventions.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc324&quot; href=&quot;#fn324&quot;&gt;324&lt;/a&gt; (Undoubtedly some patent acquisitions were in lieu of patent lawsuits.) In 1881, in addition to investing in WE, obtaining their technologies and patents, ABTC created an Electrical and Patent Department&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc325&quot; href=&quot;#fn325&quot;&gt;325&lt;/a&gt; to conduct development of transmission and switching systems as well as evaluate outside inventions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc326&quot; href=&quot;#fn326&quot;&gt;326&lt;/a&gt; A telecommunications system became, therefore, instruments connected to a network consisting of transmission and switching. (See Exhibit 2.10 A Telecommunications System)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-210-a-telecommunications-system&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.10 A Telecommunications System&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-10-a-telecommunications-system.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.10 A Telecommunications System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While WE and WU patents enhanced Bell’s switching competence,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc327&quot; href=&quot;#fn327&quot;&gt;327&lt;/a&gt; two transmission problems remained unsolved: underground cabling and long distance transmission. In the larger exchanges, such as New York City, the ugly tangle of overhead wiring had become both impossible to keep operational, and a source of public protest. By 1884, public demand to âPut the wires underground caused the New York Legislature to pass a law requiring underground cabling and created a commission to assure the law’s compliance&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc328&quot; href=&quot;#fn328&quot;&gt;328&lt;/a&gt; . In 1885, ABTC filed such a plan,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc329&quot; href=&quot;#fn329&quot;&gt;329&lt;/a&gt; and by year-end nearly 750 miles of underground cabling had been installed. (By 1889, New York City had eleven thousand miles of underground cabling.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc330&quot; href=&quot;#fn330&quot;&gt;330&lt;/a&gt; )Long distance transmission proved even more intractable. In 1880, when the longest working line was twenty-eight miles,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc331&quot; href=&quot;#fn331&quot;&gt;331&lt;/a&gt; work began on a circuit connecting New York City and Boston. Early frustrations in achieving acceptable transmission quality prompted John J. Carty, a project engineer, to try using a complete metal circuit instead of a single wire with ground return. The performance improved profoundly, ushering in long distance telephony. In 1883, Bell created a laboratory to do research in long distance telephony.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc332&quot; href=&quot;#fn332&quot;&gt;332&lt;/a&gt; And in the Spring of 1884, long distance service was established between Boston and New York City.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc333&quot; href=&quot;#fn333&quot;&gt;333&lt;/a&gt; It would take until 1892 to establish service to Chicago, immediately prior to the patents expiring, and 1914 to connect to San Francisco. The success in solving the problems of underground cabling and long distance transmission confirmed the value of internally directed innovation – not simply relying on others to innovate. As the telephone system became ever more complicated, outside innovation became less and less likely to be of help. Even so, laboratory innovation remained focused on incremental improvement, not achieving radical technological progress.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc334&quot; href=&quot;#fn334&quot;&gt;334&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail at last had technology capable of turning his vision into reality. A next logical extension of the network was to link New York and Philadelphia. To raise the money needed, ABTC sought permission from the Massachusetts Legislature to increase its capital from $10 million to $30 million, and to issue the stock at par. Their request was turned down because construction and operation of long distance telephone lines caused ABTC to be classified as a public service corporation, and public service corporations could not issue stock at par when the market price exceeded par, as it did in ABTC’s case.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc335&quot; href=&quot;#fn335&quot;&gt;335&lt;/a&gt; Not to be denied, ABTC incorporated the American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;amp;T) in New York to take advantage of the more favorable incorporation laws. (See Appendix 2.5 The AT&amp;amp;T Charter. This charter shows the erosion of States’ control over corporations.) Vail, in an effort to reduce his workload, resigned as general manager of ABTC and became President of AT&amp;amp;T. Even so, his strategy remained in place and ABTC continued to add local exchanges as they had once created BTC-NY, by finding local investors yet keeping 30 to 50% of the stock for license rights to ABTC’s patents, technical assistance and exclusive equipment contracts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc336&quot; href=&quot;#fn336&quot;&gt;336&lt;/a&gt; ABTC also began offering licensees permanent contracts in lieu of their traditional five year contracts if the licensees gave ABTC stock ranging from 30 to 50% – usually 35%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc337&quot; href=&quot;#fn337&quot;&gt;337&lt;/a&gt; These new permanent license contracts limited the financing options of the licensees; such as not being able to borrow money without the permission of the licenser, and having to issue new capital stock, not invest profits, for the funds to expand the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These four attendant consequences of the 1879 settlement – increased need for capital, yet the threat of regulation; elimination of WU as competitor, but protracted patent fights in the courts, legislatures, and executive suites; standardization of the telephone, as well as acquisition of WE and subsequent stranglehold on product being used in the telephone system; and, the institutionalization and success of innovation – all set in place the assets and competencies needed to realize Vail’s strategic vision. But they also gave rise to a besieged mentality that caused Bell to want to insulate itself from competition and outside interference. They did so by standardizing at the periphery of the network – at the time only the telephone – and building a network so advanced and protected, not only with patents but an organization dedicated to innovation, that no one would ever want to take them on. (See Exhibit 2.11 Bell’s Telecommunications System Strategy.) This emergent attitude and collective purpose became so embedded that it took nearly a century for it to be successfully challenged and forced to change – and now the focus of this reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail’s unswerving drive to create a national system brought him into increasing conflict with the Boston investors controlling the company. Building a national network cost money, lots of money. However, the controlling investors were more interested in distributing dividends than re-investing profits into network expansion. For example, in 1882, ABTC distributed $600,000 in dividends when profits totalled only $1 million. In total, by 1894, when the two basic patents expired, $25 million in dividends had been paid out, for roughly a 46% average return on investment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc338&quot; href=&quot;#fn338&quot;&gt;338&lt;/a&gt; In addition to the dividend return on capital invested, the value of early owners’ stock increased ten times their costs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc339&quot; href=&quot;#fn339&quot;&gt;339&lt;/a&gt; The differences between Vail and the investors came to a head in 1887, when Vail was not named company president. He resigned and left the telephone business to pursue personal investments. (He will return.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-211-bells-telecommunications-system-strategy&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.11 Bell’s Telecommunications System Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-11-bells-telecommunications-strategy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.11 Bell's Telecommunications System Strategy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;era-of-competition-1894-1906&quot;&gt;Era of Competition 1894-1906&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1891, the U. S. Patent Office, after a fourteen year investigation of prior art, finally issued to ABTC, as assignee of Berliner, a patent for his telephone transmitter – surprisingly still the best available. To Bell’s management, the delay must have seemed like a gift. For now they could extend their monopoly of the telephone to 1908 – the seventeen years of patent protection – giving them more time to build network superiority. James Storrow, Bell’s lawyer, wrote President Hudson: “The Bell Company has had a monopoly more profitable and more controlling – and more generally hated – than any ever given by any patent. The attempt to prolong it…by the Berliner patent will bring a great strain on that patent and a great pressure on the courts.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc340&quot; href=&quot;#fn340&quot;&gt;340&lt;/a&gt; He couldn’t have been more prescient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell was easy to hate in a time when it was popular to hate Big Businesses. Bell’s unpopularity stemmed from the obscenely high prices they were thought to be charging, the marginal service they provided, and their unwillingness to expand telephone service to meet demand. As proof of high prices, people pointed to the egregious dividends being paid. Poor service needed no proof, for everyone agreed it often bordered on barely working.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc341&quot; href=&quot;#fn341&quot;&gt;341&lt;/a&gt; And as for not extending service to the sparsely populated Western states, or to rural farm communities, Bell management believed that if expanded telephone service was not profitable from the start, then why incur the expenses. This almost customer be damned attitude reflected a corporate culture that treated the telephone as Bell’s to do with as pleased, including the right to earn a monopolist’s capital return.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc342&quot; href=&quot;#fn342&quot;&gt;342&lt;/a&gt; And as for not asserting the Berliner patent rights, fighting change at the periphery of their network was core to Bell’s competitive strategy. So even though they were warned not to enforce the Berliner patent, management saw a way to extend their control over the telephone and were determined to make the most of it; in a sense, who could blame them given their unblemished litigation record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1893, the Attorney General of the United States filed suit in Massachusetts to have Berliner’s patent annulled on the grounds that it was wrongfully delayed by the Patent Office, with ABTC’s complicity. In 1894, the Federal Court of Massachusetts ruled the patent null and void. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, and, in 1897, the Supreme Court sustained the patent.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc343&quot; href=&quot;#fn343&quot;&gt;343&lt;/a&gt; Then, in 1903, in a patent infringement suit against the National Telephone Company, the Berliner patent was construed so narrowly as to end its effectiveness. The courts’ attitude towards Bell shifted in 1897 when the Court began ruling very narrowly in many of the seventy-four patent infringement suits Bell filed, a change very much induced by an unwillingness of the courts to be perceived as favoring a monopolist.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc344&quot; href=&quot;#fn344&quot;&gt;344&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell’s efforts to suppress competition by enforcing the Berliner patent had little effect on all those who had hungered for years to be free of Bell’s monopoly. Beginning in 1894, competitors emerged and, by 1900, over five hundred new telephone companies were forming a year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc345&quot; href=&quot;#fn345&quot;&gt;345&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 2.12 New Telephone Companies by Year.) Competition made it possible for those without telephone service, as well as those with only visions of making money by entering the telephone business, to install their own telephones. AT&amp;amp;T had correctly anticipated that competition would emerge after their two key patents expired – that many thousands of new telephone companies would form surely came as an unwelcome surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-212-new-telephone-companies-by-year&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.12 New Telephone Companies by Year&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

 &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*AT&amp;amp;T Patents Expire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: Commercial systems include all for-profit companies competing with the Bell System, whereas mutual systems were cooperatives in which profit was a secondary concern to telephone service itself.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABTC’s competitive strategy required coordinated collective behavior delivering utility to users as one telephone with universal connectivity. Coordinated collective behavior meant licensees acting like one organization – local competition might be unavoidable, but regional, or, even worse, national, competition had to be resisted in every way possible. Since ABTC was the major shareholder of only a few licensees, gaining collective agreement would not be easy. For those licensees facing competition, and about half did (See Exhibit 2.13 Telephone Competition - 1898.), ABTC wanted the licensees to respond aggressively, even if it meant losing money.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc346&quot; href=&quot;#fn346&quot;&gt;346&lt;/a&gt; (ABTC favored aggressive competition over acquisition of competitors because of the threat of antitrust, or regulatory, actions by Federal or State governments. An acquisition strategy might also have the unintended effect of encouraging more competition. Weakening competitors held the possibility that if acquisitions eventually became necessary, the prices paid would be lower.) If pursuing aggressive tactics meant licensees needed financial help, ABTC stood ready with capital to invest which had the effect of making ABTC an ever larger shareholder, and, therefore, increasingly able to dictate licensees’ behavior. Competition, therefore, had the effect of consolidating the Bell interests. (Between 1885 and 1889, ABTC increased its ownership in seven key licensees from 13% to 52%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc347&quot; href=&quot;#fn347&quot;&gt;347&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instructing licensees to compete aggressively also required ABTC to grant financial assistance by reducing the telephone rental rates it was charging. From 1885 to 1893, telephone rental rates received by ABTC from the licensees had ranged from $5.38 to $5.84 per month.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc348&quot; href=&quot;#fn348&quot;&gt;348&lt;/a&gt; In 1894, the average rate dropped to $3.89, in 1895, $2.18, and by 1898, $1.45. ABTC rental income peaked in 1893 at $3,256,000, and, even with unprecedented growth in telephones, telephone rental income dropped to $1,611,000 by 1898. ABTC’s total income from the licensees – both telephone rentals and dividends – remained essentially flat, however, dividend income increased from $1,824,000 in 1893 to $3,239,000 in 1898. Dividend income increased as ABTC became an ever larger shareholder in licensees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-213-telephone-competition---1898&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.13 Telephone Competition - 1898&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

   &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Total Telephone Companies&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3988&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Each percent column represents a different analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price competition also required a change in the historical practice of billing telephone service as an annual fixed price with no constraints on use. The issue of how to best price telephone service had been debated ever since the first meeting of licensees as the National Telephone Exchange Association in 1880.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc349&quot; href=&quot;#fn349&quot;&gt;349&lt;/a&gt; Most licensees felt they were losing money with the simple flat charge and sought a new system of less expensive pricing for infrequent use and continuous pricing for extensive use. Now that competition was forcing lower prices, and experience had suggested users would pay more for a system with high connectivity, message unit pricing&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc350&quot; href=&quot;#fn350&quot;&gt;350&lt;/a&gt; became a way to price to market need. (The underlying problem being that switching suffered diseconomies of scale. New York City was converted to message unit pricing in June 1894.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of needing more capital to invest in licensees as well as its long distance services, and experiencing flat income, made raising capital not only necessary, but significantly more difficult and compromising. Wisely, ABTC had anticipated the need for capital before competition began. In 1889, it received approval from the Massachusetts Legislature to increase its authorized capital to $20 million. In 1894, ABTC sought another increase, to $50 million, which was approved by the legislature but vetoed by the governor. The governor believed the increase unnecessary, and, because in his mind ABTC was a public service corporation, it had to obey the public service laws and restrictions, including no stock-watering – such as raising unnecessary capital. Feeling stressed to raise money, President Hudson acquiesced, and a bill was passed recognizing ABTC as a public service corporation and increasing its authorized capital to $50 million. When more capital was needed in 1899, ABTC and its New York subsidiary consolidated with AT&amp;amp;T becoming the new parent holding company&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc351&quot; href=&quot;#fn351&quot;&gt;351&lt;/a&gt; – the laws of New York were more beneficial and did not require AT&amp;amp;T to be classified as a public service corporation. Thus in 1899, the historical parade of Bell companies finally ended. AT&amp;amp;T held all the stock of the licensees, including ABTC. The newly authorized capital of AT&amp;amp;T was $100 million – twice the capitalization of ABTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1899, President Hudson suddenly and unexpectedly died.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc352&quot; href=&quot;#fn352&quot;&gt;352&lt;/a&gt; The Board of Directors tried to convince Vail to return, but he declined saying he had too many other obligations. Frederick P. Fish, a patent lawyer and director of AT&amp;amp;T, was elected the new President. Fish believed AT&amp;amp;T had to meet the competition by growing, and by changing Bell’s disreputable image to one dedicated to public service – the customer had to be treated as important, not as lucky to have whatever service they were getting. In 1903, he wrote: We must give good service and must do everything that is necessary to have good service. Most of our opposition troubles are due, not so much to rates as to two other things, namely, bad service and not covering the field.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc353&quot; href=&quot;#fn353&quot;&gt;353&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Fish also believed in squashing every effort by competitors to organize long distance services. The independents knew they had to offer long distance services if they were to be successful, and a number of efforts to establish such services were attempted. The most serious effort began in November 1899 with the incorporation in New Jersey of the Telephone, Telegraph and Cable Company of America (TTCCA); authorized capitalization: $30 million. Financed in part by the Rockefellers, TTCCA planned to become a totally integrated telephone company and immediately began investing in local exchange companies. Soon thereafter, some of the key backers of TTCCA withdrew their support, allegedly persuaded by J. P. Morgan, who was owed favors by those involved.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc354&quot; href=&quot;#fn354&quot;&gt;354&lt;/a&gt; Morgan’s interest sprang from a desire to consolidate the communications industry as he had the railroads, and do for steel and other industries. In 1902, AT&amp;amp;T sold 50,000 shares of stock to a small group of investors, including Morgan, and then added three new members its Board of Directors&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc355&quot; href=&quot;#fn355&quot;&gt;355&lt;/a&gt; – two bankers and Vail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new board members bolstered Hudson’s resolve to change AT&amp;amp;T’s culture to compete aggressively. In 1902, three actions taken had lasting impact: a change in the basic terms of the Bell licensing agreement, the introduction of AT&amp;amp;T’s first PBX, and a more accommodating policy towards competitors. The steady erosion of telephone rentals to AT&amp;amp;T, and the odds against the trend ever reversing, motivated AT&amp;amp;T to replace its license fee of rentals or royalties on telephones with a 4.5% fee on licensees gross revenues. Fish sold the change on the basis that it would: involve a substantial reduction in the amounts paid to AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc356&quot; href=&quot;#fn356&quot;&gt;356&lt;/a&gt; The asset value of telephones, however, would remain on the books of AT&amp;amp;T. This change would become a source of bitter contention with emerging state regulatory authorities.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc357&quot; href=&quot;#fn357&quot;&gt;357&lt;/a&gt; For instance: What was the justification for 4.5%? AT&amp;amp;T responded by stonewalling the regulators, taking the view that the value received was greater than the fee paid and that was all that mattered; specifically, AT&amp;amp;T’s cost to deliver such services was irrelevant. It took decades and three Supreme Court decisions to resolve the controversies of this new agreement.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc358&quot; href=&quot;#fn358&quot;&gt;358&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bell changed its pricing to one based on message units, the benefits of this reduced entry level pricing to match competition as well as continuous pricing to discourage unnecessary telephone use, but it also created serious problems with AT&amp;amp;T’s most treasured customers – businesses.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc359&quot; href=&quot;#fn359&quot;&gt;359&lt;/a&gt; Businesses, the most intense users of telephones, saw their costs increase at a time when most were aggregating into larger organizations that demanded more internal communications to coordinate increasingly complex operations. A solution to this need for cheap, unlimited intraorganizational communications had first appeared in 1879 – the private branch exchange, or PBX.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc360&quot; href=&quot;#fn360&quot;&gt;360&lt;/a&gt; A PBX was an on-premises exchange, or switch, that enabled a large number of internal telephones to connect to each other without involving AT&amp;amp;T, or other common-carrier, switches or lines. At the same time, the PBX had a smaller number of trunks, or lines, that were connected to the common-carrier network. When an internal telephone needed to be connected to an outside line, it could, and would incur common-carrier charges. All internally connected calls, however, would not incur costs other than those attendant to the PBX itself – before the PBX all calls had to involve common-carrier lines and charges.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc361&quot; href=&quot;#fn361&quot;&gt;361&lt;/a&gt; By 1897 there were 150 PBX’s in New York City, none of which were AT&amp;amp;T’s. Not until 1902 did AT&amp;amp;T introduce its first PBX, known as the No. 1 PBX.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc362&quot; href=&quot;#fn362&quot;&gt;362&lt;/a&gt; Limited to two sizes: 30 or 80 maximum subscriber (internal) lines. It was succeeded by the No. 2 PBX in 1903, and newer models almost every year. (By 1929, 130,000 PBX’s were in operation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc363&quot; href=&quot;#fn363&quot;&gt;363&lt;/a&gt; ) The PBX facilitated, even made possible, the consolidations into large organizations of the 1898-1907 period. (Their use helps explain the drastic drop in common-carrier connections in 1903. (See Exhibit 2.8 Growth Rate in Calls Per Day))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third important change of 1902 involved AT&amp;amp;T’s attitude towards competitors. First, AT&amp;amp;T adopted a more lenient policy toward independents allowing those independents operating where Bell had no intent of initiating service to connect to their system. All equipment, however, had to be WE supplied. Even so, this more accommodative policy had immediate impact. At the end of 1901, less than 50,000 independent telephones connected to the Bell system. In 1902, the number nearly doubled to 84,000, and would increase substantially every year after.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc364&quot; href=&quot;#fn364&quot;&gt;364&lt;/a&gt; A second change in AT&amp;amp;T’s attitude towards the Independents was a willingness to make acquisitions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc365&quot; href=&quot;#fn365&quot;&gt;365&lt;/a&gt; These changes, while meaningful, did little to ameliorate the hostility felt by most independents who increasingly sought political solutions to what they could not achieve through market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As committed as AT&amp;amp;T became to staving off competition, by 1907 the Independents had installed almost as many telephones as had Bell – 2,987,000 Independent telephones versus 3,132,00 for Bell.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc366&quot; href=&quot;#fn366&quot;&gt;366&lt;/a&gt; The declining fortunes of AT&amp;amp;T combined with its more aggressive growth posture necessitated raising ever larger amounts of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1906, AT&amp;amp;T sold $150 million of convertible bonds to a syndicate of New York investment banks led by J. P. Morgan.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc367&quot; href=&quot;#fn367&quot;&gt;367&lt;/a&gt; Days after the sale, the terms of the bonds were changed so that the bankers maintained full control over bond rights until the syndicate dissolved, in roughly two years. When only $20 million of the bonds could be sold, reflecting growing disillusionment with AT&amp;amp;T’s financial performance and negative public image, the bankers asserted their new powers and demanded a reorganization committee to review what could and should be done to turn the situation around. The committee, Vail a member, proceeded to study the contemporary changes to many of the large industrial corporations – the result of 1898-1906. Although Fish was re-elected President at the March Shareholder meeting, the investment bankers continued to press for change, and on May 1, 1907, Fish resigned. The Board of Directors then persuaded Vail to return as President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;vail-rejoins-att-1907-1919&quot;&gt;Vail Rejoins AT&amp;amp;T 1907-1919&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixty-two-year-old Vail brought vision and leadership to an AT&amp;amp;T badly in need of both. Gone were the joys of building the grand system; replaced with the drudgery of competing and the stresses that predictably followed. The day-to-day details had sunk the lofty ideals for the great Yankee invention into the unrecognizable, and Vail was just the man needed to reinvigorate an organization that had passed him over two decades earlier. For Vail, having since earned millions investing in international ventures, as well as recently suffering the tragic deaths of both his wife and daughter, the time was at hand to do great deeds and to leave his mark. He was prepared and ready, and had as his friend and visionary banker, the great consolidator of American industry, J. P. Morgan. Together they would transform a weakening AT&amp;amp;T into telecommunication’s monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail’s passion to create a national telephone system with AT&amp;amp;T in control may have been born in economic logic, but it was fueled by his sense of what was morally right. To achieve his objective he needed to strengthen AT&amp;amp;T, eliminate competition, leverage technology and ward off potential government interference. He knew what he wanted and had to do and wasted no time getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening AT&amp;amp;T meant first of all raising badly needed cash. The six-month moratorium of capital investment had wreaked havoc with not only essential telephone construction, but with the perception of AT&amp;amp;T’s corporate viability. (Corporate debt had zoomed to $202 million in 1907, three times that of 1902.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc368&quot; href=&quot;#fn368&quot;&gt;368&lt;/a&gt; ) Unless AT&amp;amp;T could reliably provide the capital needed by the licensees, as well as fund the development of its long distance network, there was no prediction of what might happen. So even though AT&amp;amp;T stock now sold for $115 a share, having traded as high as $186 in 1902, Vail offered to sell existing shareholders one share for $100 for every six shares they owned. Despite depressed market conditions and the strong reservations of AT&amp;amp;T’s financial advisors, the May financing proved successful and AT&amp;amp;T raised $20 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc369&quot; href=&quot;#fn369&quot;&gt;369&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the cash problem temporarily solved, Vail next tackled the more difficult problem of company morale and confidence. He traveled, he talked, he listened, and he demonstrated that even his legendary reputation was no match for the Vail that now swept away their doubts and had them all believing in the importance of the telephone, the mission of AT&amp;amp;T, and his ability to lead them to success. That summer he invited Bell personnel from around the country to sail the Hudson River and Long Island Sound aboard the yacht Mohican, where he graciously played host and began building the personal relationships that transformed work into cause. Vail led as only a man of vision and character could, and the people of AT&amp;amp;T responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vision as large as the one bequeathed by Graham and operationalized by Vail left little room for the divisive competition that had overtaken the telephone business. Vail wasted no time making it known that AT&amp;amp;T had changed its ways. In August, he changed long standing policy so independents could buy equipment from WE, whether they connected to the Bell system or not. When the October 1907 stock market crash pushed many independents to the brink of disaster, Vail began acquiring them rather than trying to force them into bankruptcy.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc370&quot; href=&quot;#fn370&quot;&gt;370&lt;/a&gt; The new AT&amp;amp;T wanted to lead, not bully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail, who believed in the unlimited possibilities of technology, must have been shocked to learn how little AT&amp;amp;T had innovated for all the money it had spent. Under written directions from Morgan to cut costs: We consider it of vital consequence to the financial welfare of the Company that no expenditures should be entered upon in the near future, except such as are absolutely necessary, no matter what the prospective profits on other expenditures may be,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc371&quot; href=&quot;#fn371&quot;&gt;371&lt;/a&gt; Vail complied, firing 12,000 employees. He also reorganized and centralized research and development. First, he replaced Hammond V. Hayes as head of engineering&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc372&quot; href=&quot;#fn372&quot;&gt;372&lt;/a&gt; with his old friend, and innovator of the two-wire circuit, John J. Carty. Carty immediately reduced both staff and expenses, and then transferred the technical staff from Boston and Chicago to New York; where some joined the staff at AT&amp;amp;T headquarters and the balance worked at WE.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc373&quot; href=&quot;#fn373&quot;&gt;373&lt;/a&gt; Carty, unlike Hayes, believed in fundamental research and the importance of technology to progress: I believe it will be found in any social organism that the degree of development reached by its telephone system will be an important indication of the progress which it has made in attaining coordination and solidarity.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc374&quot; href=&quot;#fn374&quot;&gt;374&lt;/a&gt; Carty’s promotion marks the true beginnings of scientific research and its institutionalization within AT&amp;amp;T; those transferred to WE will form the basis of the future Bell Laboratories. No longer would each of the local telephone companies innovate, innovation would be centralized.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc375&quot; href=&quot;#fn375&quot;&gt;375&lt;/a&gt; Carty also stressed the importance of standardization&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc376&quot; href=&quot;#fn376&quot;&gt;376&lt;/a&gt; – going so far as to ban further use of the French handset telephone which had the receiver and transmitter in a single handle; not until 1927 would AT&amp;amp;T reintroduce a single-handed model.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc377&quot; href=&quot;#fn377&quot;&gt;377&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first the style of innovation under Carty remained incremental.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc378&quot; href=&quot;#fn378&quot;&gt;378&lt;/a&gt; Then in late 1908-early 1909, Vail set the goal of transcontinental telephone service by the time of the upcoming San Francisco Panama-Pacific Exposition scheduled for 1914; impossible to even contemplate without a broad-based, organized engineering effort.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc379&quot; href=&quot;#fn379&quot;&gt;379&lt;/a&gt; By 1910, AT&amp;amp;T’s research laboratories were beginning to stress new, radical innovation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc380&quot; href=&quot;#fn380&quot;&gt;380&lt;/a&gt; And by 1912, Vail could pronounce that AT&amp;amp;T was capable of continuing to grow indefinitely not only in size but in constantly increasing efficiency and usefulness.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc381&quot; href=&quot;#fn381&quot;&gt;381&lt;/a&gt; (Acquisition of the patents of outside inventors will continue to be important however – the audion tubeof Lee De Forest (1913) being such an example.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc382&quot; href=&quot;#fn382&quot;&gt;382&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Vail’s efforts to create a dominant AT&amp;amp;T were threatened, however, by growing public sentiment that the telephone business, and especially AT&amp;amp;T, should be regulated, broken-up, or worse yet, taken over by the government. The signs were everywhere and hard to ignore.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc383&quot; href=&quot;#fn383&quot;&gt;383&lt;/a&gt; Vail, totally dedicated to building a unified, national telephone system, quickly became the pragmatist, preferring to accept government oversight on grounds acceptable to AT&amp;amp;T rather than risk losing the fight and having terms dictated by politicians. In AT&amp;amp;T’s 1907 Annual Report, Vail wrote, as if negotiating:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is not believed that there is any objection to [public control] provided it is independent, intelligent, considerate, thorough and just, recognizing, as does the Interstate Commerce Commission…that capital is entitled to fair return and good management or enterprise to its reward.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc384&quot; href=&quot;#fn384&quot;&gt;384&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being innovated was a privately-owned and managed, publicly-regulated, national telecommunications monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The states were asserting their roles as well by legislating public utility commissions. At this same time, AT&amp;amp;T was wrestling once again with the question: How should it be organized? Since state boundaries had been but one consideration used in granting licensee contracts, AT&amp;amp;T now represented a hodgepodge of geographically-based licensees which needed to be coordinated into collective behavior. (The various States also had different institutions, such as corporate or commercial law, that incented, or disincented, economic behavior.) In 1907, eight states had passed laws regulating telecommunications – the telephone and telegraph systems. By year-end 1911, fourteen more states vested authority with public-utility commissions to regulate telecommunications. Throughout these years, AT&amp;amp;T tried various strategies of incorporating state boundaries into AT&amp;amp;T organizational units, both compatible and, to thwart regulation, incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1909, AT&amp;amp;T acted to consolidate all the licensees of the state of New York into one legal organization – the New York Telephone Company (NYTC). Simultaneous with the reorganization, AT&amp;amp;T decided NYTC needed to raise money; however, WU which owned a third of NYTC could not fund its pro rata share and sold its ownership to AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc385&quot; href=&quot;#fn385&quot;&gt;385&lt;/a&gt; A few months later, AT&amp;amp;T bought a controlling interest in WU from George J. Gould, son of Jay the Robber Baron, and his associates. In 1910, Vail was elected President of WU, while remaining President of AT&amp;amp;T – the company that had given him his first full-time job. Vail strongly believed in the synergies between the telephone and telegraph, and quite contrary to what outsiders presumed, Vail began investing both management and capital into WU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that AT&amp;amp;T always played fair, for they didn’t. Raising havoc with the efforts of the independents, and long distance competition to gain access to capital, and thus the funds needed to grow, was a typical ploy. Morgan and other friendly investment and commercial bankers were silently buying up independents in the Midwest with the intent to sell them to AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc386&quot; href=&quot;#fn386&quot;&gt;386&lt;/a&gt; AT&amp;amp;T acted aggressively, and the competitors didn’t like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1910, Congress reacted to the clamor for government legislation and held hearings on whether to regulate the telephone. The authority of Congress and the Federal Government came from the 1877 Supreme Court decision, Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union, which ruled telegraph communications, and by extension the telephone, between states was interstate commerce. Vail, now prepared to accept, even want, regulation if it meant no new competition, he testified:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now the telegraph line and the telephone line are becoming rapidly as much a part of the instruments of commerce and as much a necessity in commercial life as the railroads.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc387&quot; href=&quot;#fn387&quot;&gt;387&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Congress passed the Mann-Elkins Act which gave the ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission) authority to regulate telephone communication rates, undertake property valuations, and prescribe uniform accounts and financial reports.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc388&quot; href=&quot;#fn388&quot;&gt;388&lt;/a&gt; However, legislation was a long ways from any, let alone effective, regulation. Hence, negotiations continued. Vail in the Annual Report of 1910 wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bellsystem was founded on broad lines of One System, One Policy, Universal Service, on the idea that no aggregation of isolated independent systems not under common control, however well built or equipped, could give the country the service. One system with a common policy, common purposes and common action; comprehensive, universal, interdependent, intercommunicating like the highway system of the country, extending from every door to every other door, affording electrical communication of every kind, from every one at every place to every one at every other place.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc389&quot; href=&quot;#fn389&quot;&gt;389&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vail also wrote he wanted Bell to be operated as an end-to-end service with no foreign attachments, i.e. other manufacturer telephones.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc390&quot; href=&quot;#fn390&quot;&gt;390&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice, no doubt emboldened by the Standard Oil and American Tobacco Supreme Court decisions of 1911, began an investigation of AT&amp;amp;T to determine if it should file an antitrust suit. On January 7, 1913, Attorney-General Wickersham addressed a letter to Charles A. Prouty, Chairman of the ICC, requesting an investigation of the rates and practices of the telephone companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc391&quot; href=&quot;#fn391&quot;&gt;391&lt;/a&gt; The ICC agreed. But by July 1913, AT&amp;amp;T’s aggressive behavior of consolidating and acquiring, or otherwise eliminating, competition had become too much. (Between 1907 and 1912, the market share of independents fell from 48.8 percent to 41.7 percent nationally, while the percentage of non-Bell firms connected to the AT&amp;amp;T network increased dramatically from 26.6 percent to 63.5 percent.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc392&quot; href=&quot;#fn392&quot;&gt;392&lt;/a&gt; ) When AT&amp;amp;T acted to buy a long distance company in Oregon, the Justice Department under the newly elected Woodrow Wilson, filed an antitrust suit in the Federal District Court of Oregon. In November, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson published a report advocating government ownership of the national telephone system, with a long excerpt read into the Congressional Record in December.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc393&quot; href=&quot;#fn393&quot;&gt;393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on December 19, 1913, Nathan C. Kingsbury, an AT&amp;amp;T first vice president, wrote a defining letter to Attorney General James C. McReynolds. (See Appendix 2.6 Kingsbury Letter.) In sharp contravention to then current policy, AT&amp;amp;T agreed to cease buying competitive telephone companies without prior Department of Justice approval and to provide standard trunk lines to Independent exchanges; where standard assumed the Bell telephone. It also agreed to sell its ownership in Western Union.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc394&quot; href=&quot;#fn394&quot;&gt;394&lt;/a&gt; Thus, an out-of-court agreement with the Justice Department had been reached, settling the antitrust suit. President Wilson expressed pleasure that AT&amp;amp;T: should thus volunteer to adjust its business to the conditions of competition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc395&quot; href=&quot;#fn395&quot;&gt;395&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T had effectively accepted regulation, and the Government had sanctioned the then existing AT&amp;amp;T as not in violation of the Sherman Act. Institution working – antitrust - and institution changing -what antitust meant for and with AT&amp;amp;T. And so came to a close Bell’s second era of competition. Now, AT&amp;amp;T and the independents were to work together to bring about a national telephone system. However, AT&amp;amp;T was not to be denied so easily – Vail had embedded the logic, and imperative, of one grand system too deeply into the culture and people of AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s intentions to be the one grand national system had been but momentarily slowed by the Kingsbury Commitment –the agreement of regulation and not to acquire independents. In his 1914 annual report, the Attorney General clarified his interpretation of the Commitment to allow for the consolidation of local exchange competition into their natural state of monopolies, even if involving a Bell.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc399&quot; href=&quot;#fn399&quot;&gt;399&lt;/a&gt; This qualification gave AT&amp;amp;T the interpretive room to continue consolidating. In 1917, the rule was reinterpreted again; this time to allow AT&amp;amp;T to acquire competitive independents as long as they sold as many stations back to other independents as they were acquiring. (See Exhibit 2.15 AT&amp;amp;T’s Consolidation Quest.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior under the new rule had hardly begun, when the exigencies of World War I prompted the Federal Government to take control of AT&amp;amp;T and all other telecommunication companies on August 1, 1918. In what will be Vail’s last, and maybe greatest, contribution, he managed what appeared going in to be a cold and acrimonious relationship with the Attorney General into one that assured the return of AT&amp;amp;T to its private shareholders – far from a foregone conclusion since there were many who wanted the government to retain control and management of the telephone system.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc400&quot; href=&quot;#fn400&quot;&gt;400&lt;/a&gt; During the year of oversight, the Federal Government began doing just what AT&amp;amp;T had wanted to do – consolidate companies into one system. Vail’s prodigious efforts during the War, when he was already an exhausted and ailing man, were more than even a constitution as strong as his could bear, and on April 16, 1920, Vail, the man who made AT&amp;amp;T into what will become the largest corporation in the world, passed away.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc401&quot; href=&quot;#fn401&quot;&gt;401&lt;/a&gt; Edison, in 1912, had said it most succinctly: Vail was a big man.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc402&quot; href=&quot;#fn402&quot;&gt;402&lt;/a&gt; Then, just two years later, on August 2, 1922, Graham, the original legendary figure of AT&amp;amp;T, died. What these two historical giants left mankind remained a far cry from the transformative technology it was destined to become, yet even so, they had the genius to understand its potential from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now the logic of consolidation had proved too compelling, not just for AT&amp;amp;T, but for all participants, including those independents who now wanted to sell their companies to Bell. (AT&amp;amp;T had eliminated so many independents in so many key locations, that the competitive threat of another national company was thought impossible, so the independents were brought to the firesale condition AT&amp;amp;T had sought all along.) In 1921, Congress passed the Willis-Graham Act giving telephone companies the right to consolidate, subject to prior approval of state authorities and the ICC. – the ICC had been given authority over mergers and acquisitions. This new authority reflected the changed philosophy of competition which thought consolidation the natural, and inevitable, course of economic development. The Kingsbury Commitment was declared ended, no longer effective.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc403&quot; href=&quot;#fn403&quot;&gt;403&lt;/a&gt; From 1921 to 1934, the ICC approved 271 of 274 acquisitions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc404&quot; href=&quot;#fn404&quot;&gt;404&lt;/a&gt; (By year-end 1921, AT&amp;amp;T had corporate assets of $1 billion.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-215-atts-consolidation-quest&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.15 AT&amp;amp;T’s Consolidation Quest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

(2) for the years 1914 to 1927, inclusive, purchases and sales of company (for 1921, company and service) stations in connection with purchases and sales of “going or completed plant;” (3) for the year1928, purchases and sales of company stations in connection with the purchase or sale of plant involving in any one transaction a consideration of $10,000 or more and each purchase or sale involving an entire company or exchange regardless of amount involved; (4) for the years 1929 to 1934, inclusive, purchases and sales of company stations in connection with the purchase or sale of the entire property of a company, or where an entire exchange is involved, or where telephone plant is purchased or sold involving a consideration exceeding $10,000 and the business handled over such plant is transferred by the selling company to the purchasing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foregoing data do not include (1) purchases and sales between Bell System companies; (2) purchases and sales by Bell-controlled companies from or to companies other that Bell associated companies: (3) corrections of reports of previous years and transactions reported in year following that in which consummated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the formal change in the institutional rules of regulation due to the Willis-Graham Act, the informal constraints, those arising from the interactions of the participants, also saw change. In 1921, AT&amp;amp;T bought 157,337 stations from Independents while selling them only 43,960 stations. The Independents voiced alarmed over such aggressive behavior, and to head off any adverse reactions, AT&amp;amp;T sent F. B. McKinnon, President of the United States Independent Telephone Association, a letter on June 22, 1922 stating AT&amp;amp;T’s acquisition philosophy – no acquisitions or consolidations would be made unless demanded for the convenience of the public or, in essence, in the interests of AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc405&quot; href=&quot;#fn405&quot;&gt;405&lt;/a&gt; Known as the Hall Memorandum, it pacified the Independents, while probably not changing AT&amp;amp;T’s behavior, but it did indicate that AT&amp;amp;T wanted to maintain friendly relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1924, AT&amp;amp;T once again reorganized its research and development activities and created Bell Laboratories; owned equally by AT&amp;amp;T and WE. (Bell Labs would become the most important and prolific corporate research laboratory of its time.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc406&quot; href=&quot;#fn406&quot;&gt;406&lt;/a&gt; ) This restructuring also produced the AT&amp;amp;T organization that would persist until the 1980’s. (See Exhibit 2.16 AT&amp;amp;T Organization Chart.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-216-att-organization-chart&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.16 AT&amp;amp;T Organization Chart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-16-att-organization-chart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.16 AT&amp;amp;T Organization Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 31, 1927, AT&amp;amp;T radically changed its license contract. It sold all telephone instruments to the licensees and reduced its license fee from now 4 to 2 percent.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc407&quot; href=&quot;#fn407&quot;&gt;407&lt;/a&gt; The purchase price to the licensees was $38.2 million, $14.4 million greater than AT&amp;amp;T’s depreciated book value – the original purchase price had been $46.5 million. (At the time, AT&amp;amp;T’s total plant and equipment totalled over $200 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc408&quot; href=&quot;#fn408&quot;&gt;408&lt;/a&gt; ) Virtually all the telephones sold were ones that had transmitters and receivers incompatible with those of the new, standard telephone instruments AT&amp;amp;T had put into production by 1927 – the desk model had a one-handle design. The licensees had bought assets that were soon obsolete, reinforcing the culture of wanting no changes in the periphery of the network, i.e., telephone instruments. Furthermore, instrument concerns and responsibilities had been shifted to the licensees, with AT&amp;amp;T undoubtedly preferring not to deal with instrument issues, since if conflict emerged, they would have to assume the compromising role of mediator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T was having its way. So much so in fact, that in 1927, President Walter S. Gifford, who became President in 1925, seemed to modify Vail’s One Policy, One System, Universal Service,” when he stated the goal of the Bell System was: to furnish the best possible service at the lowest possible cost consistent with financial safety.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc409&quot; href=&quot;#fn409&quot;&gt;409&lt;/a&gt; How prescient, however, for it would be the Great Depression of 1929-1936 that would instigate the next convulsive twist in the history of telecommunications in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;President Franklin Delanor Roosevelt and the “New Deal” Congress were elected into office in 1932 with the mandate to use the power of government to escape the grips of the Great Depression. Corporate capitalism was seen to have run its course, and a new means of creating economic growth was needed. One way was for the Federal Government to exercise its power and pass legislation regulating certain “public service” industries – those where the polity had retained, or was thought needed to have, institutional presence. A Congressional Investigative Committee reported in 1934 on the telephone and telecommunications industries that “at the present time there is little, if any, Federal regulation of the rates, practices, and charges of the several branches of the communications industry.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc410&quot; href=&quot;#fn410&quot;&gt;410&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The importance of the (telephone) industry calls for actual and not nominal regulation. Telephone business is a monopoly – it is supposed to be regulated. Thus far regulation, particularly by the Federal Government, has been nominal largely because Congress has not made appropriations sufficient to enable the Interstate Commerce Commission to give effect to existing statutes.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc411&quot; href=&quot;#fn411&quot;&gt;411&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early February, various bills to create a new regulatory commission for communications had been proposed in both Houses of Congress.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc412&quot; href=&quot;#fn412&quot;&gt;412&lt;/a&gt; After President Roosevelt went public with support for such legislation on February 26, bills were introduced in both Houses the following day. President Gifford of AT&amp;amp;T immediately objected to provisions giving the Federal Communication Commision (FCC) power to void or modify contracts by carriers (“goes almost the whole way toward substituting public management in place of public regulation”), to approve all equipment or service exchanges among parent and subsidiaries, and to require carriers to solicit competitive bids for all equipment and service purchases (“revolutionary”).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc413&quot; href=&quot;#fn413&quot;&gt;413&lt;/a&gt;] After months of negotiations and behind-door intrigue, the proposal for a Congressional study of communications, read AT&amp;amp;T, was dropped and AT&amp;amp;T stopped protesting. On July 11, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc414&quot; href=&quot;#fn414&quot;&gt;414&lt;/a&gt; The two principle objectives were: lower costs, and “universal service” – a phone for everyone.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc415&quot; href=&quot;#fn415&quot;&gt;415&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Act did not require extended debate, after all Congress was simply trying to take the historical record of communications regulation and vest it in a dedicated administrative agency. In fact, the agency was not new, but simply an enlarged Federal Radio Commission (FRC); created by the Radio Act of 1927. In essence, the Act took the language and concepts first codified in the ICA of 1887, and as changed over time, merged them with the Radio Act, and gave them to a renamed, and slightly changed, agency – the Federal Communications Commission (FCC): (“..for the purpose of securing a more effective execution of this policy by centralizing authority heretofore granted by law to several agencies..”). Thus did the metaphor of transportation become formally embedded in the language of telecommunications regulation. No longer would communications regulation have to be squeezed into the busy agenda of the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC consists of commissioners appointed by the President and responsible to Congress.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc416&quot; href=&quot;#fn416&quot;&gt;416&lt;/a&gt; The commissioners are supported by a number of bureaus that develop, recommend and perfect regulation on behalf of the commissioners who approve their actions by vote. The Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) is the bureau responsible for telephone, or “common carrier,” regulation – Title II regulation in the Act. A common carrier is “any person engaged as common carrier for hire, in interstate or foreign communications by wire or radio or in interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy” (excluding radio broadcasting).”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc417&quot; href=&quot;#fn417&quot;&gt;417&lt;/a&gt; All FCC decisions are subject to appellate review, and the courts can reverse any decision when it thinks the FCC has exceeded the authority granted to it under the Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key provisions of the Act are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(a) Entry and exit authority (Section 214 Authority);&lt;br /&gt;(b) Tariff filing and reasonable rate requirements;&lt;br /&gt;(c) Nondiscrimination in providing service and interconnection to other carriers upon reasonable request;&lt;br /&gt;(d) Financial reporting, record keeping, and regulatory accounting requirements;&lt;br /&gt;(e) Complaint procedures.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc418&quot; href=&quot;#fn418&quot;&gt;418&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislation had proceeded quickly for many of the thorniest issues had been slated for three FCC investigations: intercompany transactions which might affect services and charges,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc419&quot; href=&quot;#fn419&quot;&gt;419&lt;/a&gt; the relationships between and among telephone and telegraph companies, and exclusive contracts by telegraph companies to furnish service in public places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first investigation was known as the Special Telephone Investigation (STI) and was led by the newly appointed Commissioner with telephone experience – Paul A. Walker. Walker chose to conduct the investigation as a Congressional investigation, and did not allow AT&amp;amp;T to introduce their own, or to cross-examine any, witnesses.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc420&quot; href=&quot;#fn420&quot;&gt;420&lt;/a&gt; After nearly two years of hearings and fact collecting, the STI was concluded in June 1937. Then in 1938, in an unusual move, Walker issued a Proposed Report, one very critical of AT&amp;amp;T and recommending such actions as direct regulation of WE’s prices, and competitive bidding all purchases. The frosty relations between Walker, and to a lesser extent the FCC, and AT&amp;amp;T had just turned considerably colder. AT&amp;amp;T tried to counter Walker’s Proposed Report with a point-by-point public rebuttal, and behind the scenes lobbying with the other Commissioners. The FCC issued its Report on the Investigation of the Telephone Industry in the United States in June 1939; it became known as the Walker Report. It had white-washed the more controversial points and proved to be a dud – no legislation, the ostensible objective, resulted. Neither did it gain much press, as the building drama of World War II had absorbed the public’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When Harry S. Truman surprised the experts and won election in 1948, he finally felt free, unencumbered as the Roosevelt stand-in, to make the Administration over with people who believed as he did, including the aggressive use of antitrust to save the economy for competition. Monopolies were the enemy. And AT&amp;amp;T, the biggest of them all, had escaped the leveling cleaver of antitrust. Or so believed Holmes Baldridge who became the new chief of the Antitrust Division’s General Litigation Section. Baldridge had harbored for years the frustrations of not seeing the conclusions of the STI investigation of the 1930’s implemented – an investigation of which he had served as chief counsel.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc421&quot; href=&quot;#fn421&quot;&gt;421&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Baldridge needed new justification, he had it handed to him on December 22, 1948, when the Hush-A-Phone Corporation (HAPC) filed a complaint with the FCC against AT&amp;amp;T, charging that its Foreign Attachment Tariff Restrictions prohibited telephone subscribers from using its product – the Hush-A-Phone. The Hush-A-Phone, available since 1929, was simply a plastic cup that fit over the telephone microphone to increase the privacy of telephone conversations and reduce extraneous noise. As innocent as it would seem, AT&amp;amp;T and the Bell operating companies viewed the Foreign Attachment Tariff Restrictions as banning not only electrical interconnection of devices to the telephone network, but any type of physical attachment of anything to a facility, up to and including a plastic cover on a telephone book in a public phone kiosk.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc422&quot; href=&quot;#fn422&quot;&gt;422&lt;/a&gt; In place since 1911, the Tariff read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Equipment, apparatus and lines furnished by the Telephone Company shall be carefully used and no equipment, apparatus of lines not furnished by the Telephone Company shall be attached to, or used in connection therewith, unless specifically authorized in this tariff.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc423&quot; href=&quot;#fn423&quot;&gt;423&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 14, 1949, the Truman Justice Department filed a civil antitrust suit against AT&amp;amp;T and its manufacturing subsidiary WE – United States v. Western Electric. The Justice Department charged that the two companies had established a monopoly in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of telephone equipment. It asked the court to divest AT&amp;amp;T of WE and split WE into three separate companies, to force WE to sell its 50 percent interest in Bell Labs to AT&amp;amp;T, to require AT&amp;amp;T to competitively bid all purchases, and to license its patents to all applicants. Despite the facts that AT&amp;amp;T’s financial performance deteriorating, and a just completed investigation by the California PUC had concluded that WE prices were 45 percent below an average of Independent manufacturers prices,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc424&quot; href=&quot;#fn424&quot;&gt;424&lt;/a&gt; the Justice Department, that is Baldridge, was not going to be confused. AT&amp;amp;T was a monopoly and needed to be broken-up.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc425&quot; href=&quot;#fn425&quot;&gt;425&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 14, 1949, Jordaphone Corporation of American (JCA) and Mohawk Business Machines Corporation (MBMC) added fuel to the fire, jointly filing a formal complaint with the FCC against AT&amp;amp;T, charging its foreign attachment tariffs prohibited telephone subscribers from using telephone answering devices they manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC held hearings on both the HAPC and joint JCA and MBMC cases in 1950. In the Case of HAPC, AT&amp;amp;T argued, among other things, that: “Well, you know, the Hush-A-Phone distorts speech, and any one of 200 million people in this country might be called by, or might call, someone using a Hush-A-Phone. They’re going to get a lousy telephone call. That’s harm. They’re not getting what they paid for.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc426&quot; href=&quot;#fn426&quot;&gt;426&lt;/a&gt; In the JCA and MBMC case, AT&amp;amp;T argued, among other things, that the devices in question could accidentally leave a circuit open, and since no other telephone call could then be put through, harm resulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 16, 1951, the FCC released its initial decision on the HAPC case – dismissal in favor of AT&amp;amp;T. HAPC petitioned for review to the Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were scheduled for November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 13, 1951, the FCC released its initial decision in JCA and MBMC – dismissal in favor of AT&amp;amp;T. JCA and MBMC petitioned for review to the Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were scheduled for June 1952&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Truman Administration’s Justice Department, even though constrained by the lack of funds and thus staff, continued filing antitrust suits – thirty of them.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc427&quot; href=&quot;#fn427&quot;&gt;427&lt;/a&gt; On January 21, 1952, one was filed against International Business Machines (IBM) which constituted approximately 90% of the highly visible punch card business. (As a consequence, government tried to restructure the leading firms in both industries that would converge to give rise and context to computer communications. These would not be the last monopoly suits the Justice Department would file against either AT&amp;amp;T or IBM.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The election of Dwight D. Eisenhower President in 1952 brought to antitrust enforcement a more conservative, pro-business philosophy. Stanley N. Barnes, the new Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, sought to resolve as many of the 144 active antitrust cases he inherited as quickly as possible.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc428&quot; href=&quot;#fn428&quot;&gt;428&lt;/a&gt; In April and July, private meetings among AT&amp;amp;T and Justice Department personnel were held. Justice Department people suggested they were willing to abandon their efforts to divest AT&amp;amp;T of WE, and to settle out-of-court, via a consent decree. Only they needed something in return, to save face, and to counter the perception that they were being soft on monopolies. (A consent decree would be an important concession for it did not mandate treble damages in outstanding private antitrust suits, as a court decision against AT&amp;amp;T would.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the months passed, AT&amp;amp;T successfully marshaled Department of Defense (DOD) support for their cause, with DOD personnel lobbying Barnes for case dismissal. AT&amp;amp;T had become indispensable to the DOD, building missiles, managing Sandia National Laboratories, and soon to receive a major contract for the SAGE Project. AT&amp;amp;T had persuaded the DOD that divesting AT&amp;amp;T of WE, and then sub-dividing WE, was sure to impact its ability to meet and respond to critical national security requirements. So new ideas and new conditions left AT&amp;amp;T knowing they could survive intact, that is if they could find a face-saving compromise for the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 1954, the Court deciding the JAC case issued its final decision. It ruled in favor of AT&amp;amp;T – JAC’s telephone answering devices need not be tariffed. But, reflecting the uncertain division of jurisdictional responsibilities between the FCC and the state PUC’s, if a PUC tariffed the use of telephone answering devices, then the JAC device had to be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antitrust negotiations that had begun in the Spring of 1953 between the Justice Department and AT&amp;amp;T had now dragged on for over two years. In the Fall of 1955, the Justice Department solicited FCC advice on the issues of the antitrust suit. A first response was prepared by the chief of the CCB. The Commissioners thought it too weak in representing FCC powers, and sent it back for redrafting. The job was assigned to CCB staff lawyer Bernard Strassburg.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc429&quot; href=&quot;#fn429&quot;&gt;429&lt;/a&gt; He wrote of the Commission’s powers to examine rate bases and to take appropriate actions; pointing out rate reductions that had been negotiated. He also wrote two other paragraphs, paragraphs that were deleted in the response passed on by the Commissioners. One paragraph dealt with the simple fact that they did not know if WE’s prices were as low as they might be in a competitive market. The second recognized that the FCC’s powers depended on the resources they had – inferring they did not have enough – one of the issues that had prompted the creation of the FCC in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independently, on December 21, 1955, Judge David Bazelon handed down the Court decision on the Hush-A-Phone case. Judge Bazelon reasoned that since the same effect of the Hush-A-Phone plastic cup could be created by cupping one’s hands around the microphone, such a tariff was an:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;unwarrented interference with the telephone subscriber’s right reasonably to use his telephone in ways which are privately beneficial without being publicly detrimental. Prescribing what changes should be made in the tariffs to render them just, fair, and reasonable and determining what orders may be required to prohibit violation of subscribers rights thereunder are functions entrusted to the Commission.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc430&quot; href=&quot;#fn430&quot;&gt;430&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another lingering issue was about to be decided, for the burst of activity in December between the Justice Department and AT&amp;amp;T led to the announcement on January 24, 1956 that an out-of-court settlement of U. S. v. Western Electric had been reached. By terms of the agreement, AT&amp;amp;T:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Did not have to divest itself of Western Electric,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Was enjoined and restrained from engaging….in any business otherthan the furnishing of common carrier communications services,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc431&quot; href=&quot;#fn431&quot;&gt;431&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Was required to license Bell patents to any applicant that agreed to paya reasonable royalty and agreed to make available their patents to Bell,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc432&quot; href=&quot;#fn432&quot;&gt;432&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Western Electric could not manufacturing equipment other than that used by the Bell System, or the Government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T had again foiled the Federal Government’s efforts to introduce competition into telecommunications. In essence, no one was willing to risk the uncertainty of what might happen if AT&amp;amp;T were forced to do what it steadfastly resisted; and not without reason, for not only had AT&amp;amp;T created the world’s finest telephone system, but as the world’s largest corporation, any negative impact to its hundreds of thousands of employees and shareholders would certainly have political consequences. So the Justice Department did what it could to prevent the monopolist from interfering with other, competitively-determined, markets, and constrained AT&amp;amp;T, and WE, to common carrier communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T had also fought off the efforts by other companies to connect non-AT&amp;amp;T devices to their network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc433&quot; href=&quot;#fn433&quot;&gt;433&lt;/a&gt; Granted their tariffs had to be just, fair, and reasonable, but who was to say what those words meant other than AT&amp;amp;T; and challenging AT&amp;amp;T’s interpretations had proven lengthy, and expensive, with little hope the FCC would rule against AT&amp;amp;T. The tradition of fighting any changes at the periphery of the network, a tradition dating to the 19th century, had again proven successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the world of telecommunications as AT&amp;amp;T had walled itself away, steeled against change, seemingly harmonious with the pace of the 1950’s, but soon to be at odds with the great changes to be introduced by computers.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By 1965, the convergence – and potential conflict – between common carrier communications and computers began making an impression on Strassburg, Chief of the CCB of the FCC since 1963. He would write later of how he then viewed the relationship between AT&amp;amp;T and the FCC: “It was truly a symbiotic relationship. The regulated monopoly operated in what was considered to be the public interest and, in turn, was shielded against incursions by rivals and competitors, including the possibility of government ownership.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc434&quot; href=&quot;#fn434&quot;&gt;434&lt;/a&gt; He had reason to be satisfied, for interstate rates, a key measure of FCC effectiveness, had been consistently declining. Even so, Strassburg couldn’t get out of his head what Dr. Manley Irwin, a young economist on his staff, kept telling him – computer users wanted to use the telephone system in ways AT&amp;amp;T had consistently fought. Strassburg recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I, in 1965, assembled a task force, a small group of staff members to sort of take an overview of the various dimensions of data communications; what the problems seemed to be, if any, and what we should do about them.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc435&quot; href=&quot;#fn435&quot;&gt;435&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bunker-Ramo Corporation (BRC) gave the task force immediate relevance when it announced Telequote IV.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc436&quot; href=&quot;#fn436&quot;&gt;436&lt;/a&gt; BRC wanted to offer computer services to brokerage firms that would allow branch offices to send stock quotes, transactions, and messages to central computers and terminals located in other branches. WU and AT&amp;amp;T, BRC’s common carriers, refused to provide the private lines needed to implement their system; arguing that BRC wanted to provide message switching services which they could not do under existing common carrier tariffs, and to do so, they would become subject to regulation under the Act of 1934. (Fighting the combination of common carriers, the FCC and PUC’s proved exhausting, and facing little hope of success, BRC in February 1966 introduced a modified Telequote service.) BRC’s frustrations were far from unique, as the task force was quickly learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1966, the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, referred a case to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to resolve questions of whether the tariff permitting telephone companies to suspend, or terminate, service if non-AT&amp;amp;T devices were connected to telephone company facilities was valid. Once again it was the issue of foreign attachments, and the case was: Thomas F. Carter and Carter Electronics Corporation v. American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph Company et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his friends, Tom Carter was a practical man, an inventor and entrepreneur. But a David about to get the best of Goliath, never. Carter’s innovation was motivated by the simple desire to solve the communication problem of oil field workers, far from phones, maybe aboard an off-shore oil-rig, trying to reach home. Or to get a message to their office. “We’ve struck oil!” Carter’s clever kludge – the Carterfone&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc437&quot; href=&quot;#fn437&quot;&gt;437&lt;/a&gt; – was hardly a lightning rod it will to prove to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Carterfone was simply a mobile radio that was connected acoustically, or inductively, to the telephone network. (See Exhibit 2.17 - The Carterfone) Without any electrical connection or wiring or physical attachment, an incoming telephone call activated a two-way radio connection which permitted the telephone caller to communicate with someone using the radio system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-217---the-carterfone&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.17 - The Carterfone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-17-the-carterfone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.17 The Carterfone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Carter first introduced the Carterfone in 1959, he had been surprised to learn that the telephone company held the Carterfone could not be connected to the telephone network – it interfered with their end-to-end service responsibility and could be harmful to telephone service. Furthermore, it violated the tariffs banning foreign attachment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc438&quot; href=&quot;#fn438&quot;&gt;438&lt;/a&gt; Carter was not so easily discouraged, and by 1966 had sold approximately 3,500 Carterfones in the United States and overseas. Nevertheless, the Bell System or General Telephone threatening to terminate customers telephone service posed a real obstacle to sales, so in 1966, Carter brought an antitrust suit against the Bell System and the General Telephone Company of the Southwest.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc439&quot; href=&quot;#fn439&quot;&gt;439&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at the FCC, the Carterfone case was referred to the CCB where it received scant attention. Understandably so, since the CCB already had an extremely busy agenda, including: the first ever general rate inquiry of AT&amp;amp;T, begun in 1965; the Telpak tariff controversy, initiated in 1961 (this issue alone will take twenty years to resolve); a request by Microwave Communications, Inc. (MCI) for a license to offer common carrier services between St. Louis and Chicago in competition with AT&amp;amp;T, filed in 1963; the just launched domestic satellite inquiry; and the task force looking at the issues of computers and communications. Hearings to collect information for the MCI and Carterfone cases were scheduled for 1967.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc440&quot; href=&quot;#fn440&quot;&gt;440&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Strassburg was coming to the opinion that: “Few products of modern technology have as much potential for social, economic, and cultural benefit as does the multiple access computer.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc441&quot; href=&quot;#fn441&quot;&gt;441&lt;/a&gt; Knowing he had to educate the Commissioners to the needs of computers, he contacted the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc442&quot; href=&quot;#fn442&quot;&gt;442&lt;/a&gt; to give a series of lectures to the Commissioners. One of the lecturers was Paul Baran, who was known to Strassburg, and as future chapters will make clear, a dominant figure in the history of computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg began publicly airing his opinions. On October 20, 1966, he gave a speech to an audience of computer professionals in which he identified three unresolved issues in the coming convergence of computers and common carrier communications: who could compete in what businesses – the issue of market entry; communication line costs; and information privacy. He also clarified his understanding of the responsibilities and roles of the FCC, or Commission, as well as their responsiveness to the issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Commission is not indifferent to these concerns. On the contrary, the matters involved are the subjects of our active study with a view to determining the respects in which the tariff offerings of the carriers may fall short of meeting, on a just and reasonable basis, the communication requirements of the data processing industry. For the Commission is obliged by the policies and the objectives of the Communications Act to ensure that the nation’s communication network is responsive to the requirements of an advancing technology. The Commission has the obligation, the authority, and the means to reappraise and refashion any established policies in order to promote the public interest through an effective realization of the social and economic benefits of current technology.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc443&quot; href=&quot;#fn443&quot;&gt;443&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg’s speech served as but a warm-up for the announcement on November 9 that the FCC would hold a public inquiry titled: Notice of Inquiry, In the Matter of Regulatory and Policy Problems Presented by the Interdependence of Computer and Communications Services and Facilities (Docket F.C.C. No. 16979). Strassburg remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I decided that we ought to formalize this thing. We sensed enough ferment out there, or enough concern, to say: ‘Well, look we’re going to encounter some problems here, and let’s get on top of them sooner, rather than later, and for once let a regulatory agency be out in front, rather than trying to shovel up the mess that’s left behind.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc444&quot; href=&quot;#fn444&quot;&gt;444&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsure if they had captured all the salient issues, the CCB first circulated a draft of the Notice. Hoping to learn how the fast growing data processing industry wanted to use the telephone system, as well as how data processing firms viewed AT&amp;amp;T offering data processing services,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc445&quot; href=&quot;#fn445&quot;&gt;445&lt;/a&gt; the Notice read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are confronted with determining under what circumstances data processing, computer information, and message switching services, or any particular combination thereof–whether engaged in by established common carriers or other entities–are or should be subject to the provisions of the Communications Act.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc446&quot; href=&quot;#fn446&quot;&gt;446&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1967, H. I. Romnes became AT&amp;amp;T’s new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc447&quot; href=&quot;#fn447&quot;&gt;447&lt;/a&gt; Romnes did not fully subscribe to AT&amp;amp;T’s long standing policy opposing foreign attachments. Shortly after taking office, he expressed the opinion that Bell’s responsibility for the network could be maintained if there were used suitable interfaces or buffer devices to keep the attached equipment from affecting other users of the network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc448&quot; href=&quot;#fn448&quot;&gt;448&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over forty organizations responded to the draft Notice, including AT&amp;amp;T, IBM, Bunker-Ramo and WU.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc449&quot; href=&quot;#fn449&quot;&gt;449&lt;/a&gt; The comments raised no new issues, so the Notice was reissued on March 1, 1967, with final comments requested by October 2, 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MCI hearings began in February and lasted nine weeks. The Carterfone hearings were scheduled next, for April.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc450&quot; href=&quot;#fn450&quot;&gt;450&lt;/a&gt; Fred Henck, Editor of Telecommunications Reports,one of the most respected trade publications of the time, would comment later that it was hard to find someone to report on these two insignificant cases, referred to around the office as the cats and dogs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc451&quot; href=&quot;#fn451&quot;&gt;451&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg, on the other hand, began to see the Carterfone as a way to revisit the foreign attachments tariff, which, as he was increasingly learning, was a real impediment to data processing use of the telephone system and to innovation of communication devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We used the Carterfone issue and the Carterfone proceeding as a vehicle for revisiting the basic policy, which was basically a Bell System policy, which had been embraced by the FCC and the regulatory commissions for many generations, against customers, willy-nilly, interconnecting anything they chose to the telephone network, no matter how innocuous it might be unless the item was specifically authorized by the telephone company’s tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, the telephone company wasn’t likely to tariff anything of consequence, so as a result, anytime anybody wanted to promote a piece of equipment and to have it work with the telephone network, they either had to sell it to the Bell System, if they could convince Western Electric and Bell that they had something sellable, or if they couldn’t succeed in that channel, then attacking the tariff insofar as the claim was unlawful – and that the Commission should order it amended in order to accommodate their device. But that was a very cumbersome process to go through; the administrative hearing and the time and the cost involved that, to a small entrepreneur with a piece of equipment – it discouraged people. It discouraged the market from developing, and that’s why, I think, the United States was so far behind other countries, because, in terms of customer-premise equipment, simply because there was no entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurship was blunted and discouraged by this institutionalized practice of saying: “You can’t connect with us.” In other words, everything that went on had to go on within the Bell System, Bell Laboratories.That was where innovation began and ended.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc452&quot; href=&quot;#fn452&quot;&gt;452&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came time to argue the Carterfone case before the Hearing Examiner, Chester F. Naumowicz, Jr., the CCB took the position that the tariff provisions limiting use of customer-provided equipment be canceled. Replaced, instead, with a tariff provision that ‘clearly and affirmatively states…that customer-provided equipment, apparatus, circuits, or devices may be attached or connected to the telephones furnished by the telephone company in the message toll telephone service for any purpose that is privately beneficial to the customer and not publicly detrimental.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc453&quot; href=&quot;#fn453&quot;&gt;453&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCB was not arguing that users could substitute customer-provided equipment for that provided by the telephone company, only that it should be permissible to connect or attach devices to telephones furnished by the telephone company.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc454&quot; href=&quot;#fn454&quot;&gt;454&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T was not alone in fighting the liberalization of foreign attachments. For example, the National Association of Regulatory and Utility Commissioners (NARUC) testified that a ruling against AT&amp;amp;T would cause a tremendous rise in administrative costs and force changes to existing tariffs. Individual state PUC’s also testified in support of AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc455&quot; href=&quot;#fn455&quot;&gt;455&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Carterfone hearings took but seven days. Maybe sensing a fundamental change in progress, Romnes assembled a high-level Tariff Review Committee to conceive alternative interconnection tariffs that would protect the network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc456&quot; href=&quot;#fn456&quot;&gt;456&lt;/a&gt; The facts that AT&amp;amp;T permitted connection of foreign attachments by the military and government, as well as equipment of TV networks, all suggested there had to be a solution other than total prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1967, Examiner Naumowicz, issued his initial decision. Ignoring the argument for a broad policy change, he ruled narrowly that harm from use of the Carterfone had not been proven: ‘We here consider on a specific device and the evidence as to what, if any, effect it will have on the system.’“&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc457&quot; href=&quot;#fn457&quot;&gt;457&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the Fall, responses to the Notice of Inquiry were pouring into the FCC. It was as if a sensitive nerve had been struck, and the press could not get enough of it. An already burdened CCB saw thousands of pages of input and exhibits piling up, ever impossible to ignore, especially with the Commissioners relishing their new found popularity and kudos for public leadership. As CCB staffers began leafing through the materials, two subjects came up again and again: the prohibition on foreign attachments were unduly restrictive, and telephone rate structures were designed for voice, not data, communications. To those reading the reports, it became patently clear the CCB had neither the resources, or expertise, to make sense of the fifty-five responses, so Stanford Research Institute, International (SRI), a think tank and consulting firm on the West Coast, was contracted to do the analysis. Unmistakably, however, changes in market conditions and technologies were challenging the status quo – any broad policy implications, however, would have to wait for the SRI report, not expected until March 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, those users brave enough to try timesharing found themselves caught in a no man’s land between the time-sharing firms and the telephone companies. One such story was told in the May 1968 issue of Datamation,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc458&quot; href=&quot;#fn458&quot;&gt;458&lt;/a&gt; a leading trade magazine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;h3 id=&quot;some-problems-with-time-sharing-by-bryan-wilkinson&quot;&gt;SOME PROBLEMS WITH TIME-SHARING by BRYAN WILKINSON&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Late in 1966 our bank decided to experiment with commercial time-sharing, looking toward the day when our 360 branch banks would be linked to a central computer. I was given the responsibility for this experiment. There are two major telephone companies operating in the Los Angeles area and at least five companies selling commercial time-sharing service. We contracted with one of the larger, more experienced time-sharing vendors. Only one of the two telephone companies was involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our system was installed in February 1967……..The next day the potential users in our company and I were given a four-hour briefing on a simplified programming language and the system operation. We were handed three manuals (none of them indexed), and we were ‘experts.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The terminal, besides being an inexpensive, sturdy machine, allows one to enter programs or data by paper tape. It was our intention to have these tapes prepared by the secretaries so we asked who should train them. The time-sharing people indicated the telephone company, and they agreed. Fortunately, I decided to sit in on this session because the telephone company’s training representative started to teach our secretaries how to use the terminal as a teletypewriter, not as a time-sharing device. (The differences are considerable and confusing.) When I asked the instructor to cover only the relevant items, she was at a loss. She knew nothing about time-sharing. It developed that each time-sharing company makes special use of some of the characters so that only they could give adequate training about those things. Here, on our initial day of operations, we ran into the first of many vendor coordination problems. The time-sharing people could train on how to use their system; the phone company could train on how to use the terminal; but no one could give complete training. Until this could be resolved (and five months later it hadn’t been) the idea of using secretaries had to be shelved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether emboldened by the unaccustomed favorable press, or now sensing a sea change about them and it was time to lead, the FCC Commissioners on June 27, 1968, in a surprising and unanimous decision, despite last minute lobbying by AT&amp;amp;T and GTE that the integrity of the telephone system necessitated the use of only carrier-supplied attachments,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc459&quot; href=&quot;#fn459&quot;&gt;459&lt;/a&gt; ruled in the Carterfone case that the tariff restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;are, and have since their inception been, unreasonable, unlawful, and unreasonably discriminatory under the Communications Act of 1934.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc460&quot; href=&quot;#fn460&quot;&gt;460&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAM. (See Exhibit 2.18 - The Carterfone Decision ) The Commission went on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;…The vice of the present tariff…is that it prohibits the use of harmless, as well as harmful devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In view of the unlawfulness of the tariff, there would be no point in declaring it invalid as applied to the Carterfone and permitting it to continue in operation as to other interconnection devices. This would also put a clearly improper burden upon the manufacturers and users of other devices. The appropriate remedy is to strike the tariff and permit the carriers, if they so desire, to propose new tariff provisions in accordance with this opinion…….The carriers may submit new tariffs which will protect the telephone system against harmful devices, and they may specify technical standards if they wish.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc461&quot; href=&quot;#fn461&quot;&gt;461&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc462&quot; href=&quot;#fn462&quot;&gt;462&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T responded to the FCC’s Carterfone decision:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc463&quot; href=&quot;#fn463&quot;&gt;463&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have had the whole subject of connection of customer-owned devices in our network under intensive review for some time. Our intent is to be as responsive as possible to evolving communication needs through making our network available to expanding uses. At the same time, safeguards are essential to assure that other users of the network are not adversely affected.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc464&quot; href=&quot;#fn464&quot;&gt;464&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-218---the-carterfone-decision&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.18 - The Carterfone Decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-18-the-carterfone-decision.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.18 The Carterfone Decision&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formally, AT&amp;amp;T and GT&amp;amp;E responded by seeking FCC reconsideration. On July 29, 1968, the FCC stayed their decision awaiting the disposition of the petitions for reconsideration from AT&amp;amp;T and GT&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August Datamationreported the FCC decision as:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc465&quot; href=&quot;#fn465&quot;&gt;465&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FCC CARTERFONE DECISION UNSETTLES CARRIERS, ENCOURAGES MODEM MAKERS. - Datamation August 1968&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FCC dropped one shoe June 26 when it decided that Ma Bell’s foreign attachment restrictions are unnecessary, and unfair to users; last month, computer users and foreign attachment manufacturers were waiting for the other shoe to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experts familiar with the arcane world of communications utility regulation agreed that the next move was up to the carriers. As one lawyer put it: ‘the commission has blasted a gaping hole in the tariff wall, leaving the carriers dangerously exposed. At this moment, any user could hang any foreign attachment on his telephone line and not worry too much about getting arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added, however, that the user would be hurting himself as well as the telephone company. ‘The carriers lost largely because they couldn’t prove that foreign attachments were harmful. Almost certainly, they will now be looking doubly hard for such evidence in the hope of persuading a judge to overturn the commission’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then later in the same article:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ruling, if it stands, breaks the market for modems wide open, and provides a major opportunity for independent manufacturers in areas like touch-tone keyboards and picture-phone type units. There are no authoritative figures on the number of Western Electric’s modems in the dial-up network, but one manufacturer says that’s where 90% of the business is. Among data set suppliers are General Electric, which announced an extensive line late last year, Automatic Electric, Milgo, Rixon, Collins Radio, and Ultronic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, AT&amp;amp;T Board Chairman H. I. Romnes and President Ben Gilmer held a press conference, proposing a “new ‘data access arrangement,’ under which independently manufactured terminals could be coupled electrically, inductively, or acoustically to the public telephone system through a ‘protective device’ and a ‘network controller.’ The data communications user would pay $10 to have the protective device installed, and $2 a month for the service……Both devices are to be supplied exclusively by the Bell system, and no one else apparently will have any say in their design.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc466&quot; href=&quot;#fn466&quot;&gt;466&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the FCC asserted its decision: devices that did not adversely affect the telephone company’s operations, or the telephone system’s utility for others, could be connected to the interstate telephone system.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc467&quot; href=&quot;#fn467&quot;&gt;467&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article published that Fall, Strassburg wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An important principle for the computer user is involved in this case. The telephone system is the essential means by which users remote from the computers can have direct access to that computer. In order to create compatibility between the computer and the telephone circuit, it is necessary to use a ‘modem’ or modulator/demodulator. The telephone company requires that its own modem - the dataphone - be leased for this purpose. Computer manufacturers and users would like to furnish their own modems for many reasons which we need not detail. The telephone company permits extensive connection of computer and computer related devices to its telephone system, but the user must interface to the system with a dataphone - the device manufactured by Western Electric and available from the operating companies of the Bell System on a rental basis. A decision by the Commission to relax the restrictions on the customer’s use of foreign attachments would expand the opportunity for wider participation in not only the computer equipment market, but in the communications equipment market generally.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc468&quot; href=&quot;#fn468&quot;&gt;468&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, AT&amp;amp;T filed new tariffs that far exceeded the expectations of the FCC. Customers will be allowed to directly connect terminal equipment&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc469&quot; href=&quot;#fn469&quot;&gt;469&lt;/a&gt; to the public switchednetwork provided they connect using an AT&amp;amp;T supplied protective connecting arrangement (PCA). (See Exhibit 2.19 - AT&amp;amp;T Carterfone Tariff.) As Strassburg later testified: “AT&amp;amp;T went well beyond the requirements of Carterfone.” The FCC ruled before the year-end holidays that the new tariffs would become effective January 1, 1969.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc470&quot; href=&quot;#fn470&quot;&gt;470&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-219---att-carterfone-tariff&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.19 - AT&amp;amp;T Carterfone Tariff&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-19-att-carterfone-tarrif.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.19 AT&amp;amp;T Carterfone Tariff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the new tariffs became effective, AT&amp;amp;T announced that the PCA for modems would be called a Data Access Arrangement, or DAA. DAA’s had two primary functions: assure telephone network integrity by limiting the signal power of attached modems to a level that would not exceed the power-level of the network, and maintain exclusive Bell control of all network signaling functions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc471&quot; href=&quot;#fn471&quot;&gt;471&lt;/a&gt; To be installed only by Bell personnel for a modest fee, and to rent for $2 to $4 per month, DAA’s were a single circuit board that came with a separate telephone set having a voice/data key. All network connections had to be made manually and there were no provisions for either automatic dialing or unattended answering; even though Bell modems had these functions. So while the DAA’s made it possible to connect independent manufacturers modems to the switched telephone network for the first time, they severely constrained modem functionality and introduced costs not incurred using Bell modems – for Bell modems did not require DAA’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately there were protests. Why should modems of independent manufacturers be burden with extra costs and reduced functionality? Bell was up to its old tricks again, only now there were affected parties who were not going to let Bell get away with it. What seemed particularly preposterous to those independent modem manufacturers selling modems to telephone companies was that their modems would now have to be re-engineered to work with DAA’s. Where was the logic that made it possible for them to sell a modem to a telephone company, which could sell it to a customer, but the modem manufacturer could not sell the very same modem to that same customer? In response, AT&amp;amp;T claimed: If we provide it, we maintain it and we know it’s going to work right. If the customer provides it, he might not maintain it, and a short might cause a voltage surge on the line which might kill somebody.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc472&quot; href=&quot;#fn472&quot;&gt;472&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sympathetic as the CCB staff were finding themselves becoming, the new AT&amp;amp;T tariffs were already more liberal than anyone would have thought possible only months earlier, and too much was at risk to proceed willy-nilly. Strassburg remembers telling those complaining: “Well, you may be right, but this is where it is right now, and until we find a better alternative, this is where it’s going to stay, because we’re not going to open up the network to indiscriminate connections for fear that this would degrade the performance of the network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc473&quot; href=&quot;#fn473&quot;&gt;473&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing arm-in-arm with AT&amp;amp;T might have been past practice, but now the CCB wanted independent assessment of alternatives to PCAs, freeing them from their dependence on AT&amp;amp;T’s recommendations. Seeking the most impartial, technically competent organization, the FCC contracted with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study the tariffs and to recommend alternatives.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc474&quot; href=&quot;#fn474&quot;&gt;474&lt;/a&gt; A report was expected in about a year, with hearings scheduled for September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this same period, February 1969, the FCC received the SRI report&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc475&quot; href=&quot;#fn475&quot;&gt;475&lt;/a&gt; commissioned to analyze the responses to the Notice of Inquiry. The report was too technical and detailed to be understood by anyone at the FCC or CCB. So Strassburg, once again, sought out Baran, who had since left Rand and started the Institute for the Future (IFF) – Romnes, of AT&amp;amp;T, was a member of IFF’s Board of Trustees. Baran agreed to interpret the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after taking the assignment, AT&amp;amp;T offered Baran’s IFF a lucrative, and interesting, consulting contract. Needing the work, Baran notified the FCC of his potential conflict of interest and ceased being a consultant.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc476&quot; href=&quot;#fn476&quot;&gt;476&lt;/a&gt; The AT&amp;amp;T assignment was to study its management practices and to contribute as required. Baran remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it was very useful because they were able to get some inputs in how they are really perceived…..and that their real problem is going to come from the data communication entrepreneurs, because now, for the first time, they had a constituency who might perceived it worth their while going after AT&amp;amp;T. The old constituency in the past was never big enough, or had enough interest, to attend hearings or doing anything, but now you have these new entrepreneurs coming along and that you’re probably better off giving in to them and not threaten the rest of your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Baran’s help, in May, the FCC issued the Report and Further Notice of Inquiryto solicit opinions on the SRI study. Respondents’ comments added little to the FCC’s understanding.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc477&quot; href=&quot;#fn477&quot;&gt;477&lt;/a&gt; The CCB now had the task of deciding what actions they should, and would, take as a result of collecting the comments and materials through its Inquiry. The CCB, and thus the FCC also have to deal with all the other common carrier workload. (In August, the FCC will approve the license of MCI to operate a competitive common carrier service between St. Louis and Chicago.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc478&quot; href=&quot;#fn478&quot;&gt;478&lt;/a&gt; Often referred to as either the MCI, or SCC (Specialized Common Carrier), ruling.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc479&quot; href=&quot;#fn479&quot;&gt;479&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg remembers his perspective changing during this period:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We, I at least, felt there was a compelling reason to be concerned about certain trends that were out there, that Bell couldn’t be all things to all people for all times. That the environment had changed, or was changing, and that innovation and creativity didn’t all start within the walls of Bell Labs, and all the wisdom wasn’t necessarily in Bell Labs. We were also concerned – I was concerned that AT&amp;amp;T was beginning to grow big, in terms of not only revenue – they had always been dominant as a corporate power – but at this time it was getting awfully big, so was there room for other participants in this marketplace called communications?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 3, 1970, the FCC issued its Tentative Decision and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 28 F.C.C. 2d 291 (1970) or the “Tentative Decision.” The entire proceedings become popularly known as the “Computer Inquiry.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc480&quot; href=&quot;#fn480&quot;&gt;480&lt;/a&gt; Public argument of the Tentative Decision was scheduled for September 3, 1970, and March 18, 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tentative Decision addressed four key issues: Data Processing Computer Services, Common-Carrier Provision of Data Processing, Store-and-Forward Message-Switching Services and Hybrid Services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc481&quot; href=&quot;#fn481&quot;&gt;481&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Processing Computer Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All agreed that data processing did not exhibit economies of scale as did natural monopolies such as telephone exchange services. Therefore, the FCC concluded: “…in view of all the foregoing evidence of an effective competitive situation, we see no need to assert regulatory authority over data processing facilities in order to link the terminals of subscribers to centralized computers.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc482&quot; href=&quot;#fn482&quot;&gt;482&lt;/a&gt; The Commission retained the prerogative to “re-examine the policies set forth herein…if there should develop significant changes in the structure of the data processing industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common-Carrier Provision of Data-Processing Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complicated issue and one that would remain unresolved until the Final Report. The problem came when common carriers wanted to engage in unregulated activity. How could economically motivated cross subsidies from regulated to unregulated businesses be avoided?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store-and-Forward Message-Switching Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC concluded message-switching services were “essentially communications” and “warrant appropriate regulatory treatment as common carrier services under the Act.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc483&quot; href=&quot;#fn483&quot;&gt;483&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid services were those having both data processing and message-switching components. The Commission, using a “primary business test,” said: “Where message switching is offered as an integral part of, and as an incidental feature of a package offering that is primarily data processing, there will be total regulatory forbearance with respect to the entire service whether offered by a common carrier or non-common carrier, except to the extent that common carriers offering such a hybrid service will do so through [separate] affiliates…..If, on the other hand, the package offering is oriented essentially to satisfy the communications or message switching requirements of the subscriber, and the data processing feature or function is an integral part of, and incidental to message switching, the entire service will be treated as a communications service for hire, whether offered by a common carrier or a non-common carrier and will be subject to regulation under the Communications Act.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc484&quot; href=&quot;#fn484&quot;&gt;484&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the FCC heard oral arguments on the Tentative Decision from some twenty interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, 1970, the FCC received the NAS report&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc485&quot; href=&quot;#fn485&quot;&gt;485&lt;/a&gt; commissioned in response to the uproar over the tariffs filed by AT&amp;amp;T requiring the use of DAA’s. (See Exhibit 2.21 - NAS Recommendation.) The report concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Uncontrolled interconnection could cause harm to personnel, network performance, and property.2) The use of protective couplers and signal-level criteria was an acceptable way of assuring network protection; however, the added equipment increased overall costs.3) A program of standards and enforced certification of equipment would be another acceptable way of assuring network protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subsequent study commissioned by the FCC to Dittberner Associates, a Washington-based firm of computer consultants, concluded that manufacturers of data modems and other types of interconnected customer equipment could easily build into their equipment the necessary circuitry to protect the telephone network – the common carriers need not be the only ones providing network protective couplers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc486&quot; href=&quot;#fn486&quot;&gt;486&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, a program of standards and certification would be an inexpensive way to extend interconnection privileges without harm to the common-carrier network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the NAS and Dittberner reports agreed, safe attachment of customer provided equipment could be accomplished without the objectionable carrier-supplied access arrangements or PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc487&quot; href=&quot;#fn487&quot;&gt;487&lt;/a&gt; Knowing an alternative to the PCAs existed, and given no cessation of complaints – long delays in getting PCA’s installed, too expensive, and constantly changing interface specifications – the CCB needed a plan of action. Due to manufacturer and customer interest, PBX standards and certification procedures were selected to be first. On March 26, 1971, the FCC established a PBX industry advisory committee with some thirty members representing carriers, equipment manufacturers, and users. This committee had the responsibility to devise technical standards, as well as certification and enforcement procedures permitting direct connection of PBX equipment to the telephone network – without using PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc488&quot; href=&quot;#fn488&quot;&gt;488&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same month, on March 18, 1971, the FCC, in a divided 4 to 3 vote, rendered its Final Decision in the Inquiry.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc489&quot; href=&quot;#fn489&quot;&gt;489&lt;/a&gt; (Final Decision, 28 FCC 2d 267 (1971)). In it, the FCC introduced the concept of”maximum separation”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc490&quot; href=&quot;#fn490&quot;&gt;490&lt;/a&gt; to solve the problem of common carriers wanting to provide data processing services. To compete in the unregulated field of data processing services, common carriers could only do so through separate subsidiaries with separate books of account, separate officers, separate operating personnel, separate equipment, and facilities devoted exclusively to the rendition of data processing services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc491&quot; href=&quot;#fn491&quot;&gt;491&lt;/a&gt; These subsidiaries would lease communication services from carriers (the parent company or any other carrier) under public tariffs, just like competing suppliers of data-processing services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc492&quot; href=&quot;#fn492&quot;&gt;492&lt;/a&gt; Issues remained, however, particularly those of “hybrid services.” But in general, the regulatory issues between data processing and communications seemed settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-220---nas-recommendation&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.20 - NAS Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-b-2-20-nas-recommendation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.20 NAS Recommendation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is customary with FCC determinations, the common carriers filed petitions for judicial review of the Final Decision. Arguments before the court will be held in the Fall, and the Second Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals will issue its decision – “essentially” upholding the commission’s determinations – on February 1, 1973.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc493&quot; href=&quot;#fn493&quot;&gt;493&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as the FCC wanted to proceed in an orderly fashion, events soon took a life of their own. The cause – two proposed tariffs filed by AT&amp;amp;T in late 1971. The first mandated use of DAA’s on leased lines that had to-date been exempt from the PCA tariffs. Interestingly, leased lines were also the facilities experiencing the most competition from the independent modem manufacturers; a connection not lost on the modem manufacturers. The second tariff lowered modem rental rates.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc494&quot; href=&quot;#fn494&quot;&gt;494&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Slomin, lawyer at the FCC working closely with Strassburg on the issues being discussed, remembers the just then forming cooperative of independent modem and other data communication manufacturers, the Independent Data Communications Manufacturers Association (IDCMA) crying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is manifestly anti-competitive. This is evidence of a grand master plan to wipe us out, and furthermore, its predicated on a false premise anyway. This data access arrangement is ridiculous. It’s not needed. Our devices are designed properly to work with the telephone network, indeed, our companies sell them to about a hundred governments abroad for use with their telephone networks and there’s no problem whatsoever. And finally, the data access arrangement is a Cadillac when a Chevy would have done the job. It has extra functions and, on top of all else, it impairs our communications. It introduces its own aberrations and makes our communications service stinky. Do something about this, FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive outrage could no longer be contained within the deliberative proceedings of the FCC – antitrust lawsuits soon began clogging the courts. And as justice seemed too slow or uncertain, the battleground moved to Congress with its power to change the laws. These consequences flowed directly from the FCC changing the rules of competition – especially those of foreign attachments and SSCs.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;All this while the jurisdictional struggles between the Federal Government – as the FCC, Justice Department, and Congress – and the states brew. (The issues once again being interstate versus intrastate commerce.) The FCC had regulatory authority over interstate telecommunications. And each state had a PUC regulating intrastate telecommunications. The Carterfone and SCC decisions precipitated conflict among these jurisdictional authorities for if customers provided their own CPE, or connected to common carriers other than the telephone companies, revenues would be lost to the telephone companies, with the logical conclusion local telephone rates would either have to go up or, minimally, would not be as low as they could be. Known as the separations problem,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc496&quot; href=&quot;#fn496&quot;&gt;496&lt;/a&gt; and a necessary consequence of enforcing a natural monopoly, that is each user had one telephone which could be connected to all other telephones: How were the revenues and costs of an interstate telephone call to be allocated among the intrastate and interstate carriers. The practice had been to allocate some of the revenue of an interstate call to both intrastate telephone companies, and to allocate some of the telephone and intrastate network costs to the interstate carrier. Hence, the states benefited from both more revenue and lower costs from interstate calls – a major reason local rates were declining. Hence, state PUC opposition could be expected to the recent FCC rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg knew this jurisdictional struggle with the states had to be preempted. So he organized a Joint Proceeding with NARUC (National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners – an outgrowth of NARUC with R as Railroad.). Announced on June 14, 1972, Docket 19419 carried the long title of the Interstate and Foreign MTS and WATS, 35 F.C.C.2d 539 (1972). It did not specifically rule for intrastate, but as a Joint Proceeding, with representation from both FCC and PUCs (Three from the FCC, four from the PUC’s.), it was meant to define rules that would be adopted by all, so jurisdictional disputes would not increase telecommunication costs, or prevent use of the telephone in ways wanted by consumers – privately beneficial, and not publicly detrimental. Strassburg made clear that the object of the Proceeding was not to review Carterfone, that had been decided – tariffs now allowed connection of customer-provided CPE with the use of PCAs.. The issue was whether, and under what conditions, customers would be permitted to provide their own PCAs to perform network control signaling and connecting arrangements. Strassburg recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We directed that the Joint Board would consider the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences, the Advisory Committees, the Chief Engineers Office, and any other comments. That was to be the forum for formally resolving the PCA issues and registration – or any other alternatives to PCAs.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc497&quot; href=&quot;#fn497&quot;&gt;497&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NARUC and the individual states were not content to leave all to the Joint Proceeding however. NARUC and seventeen state PUCs conducted their own investigations of the harms that could result from the interconnection of customer-owned and maintained terminal equipment – CPE. To get data required requesting it from AT&amp;amp;T, which wanted to support NARUC’s concerns and, ideally, reverse the Carterfone decision. In April 1973, they publicized their results. After studying 1,523 cases of CPE problems, they concluded: it is clear that the interconnection of subscriber-provided equipment has had adverse effects to date on the quality of telephone service.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc498&quot; href=&quot;#fn498&quot;&gt;498&lt;/a&gt; NARUC deferred in drawing conclusions however. Five weeks later, the FCC reported that in reviewing the data: statistically meaningful differences between customer-provided and telephone-company provided equipment could not be demonstrated.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc499&quot; href=&quot;#fn499&quot;&gt;499&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina then acted to challenge the authority of the FCC to proscribe intrastate telecommunications policies and tariffs. The North Carolina PUC would not permit interstate connections to their intrastate telephone system. The interconnection they denied was to Telerent Leasing, which took the case to the FCC, demanding that they be permitted to connect to intrastate North Carolina. North Carolina was directly challenging the authority of the FCC to regulate intrastate commerce. They were not alone. The state PUC of Nebraska declared any PBX connected to intrastate lines a common carrier, needing to get a certificate of convenience and necessity; which, if not obvious, will take a long time. Where North Carolina took battle to the courts, Nebraska waged war administratively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through out this period, AT&amp;amp;T had to implement their PCA program, and, increasingly, defend their policy from charges of monopoly and conspiracy to monopolize. By 1974, there would be nearly one hundred different kinds of PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc500&quot; href=&quot;#fn500&quot;&gt;500&lt;/a&gt; As for DAA’s, the PCAs used with modems, as of January 1972, over 10,000 were in use - half manual and half automated, the later introduced in mid-1970.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc501&quot; href=&quot;#fn501&quot;&gt;501&lt;/a&gt; (By July 1978, 1, 160,000 PCAs would be in use.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc502&quot; href=&quot;#fn502&quot;&gt;502&lt;/a&gt; ) Alternatives were emerging to the PCA; although by now years had passed since the PCA first had to be proscribed, used, and made widely-available. Those contesting AT&amp;amp;T claimed that alternatives were cheaper and better, and thus proved again AT&amp;amp;T’s conspiracy to monopolize. (Two examples were the STC voice connecting arrangement, developed by AT&amp;amp;T – ironically enough – and the Rochester program.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc503&quot; href=&quot;#fn503&quot;&gt;503&lt;/a&gt; ) There were also the claims that AT&amp;amp;T should have implemented a registration program, like the one being discussed by the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 1974, Walter R. Hinchman became the new Chief of CCB on Stassburg’s retirement. In March 1974, only months after retiring, Strassburg gave a speech to a meeting of the North American Telephone Association (NATA); independent manufacturers of CPE organized by Tom Carter of Carterfone. Strassburg advised them that they must look elsewhere than to regulation for a solution.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc504&quot; href=&quot;#fn504&quot;&gt;504&lt;/a&gt; Given the knowledge and insight of someone so respected, it is small wonder private antitrust suits began being filed in record numbers. (See Exhibit 2.21 Number of Active Antitrust Cases Pending Against AT&amp;amp;T.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1974, the FCC acted to protect Federal jurisdiction by issuing a declaratory ruling in the Telerent Leasing Proceeding asserting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;…primacy in authority over the terms and conditions governing the interconnection of customer-provided equipment to the nationwide telephone network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc505&quot; href=&quot;#fn505&quot;&gt;505&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;State PUCs could take no actions reversing or inconsistent with prior Federal rulings related to the interconnection of customer-owned CPE and systems to the indivisible telephone network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc506&quot; href=&quot;#fn506&quot;&gt;506&lt;/a&gt; The North Carolina PUC immediately appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit– North Carolina Utilities Commn v. FCC, 537 F.2d 787 (4th Cir.). NARUC and other states joined in the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the court took its time to render a decision in the jurisdictional dispute, the Joint Proceeding took testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 1974, two additional tariff disputes were brought to the FCC : Phonemate and Mebane Telephone Company. The Phonemate Corporation wanted to sell a telephone answering machine powered by four batteries. AT&amp;amp;T said it had to use a PCA. The FCC litigated assuming that four batteries could not cause harm. Only the product had been designed wrong, and, in fact, could under the right circumstances cause harm. Only by the time this became known, AT&amp;amp;T had come to recognize their position to be absurd, and Phonemate did not want their incompetence made known, so they agreed that AT&amp;amp;T would supply some protective circuitry that Phonemate would put in every machine. While seemingly innocuous, it would be seen as an example manufacturers were capable of providing their own protective circuitry, i.e. PCAs, so their products could connect directly to the telephone network. The Mebane case was slightly different. The small, independent Mebane Telephone Company of North Carolina took the position that the FCC did not have the authority to mandate they tariff customer-provided equipment. No tariff, no interconnection. In May 1975, the FCC made a conscious extension&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc507&quot; href=&quot;#fn507&quot;&gt;507&lt;/a&gt; of the Carterfone policy to reject Mebane’s tariff position – Mebane had to tariff customer-provided CPE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1975, the FCC issued its first decision from the Joint Proceedings. Direct connection of customer-provided CPE would be allowed, subject to either FCC registration or self-certification. If such CPE met rigorous technical criteria – the Commissions registration program comprised 112 pages of procedures and technical specifications&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc508&quot; href=&quot;#fn508&quot;&gt;508&lt;/a&gt; – no PCA had to be used. PCA’s remained required for CPE not registered. The parties that had appealed the Telerent Leasing decision now appealed the FCC’s registration program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1976, the Fourth Circuit Court ruled in the Telerent Leasing case, two to one, in support of the FCC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc509&quot; href=&quot;#fn509&quot;&gt;509&lt;/a&gt; The FCC could preempt state jurisdiction to impose nationwide telephone standards. Before the end of the year, an appeal to the Supreme Court was refused for review without further comment. The FCC’s authority had been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1977, the Fourth Circuit Court ruled that the FCC’s equipment registration/certification was legal. Six months later the Supreme Court again denied a writ of certiorari – request for review. The power of the FCC had been asserted again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late March, in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Paul Henson, Chairman of the Board of United Telecommunications proposed the Primary Instrument Concept – all basic single line telephone service included one telephone owned and maintained by the telephone company. It was justified on many grounds, e.g. it maintained telephone company end-to-end responsibility, it helped keep local rates down, safety issues, and transitional advantages. On October 3, 1977, the Chairman and Ranking Majority member requested the FCC consider implementing the Primary Instrument Concept. The FCC started an inquiry on February 6, 1978, and on August 2, issued a report declining to adopt the recommended Concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers had the right to connect equipment of their choice to Bell’s network.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When John D. deButts became Chairman and CEO of AT&amp;amp;T on April 1, 1972, he, like Vail in 1907, inherited a dispirited organization in need of direction and leadership. The Carterfone and SCC decisions represented virulences infecting the soul of what made AT&amp;amp;T special. And deButts knew so to his very being, for his career had been charted through the operating companies, where competition was abhorrent to the principled calling of pubic service, not an experiment that could be intellectualized away as only someone with Bell Labs and Western Union experience like Romnes could do. Ending any and all tolerance to the changes afoot became a priority for deButts. He wanted to return AT&amp;amp;T to the glory days of Vail where One System, One Policy, Universal Service breathed life into work. Only what deButts did not, and maybe could not, reckon were the times called for a new spirit and practice of public service, one that would prove elusive to the increasingly combative deButts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc510&quot; href=&quot;#fn510&quot;&gt;510&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1973, deButts delivered a telling speech entitled An Unusual Obligation to a meeting of the members of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). In words no one could misunderstand, he rejected competition and committed to fight to the end: to take to the public the case for the common carrier principle and thereby implication to oppose competition, espouse monopoly.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc511&quot; href=&quot;#fn511&quot;&gt;511&lt;/a&gt; He knew his speech might, even would, inflame those in government hell bent on change. He could care less. He had all the fight anyone would care to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and deButts got what it wanted when in March 1974, MCI filed an antitrust lawsuit charging twenty-two counts of unlawful activity. MCI had plenty of company, for by 1980, sixty private antitrust lawsuits would be filed against AT&amp;amp;T. Clearly corporations that wanted to compete in telecommunications had had it with the glacial workings of the FCC. Three charges were most common: AT&amp;amp;T’s persistent refusal to allow foreign attachment and required use of PCA’s, refusal to allow interconnection of interexchange competitors, and monopolized purchasing with WE.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc512&quot; href=&quot;#fn512&quot;&gt;512&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress also made itself known. In 1974, Senator Phillip A. Hart, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee, held hearings on his Industrial Reorganization Act which would restructure seven U. S. industries, including telecommunications, to make them more competitive. Appearing before this Subcommittee, Clay T. Whitehead, Director of the Office of Telecommunications Policy,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc513&quot; href=&quot;#fn513&quot;&gt;513&lt;/a&gt; testified: [t]he antitrust laws should be enforced to ensure that regulatory mechanisms cannot become a haven for escape from competition…..Finally, a restructuring of the communications industry may be necessary if competition and monopoly are to coexist constructively.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc514&quot; href=&quot;#fn514&quot;&gt;514&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Business once again fell under public scrutiny. Only this time, Government bore the stigma of big was bad as well. Failures such as the Vietnam War, President Richard M. Nixon’s impeachment (Watergate), and inescapable inflation – even Wage and Price Controls proved ineffective – all contributed to a social climate suspicious if large organizations and institutions could solve much of anything. Within the Federal Government this had the effect of weakening the authority of political appointments and strengthening the power of permanent staff. In the case of the Justice Department, staff that had harbored resentment towards the 1956 Consent Decree increasingly saw an opportunity to seize the initiative and win in the courts what had been lost in private negotiations by political operatives. The fact that the Justice Department was considering such action had leaked as early as December 1973, when Business Week reported that AT&amp;amp;T had been subpoenaed for documents, and that [m]any in the communications industry are certain that it is a precursor to further action – either an antitrust suit or reopening a 1956 consent decree.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc515&quot; href=&quot;#fn515&quot;&gt;515&lt;/a&gt; President Ford further encouraged such action when on October 20 he gave a speech calling for tougher antitrust enforcement.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc516&quot; href=&quot;#fn516&quot;&gt;516&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 20, 1974, the Justice Department began its fourth major assault on AT&amp;amp;T when it filed the antitrust lawsuit: United States v. AT&amp;amp;T Co.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc517&quot; href=&quot;#fn517&quot;&gt;517&lt;/a&gt; More extensive than the 1949 suit, the broad complaint charged AT&amp;amp;T had monopolized and conspired to monopolize various telecommunication markets: including customer-provided equipment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc518&quot; href=&quot;#fn518&quot;&gt;518&lt;/a&gt; The relief sought was for AT&amp;amp;T to divest itself of WE, for WE to be divided into multiple companies, and for some or all of the Bell Operating Companies to be split from AT&amp;amp;T Long Lines. The question of Bell Labs was deferred.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc519&quot; href=&quot;#fn519&quot;&gt;519&lt;/a&gt; The immediate reactions from the financial community were mostly negative; the Wall Street Journal wrote: Where is the problem that justifies risking possible damage to the efficiency of a vital part of the U. S. infrastructure.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc520&quot; href=&quot;#fn520&quot;&gt;520&lt;/a&gt; President deButts wrote shareholders that AT&amp;amp;T was not in violation of the law, the lawsuit was hostile to the public interest, and AT&amp;amp;T would fight it to the end. A Justice Department spokesperson responded: I don’t believe we can promise that winning this suit is going to lower rates – but implying the law must be enforced.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc521&quot; href=&quot;#fn521&quot;&gt;521&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the case was being assigned to Judge Joseph C. Waddy, District of Columbia Federal District Court, AT&amp;amp;T prepared its response. The decided strategy had three elements: fight the legality of the suit, employ delaying tactics, and seek redress in Congress.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc522&quot; href=&quot;#fn522&quot;&gt;522&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s formal response detailed the history of regulation, dating back to the Kingsbury Commitment. It then argued that the suit was illegal under res judicata – the 1956 Consent Decree precluded a suit of divestiture, for the Justice Department in that Consent Decree had approved AT&amp;amp;T’s structure. Fundamentally, the court lacked jurisdiction because the same issues were before the FCC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc523&quot; href=&quot;#fn523&quot;&gt;523&lt;/a&gt; Rejecting the first argument, Judge Waddy then requested comment from the FCC on the issue of jurisdiction. Over a year later, on the last day of 1975, the FCC filed its brief: the Communications Act does not explicitly authorize the Commission to alter AT&amp;amp;T’s corporate structure.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc524&quot; href=&quot;#fn524&quot;&gt;524&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, there was no general reason why antitrust policy should be deemed inapplicable as a matter of law. The FCC had passed primary jurisdiction to the Justice Department – exactly the opposite of the Carterfone case. Judge Waddy concurred with an opinion of his own on November 24, 1976 – AT&amp;amp;T was subject to antitrust, not immunized by regulation. However, the Judge also made it known to AT&amp;amp;T counsel that he thought their claims weak. AT&amp;amp;T appealed the case, seeking better ruling, and delaying action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year earlier, in November 1975, when deButts learned that preparations were complete to seek legislation to obviate the uncertain course of the courts, he responded that it: may be the most important public affairs effort we have ever undertaken.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc525&quot; href=&quot;#fn525&quot;&gt;525&lt;/a&gt; Introduced in both houses of Congress as a bill amending the Communications Act of 1934, it carried the formal title of the Consumer Communications Reform Act (CCRA).Known otherwise as the Bell bill.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc526&quot; href=&quot;#fn526&quot;&gt;526&lt;/a&gt; It aimed to return telecommunications and AT&amp;amp;T to the nostalgic state existing before the Carterfone case et al. Heavy-handed and showing no room for compromise, it nevertheless received respectable support. Only in the mistakes of introduction, it alienated powerful enemies, like the head of the House Subcommittee on Communications, Lionel Van Deerlin. Van Deerlin announced hearings on competition in telecommunications, effectively derailing the CCRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC was not to be left behind, outdistanced by the Justice Department. They had changed the institutional rules and they wanted to have their say in their enforcement, even if it meant structural questions. To increase its authority it needed to assert its rights, to clarify questions of regulatory authority left open in Computer Inquiry I. By late 1975, it had become clear that computers and communications were converging, and faster than anyone had thought. In 1969, ten percent of computers could communicate over the telephone network – as data communications. In 1976, forty-five percent could – and there were nine times as many computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc527&quot; href=&quot;#fn527&quot;&gt;527&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, AT&amp;amp;T had just announced a new interactive computer terminal, the Dataspeed 40/4 – Should the FCC tariff it? Hybrid services, and other open questions, needed better rules defining what was subject to regulations, and what was not. So a Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemaking was initiated on July 29, 1976, and formally released on August 9. It is Computer Inquiry II. It will take three years, until 1979, before the FCC is ready to propose its Tentative Decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1977, the Supreme Court declined to review Judge Waddy’s decision asserting jurisdictional authority, thus ending AT&amp;amp;T’s appeals process. The Judge then order AT&amp;amp;T and the DOJ to begin the discovery process – the collection from the other of documents and material needed to prove their respective cases. In February 1978, he ruled that they could not share discovery efforts with those having filed private antitrust suits – a ruling benefiting AT&amp;amp;T. It would be Judge Waddy’s last significant ruling, for by the summer of 1978, poor health forced reassignment of all his cases. The AT&amp;amp;T case became the responsibility of a newly appointed District Judge, Harold H. Greene. Judge Greene was an active Judge, in contrast to Judge Waddy, and in September he issued orders with a trial date of September 1980. With time it would slip to January 15, 1981; still light speed compared to the pace under Judge Waddy. He also reversed Waddy’s rule that information could not be shared with those having filed private antitrust suits, a decision AT&amp;amp;T would appeal – in June 1979 the Supreme Court denied review, thus sustaining Greene’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1979, Charles L. Brown succeeded deButts as Chairman and CEO of AT&amp;amp;T. He had seen enough of combativeness and knew it was time to accept the new terms of engagement. One of his first acts was to announce a management philosophy acknowledging and accepting competition – A New Realism: I am a competitor – and I look forward with anticipation and confidence to the excitement of the marketplace.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc528&quot; href=&quot;#fn528&quot;&gt;528&lt;/a&gt; Part of his confidence came from having led a reorganization of AT&amp;amp;T in 1978, one that redid the reorganization of 1973 – the first since 1909. The Vail organization had centered around functions, the deButts organization around services, and the new Brown organization would around customer groups.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc529&quot; href=&quot;#fn529&quot;&gt;529&lt;/a&gt; In segmenting its structure to focus on the differing needs of customer groups, such as businesses and consumers, AT&amp;amp;T abandoned the public utility notion that all customers are to be treated as equals. The reorganization also reflected the tremendous stresses acting on AT&amp;amp;T’s internal organization as a consequence of the uncertainties of its mission and competitive environment(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operationalizing A New Realism, Brown quickly tried to reach accommodation with the FCC, Congress, and those having filed private antitrust lawsuits. He met with little success. At the FCC, he sought advise on how to structure acceptable tariffs, only to be told that he did not understand how the process worked. AT&amp;amp;T proposed tariffs and the FCC either accepted or rejected them; it was not the role of the FCC tell AT&amp;amp;T what to do. With Congress, Brown knew he had to tread lightly and that there was an inherent inconsistency in AT&amp;amp;T’s position: wanting to retain regulation of the network with exemption from antitrust, yet also wanting to be able to compete in unregulated markets. Brown learned that legislation was not going to be as AT&amp;amp;T hoped, and might not happen at all. As for private antitrust suits, he did make some progress, but not enough to change the fact that AT&amp;amp;T was under siege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the FCC released its tentative decision for Computer Inquiry II. A key objective had been to better define Hybrid Services; services with both computer and communication components. Computer Inquiry II distinguished between voice, basic nonvoice, and enhanced nonvoice services. Voice services were to be regulated; basic nonvoice services, unregulated; and dominant carriers could offer basic nonvoice services, but only through separate subsidiaries. The services of the separate subsidiaries were not to be regulated, even if a common carrier offered them. AT&amp;amp;T objected to separate subsidiaries, arguing the advantages of economic synergies would be lost. The Justice Department objected to the very concept of the FCC trying to expand its authority under the Communication Act to include structural issues – arguing the Act gave them no such authority. The FCC took these and other comments under advisement.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc530&quot; href=&quot;#fn530&quot;&gt;530&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislative action, on hold due to hearings meant in part to diffuse the strong-arm tactics of AT&amp;amp;T, warmed up in 1978, when Representatives Van Deerlin and Louis Frey, Democrat and Republican, floated some preliminary ideas.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc531&quot; href=&quot;#fn531&quot;&gt;531&lt;/a&gt; Still little happened. In 1979, the Senate had multiple bills in progress. The whole process horribly bogged down. In the summer, Senator Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Communications Subcommittee warned: It would be a shame if legislation is impossible to enact, and then adding neither he nor subcommittee members will suffer no personal tragedy if there is no legislation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc532&quot; href=&quot;#fn532&quot;&gt;532&lt;/a&gt; (Legislation would remain undecided until 1985, when effectively ended; playing at best a foil for FCC or court action.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1979, AT&amp;amp;T received encouraging news in the Litton Systems, Inc. v. AT&amp;amp;T antitrust lawsuit. Litton had sued AT&amp;amp;T in 1976 claiming predatory and anticompetitive conduct and conspiracy to maintain an unlawful monopoly in customer-premises equipment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc533&quot; href=&quot;#fn533&quot;&gt;533&lt;/a&gt; Litton argued that the PCA represented yet another example of AT&amp;amp;T s monopolistic practices. The court sought expert testimony from Magistrate, Ken Sinclair, Jr. who counseled: “This action should be dismissed on grounds of implied immunity from the antitrust laws.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc534&quot; href=&quot;#fn534&quot;&gt;534&lt;/a&gt; He went on to add:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The continued pursuit of this action constitutes a contemplated retroactive application of the antitrust laws to conduct previously gauged by regulatory standards which are predicated on concepts of public interest inconsistent with the pure competitive model enforced by the Sherman Act.This conflict, and the comprehensive regulation embodied by federal and state programs, require that the action be terminated.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc535&quot; href=&quot;#fn535&quot;&gt;535&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, a court hearing another private antitrust suit against AT&amp;amp;T, filed this time by Essential Communications, Inc., reached exactly the opposite conclusion – neither the Communications Act or state regulatory laws provide a basis for an implied exemption.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc536&quot; href=&quot;#fn536&quot;&gt;536&lt;/a&gt; The courts were as confused as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 2, 1980, the FCC issued its Final Decision for Computer Inquiry II. It had simplified its Tentative Decision by distinguishing between only two categories of service: basic transmission or enhanced. Enhanced services where those that included computer processing on the content, code, protocol and other aspects of the subscriber’s information.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc537&quot; href=&quot;#fn537&quot;&gt;537&lt;/a&gt; The common carriers AT&amp;amp;T and GTE could offer unregulated, enhanced services, but only through separate subsidiaries; GTE would appeal and receive exemption. The commission debated whether the telephone itself should be treated different than other CPE, but in the end decided against the distinction. All CPE, approximately $4 billion, had to be transferred to a new subsidiary by March 1, 1982.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc538&quot; href=&quot;#fn538&quot;&gt;538&lt;/a&gt; The FCC also asserted its authority as described in the Tentative Decision to interpret the 1956 Consent Decree, and advised AT&amp;amp;T that it would support it in its dispute with the Justice Department. Thirty-four participants in the Computer Inquiry II process filed notices of appeal with the courts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc539&quot; href=&quot;#fn539&quot;&gt;539&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply filing an appeal did not satisfy the Department of Justice. Believing the FCC did not have the authority to change the terms of the 1956 Consent Decree, the Department of Justice filed suit in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, the court that had originally ruled in the 1956 Consent Decree, wanting to prevent AT&amp;amp;T from competing in unregulated markets. Siding with the Department of Justice were all those corporations not wanting AT&amp;amp;T as a new competitor, while AT&amp;amp;T supported the FCC. Two different courts were now deliberating the legality of the FCC’s Final Decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were not the only courts caught up in the battle to redefine the playing field of communications. The number of private antitrust suits seemed would never end – peaking in 1981 at sixty.(See Exhibit 2.21 Number of Active Antitrust Cases Pending Against AT&amp;amp;T.) As the courts began rendering decisions, AT&amp;amp;T kept coming up the loser. The momentum of public opinion, at least as represented by court decisions, clearly favored competition. Such was not lost on AT&amp;amp;T and Brown, for in the annual report for 1979, published just before the FCC issued its Final Decision, Brown wrote: Our third concern is the need – in an era of rapidly developing competition – to free the Bell System from the constraints of the 1956 Consent Decree. No longer does it make sense to deny the Bell System the opportunity to compete in unregulated markets.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc540&quot; href=&quot;#fn540&quot;&gt;540&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-220-number-of-active-antitrust-cases-pending-against-att&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.20 Number of Active Antitrust Cases Pending Against AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1960&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1961&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1962&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1963&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1964&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1965&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1966&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1967&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1968&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1969&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1970&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1971&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1972&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;29&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1974&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;38&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1976&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1977&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1978&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;51&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1981&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;60&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1982&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;59&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Alan Stone, Wrong Number: The Breakup of AT&amp;amp;T (New York: Basic Books, Inc., 1989) 154.(Antitrust at a Glance (AT&amp;amp;T Report) (December 15, 1982), in AT&amp;amp;T Archives.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as AT&amp;amp;T read unmistakable signs, so did the Justice Department. In September 1980, Judge Greene, intent on starting the United States v. AT&amp;amp;T Co. trial on January 15, 1981 made it clear to the Justice Department that he did not think much of their case, and had had it with what he considered their delaying tactics. A flurry of activity followed, not because of what he had said, but because Ronald Reagan swept into the Presidency that Fall in a landslide victory – with a mandate. With a new President would come a new Administration, and new personnel in charge of antitrust. If the outgoing Carter Justice Department was going to have their way, an out-of-court settlement needed to be agreed to before they left office – coincidentally just before the scheduled trial date. Intensive negotiations ensued, and in December, the opposing parties approached Judge Greene, requesting a postponement of the trial to concentrate on reaching an agreement. Judge Greene encouraged their efforts, yet refused to lift the incentive of avoiding trial. A week later, they again asked Judge Greene to postpone the trial, claiming they were near agreement. This time, he gave some, not delaying opening statements, but deferring case presentations to February 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1981, William F. Baxter became the new Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust. A Stanford law professor, with strong ideals, and a considered view of economics and competition. On taking office his two superiors recused themselves from involvement in the AT&amp;amp;T case for conflict of interest reasons. Baxter thus became the chief Justice Department official on the case – reporting to the White House. The results, however, will be very different than the recusal of the Attorney General in 1886. Baxter decided to handle the case himself, to be free of what had happened before him, and the constraints implied. He saw the case as one of extending what the FCC had started – to separate from AT&amp;amp;T that which was meant to be regulated, from that better controlled by the forces of market competition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc541&quot; href=&quot;#fn541&quot;&gt;541&lt;/a&gt; On his first meeting with the chief negotiator of AT&amp;amp;T, Howard Trienans, the chief counsel to AT&amp;amp;T – who had come not from within AT&amp;amp;T, but an outside law firm, and thus somewhat similarly unencumbered by past practices to see a new solution. Baxter said past negotiations were ended, and that his position was that AT&amp;amp;T should divest the Operating Companies and go about its business competing with the Long Lines, Bell Labs, and WE. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 3, Judge Vincent Biunno of the New Jersey District Court ruled the FCC’s Final Decision that AT&amp;amp;T could compete in unregulated markets, but only as separate subsidiaries, was a legal modification of the 1956 Consent Decree. AT&amp;amp;T immediately filed an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December, AT&amp;amp;T, motivated to a decision by Congressional activity to pass communication legislation – legislation that might be much worse than Baxter’s offer – agreed and a jointly released press statement on December 31 announced talks that might lead to the settlement of pending litigation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc542&quot; href=&quot;#fn542&quot;&gt;542&lt;/a&gt; Baxter then went to work securing Administration support for the agreement; agreement not to be presumed. On January 8, the Justice Department and AT&amp;amp;T, Baxter and Brown, signed a decree ending the antitrust suit.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc543&quot; href=&quot;#fn543&quot;&gt;543&lt;/a&gt; Then in an intricate series of legal maneuvers, the case was to be moved from the New Jersey District Court to Judge Greene’s court and the settlement would revise the 1956 Consent Decree and settle the case.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc544&quot; href=&quot;#fn544&quot;&gt;544&lt;/a&gt; Or it was suppose to be moved, only Judge Biunno accepted the agreement instead of referring it to Judge Greene, which meant it could be appealed and thus not final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both Houses of Congress legislation began emerging seeking to change the terms of the agreement to better assure that local telephone rates remained low and the principle of universal service remained intact. Concerned elected officials still saw long distance telephone service as a monopoly, a monopoly needing to be regulated, in part, so that subsidies could continue to flow from interstate to intrastate revenues, and thus help sustain low local rates. The Justice Department, AT&amp;amp;T, and now an angry Judge Greene, who saw his authority abused by the New Jersey court, all wanted their agreement to be made fina,l and not complicated by legislative action. AT&amp;amp;T began a publicity campaign inciting public protest over legislation, which proved successful, and the three parties succeeded in having court authority transferred to Judge Greene’s court. Judge Greene then inserted ten modifications, all of which were accepted, and the settlement was finalized on August 24, 1982. One of the ten amendments to the agreement was that the Operating Companies could provide CPE, they just couldn’t become manufacturers. They would have to buy it from competitive firms, one of whom would be AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 1984, AT&amp;amp;T divested twenty-three Operating Companies which were aggregated into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs. The RBOCs remained regulated, while AT&amp;amp;T – Long Lines, Bell Labs, and WE – was unregulated, free to enter competitive markets, such as computers. (AT&amp;amp;T did begin to sell computers, even buying the existing competitor, National Cash Register. Then in 1995, what antitrust never succeeded in doing, market competition accomplished. AT&amp;amp;T spun-off both WE and Bell Labs; to be left as the Long Lines, and all the other business it had entered.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The institutional response to the convergence of computers and communications, first noticed in 1965, took nineteen years to complete Meanwhile, the dynamics of market competition in the computer market-structure had given rise to three generations of computers, with the IBM personal computer introduced in August 1981 soon to end the dominance of mainframe computers that began with the IBM 360 Series in 1964. As these institutional dynamics were working, communications technologies did not hibernate, but kept advancing, and by the time of the AT&amp;amp;T divestiture on January 1, 1984, one such technology, packet switching, was about to cause a technological discontinuity that will end the communication paradigm of circuit switching that had its roots in the first commercialization of Graham’s and Bell’s telephone. That story that will occupy the rest of this book.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;At the onset of World War II, the computer existed only as theory, a few large scale calculators and a number of disconnected research efforts. By the end of the war, a computer had been built, albeit too late to aid the war effort, and a community of organizations and individuals committed to advancing the state-of-the-art had been formed. Strangely, this all happened with minimal impact from those firms such as IBM, Remington Rand, Burroughs or NCR, whose products shared the same history of ideas as did computers and who would in the future be the first to dominate the commercialization of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas the designers of the early computers began with were neither new nor complete, and best found their expression in the products sold by firms of the office machinery market-structure. The two most influential bodies of ideas were those of calculating machines and computing engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the seventeenth century. Blaise Pascal created the first calculating machine and Gottfried Leibnitz developed the first logic of computing devices and then reduced them to practice. Their investigations led to the technologies embedded in a range of calculating machines such as adding machines, calculators, and cash registers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1833, Charles Babbage,motivated to calculate better astronomical tables, designed a steam-driven machine he claimed mechanized thought.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; He was to innovate the “difference engine” and the “analytical engine.” The latter used a form of punched cards to control difference procedures.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 1890, these ideas were reduced to a new, radical product – the tabulating machine – by Herman Hollerith. Hollerith had written his doctoral dissertation about tabulating machines. While working at the U. S. Census Office he designed and built the first tabulating machine which electrically read data in on punched cards.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; In 1896, Hollerith formed the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) to pursue commercial sales – the first one to the New York Central Railroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1911, Hollerith merged his company with four other measurement and information equipment manufacturers to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (C-T-R).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; In 1914, in the wake of a monopoly suit by the Justice Department, Thomas J. Watson left National Cash Register to become general manager of C-T-R. A year later he became president. C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accounting Machine Corporation (AMC) served as IBM’s principal rival. AMC, as well, owes its beginnings to the U. S. Government. In 1905, the Census Bureau contracted to buy needed tabulating machines from James Powers and his start-up AMC, instead of Hollerith. AMC’s technological edge, however, could not overcome IBM’s many other advantages, and in 1927, AMC sought a merger into Remington Rand with several other office machine companies. The two companies dominated the tabulating market – IBM with both electrical and mechanical machines, and Remington Rand with solely mechanical ones. In the 1930’s IBM gained an eight-to-one advantage&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; over Remington Rand largely by being the primary supplier of tabulating machines to the rapidly expanding U.S. Government under President Roosevelt and the New Deal Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recognized need for machines to perform scientific calculations prompted the civic-minded Watson and IBM to fund the development of the first computer in the world in 1939. The Mark I, designed by Professor Howard Aiken of Harvard University, was not electronic. Watson Jr. described it as “pretty much two tons of IBM tabulating machines synchronized on a single axis.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; IBM gave the Mark I to Harvard in 1944.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When World War II created the need for better “calculating” machines to make and break encryption codes as well as to calculate ballistic trajectories, the U. S. Government would draw on these ideas and efforts in building the world’s first computer. Even so, computational considerations remained on the periphery of strategic action. Then in 1949, the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb. The United States could no longer rely solely on mass production to ensure its security.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; Information, and with it the computer, became the source of competitive advantage and victory.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In late 1945 researchers at the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania powered up a machine that was 100 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet deep. It contained 17,000 vacuum tubes, about 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, and 6,000 switches. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC) was the first fully electronic computer. Designed and developed by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly under contractor supervision of Lieutenant Herman Goldstine,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; ENIAC funding came from the Army’s Ballistic Research Laboratory at Aberdeen. ENIAC had a serious defect. Although it could compute several hundred times faster than an electro-mechanical or relay-type machine&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; , the computer required rewiring with each new problem, consuming from 30 minutes to a full day.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; Nevertheless, in instantiating the first electronic computer, Eckert, Mauchly and Goldstine advanced the trajectory of computers beyond being just an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon completing the design of ENIAC, the team faced a new challenge: to design the next computer, one to be significantly better, preferably without the impossible constraint of rewiring. In the summer of 1944, Lieutenant Goldstine, by chance, encountered John von Neumann while waiting for a train. Goldstine began to tell von Neumann, the foremost applied mathematician of his time, about ENIAC. Von Neumann was himself involved in a number of secret projects needing more computation than then available, yet did not know of ENIAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 7, 1944, von Neumann visited the Moore School and began contributing ideas immediately. The collaboration between von Neumann, Eckert, Mauchly and Goldstine proved fruitful when they hit upon the concept of storing the logic instructions in memory – the “stored-program”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; computer. Instead of manual resetting of the switches, or worse yet, rewiring, to set-up the calculations of a new problem, the programmer could modify the program arithmetically.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; With these new architectural ideas, they designed the ENIAC’s successor, the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Calculator).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Thomas J. Watson Jr. had rejoined IBM after serving in the Air Force. In early 1946, Eckert and Mauchly gave Watson Jr. a tour of the Moore School and ENIAC. Although Watson Jr. sensed that Eckert and Mauchly thought they had a product with which to best IBM, he was unimpressed. “The truth was that I reacted to ENIAC the way some people probably reacted to the Wright brother’s airplane: it didn’t move me at all. I can’t imagine why I didn’t think, “Good God, that’s the future of the IBM company.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding the development of computer systems, such as the ENIAC and EDVAC, represented only one way the government advanced understanding of computer technologies. Government agencies also sponsored meetings and courses, with the objectives of theory development, diffusion of knowledge, and training of personnel needed to explore the computer trajectory. Diffusing the growing knowledge and practice of computers ensured the government a future base of personnel to design and build the computers the military would need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 1946, the Moore School held a six-week course entitled, “Theory and Techniques for the Design of Electronic Digital Computers,” sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Army Ordinance Department.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt; Six months later, the Navy sponsored a four-day conference at Harvard, 350 people attended.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; Representatives of government agencies, universities and a wide range of companies attended both of these significant events. Although many companies were learning about computers, none of them would be the first to act; that honor belongs to a start-up formed by Eckert and Mauchly in March 1946.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1946, the University of Pennsylvania dismissed Eckert and Mauchly because of their interests in commercializing the ENIAC and EDVAC. The two perceived an economic opportunity in selling computers and together formed the Electronic Control Company. The Census Bureau awarded them their first contract in June, beating out Raytheon. In 1947, the company changed its name to the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two additional contracts to build computers were signed – with A.C. Nielson and Prudential Life Insurance Company – with badly needed cash advances to fund continuing product investment. Henry Straus, a Delaware racetrack owner and vice president of American Totalizer, committed to invest half a million dollars for 40 percent of Eckert-Mauchly common stock. But Straus died in an airplane crash, and local financial institutions refused to honor the notes Straus had given the company. By 1949, the company verged on bankruptcy, despite having their three contracts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eckert and Mauchly contacted everyone they knew who might be interested in either funding them, or acquiring them: NCR, Remington Rand, IBM, Philco, Burroughs, Hughes Aircraft, and others. They signed their acquisition by Remington Rand in February 1950. Remington Rand then attempted to cancel the three contracts. Nielson and Prudential agreed reluctantly. But the Census Bureau refused to cancel. They were going to make Remington Rand deliver the agreed upon computer. This act, obviously, influenced the economic history of computers by forcing product instantiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Spring of 1951, the Eckert-Mauchly division of Remington Rand shipped the first UNIVAC I to the Census Bureau. The next five UNIVAC I’s shipped to the government as well, to the Atomic Energy Commission (2), Air Force, Army, and Navy.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another start-up, however, captured the honors of shipping the first commercial computer. The founders of Engineering Research Associates (ERA), after resigning from the Naval Communications Supplementary Activity, signed a contract with the Navy to develop the Atlas I computer. They had the right to resell the same technology commercially. The Atlas I computer as the ERA 1101 shipped in December 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1952, Remington Rand, repeating a pattern of organizational development used in the office machinery, acquired their second computer firm, ERA. This time Remington Rand owned the two leading firms, not firms wanting to be acquired because they had trouble competing. Remington Rand controlled the emerging computer market-structure, yet remained a distant second to IBM in office machinery, especially tabulating equipment. In 1954, Remington Rand sold their first UNIVAC to a commercial customer: General Electric.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1950, it was far from obvious that computers would become an economic force capable of restructuring the very nature of how business is conducted or how entire economies work. In fact, it was not even clear that there was a need for computers in business. Many assumed their role would be limited to scientific uses. Business Week February 1963 reported prevailing opinion in 1950 was eight or ten of the giant “electronic brains” would satisfy everyone’s needs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; Thomas J. Watson, President and CEO of IBM – the company that dominated the market for office machinery with approximately a 90% market share – should have known. Thomas J. Watson Jr. later writes: “My father initially thought the electronic computer would have no impact on the way IBM did business, because to him punch-card machines and giant computers belonged in totally separate realms.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the public demonstration of ENIAC in 1944, the press reported its “nimble electrons made possible visions of computers helping to break the sound barrier, predict the weather, unlock the secrets of genetics, and design weapons even more terrifying than the Atomic Bomb.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; On learning of ENIAC, the elder Watson called together his top engineers and told them that he wanted a better machine within eight months.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; He even conceded to use of vacuum tubes instead of the mechanical devices used in the Mark I. The result was the Selective Sequence Electronic Computer (SSEC), an electro-mechanical monster 120 feet long, with 12, 500 tubes and 21,400 mechanical relays. Not designed for commercial distribution, IBM dedicated it “to the use of science throughout the world.” It proved essential to the development of the atomic bombs used to end World War II. One housed prominently in IBM’s ground-floor, glass walled, Fifth Avenue, New York City offices could be used by all, without profit to IBM. Although it was the first calculator to run on software, IBM still suffered from a reputation “as a stodgy company that was wedded to punch cards and the past,” according to Watson Jr.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On learning in September 1947 that Eckert-Mauchly had signed a contract to sell a UNIVAC to Prudential, Watson raged, ordering his top engineers to design a computer better than UNIVACin a week. When they proposed a design incorporating magnetic tape storage, Watson’s unyielding commitment to punch cards thwarted action, ending for now any effort by IBM to sell computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1949, Watson Jr., recently promoted to executive vice president and frustrated by his father’s unwillingness to entertain any thought of responding to advances in electronics, and particularly computers, received help from an unsuspected quarter. Al Williams, a finance executive, reported on his study comparing research-and-development spending at RCA, General Electric, and other successful companies. On average, they spent three percent of revenue on R and D, while IBM only spent about two and a quarter percent. Reflexively, Watson commanded Watson Jr. to begin spending more money on research. In May of 1950, Watson Jr. promoted Wally McDowell to head an effort to build an electronics research operation with the order to hire “perhaps a few thousand”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; engineers and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But war, not management initiative, finally pushed IBM into the computer market. When the Korean War broke out, Watson “put the resources of IBM”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; at President Truman’s disposal. After studying the situation in Washington, James Birkenstock, manager of the Future Demands department, and scientist Cuthbert Hurd recommended to Watson Jr. that IBM build a “general-purpose scientific” computer. They felt they could find customers for thirty machines.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represented a break through in two regards: first, everyone besides Eckert-Mauchly were building one-of-a-kind machines; second, Birkenstock recommended that IBM fund the designs internally in order to own any potential patents.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; They estimated the design and prototype would cost three million dollars and the program three to four times that. The new computer – code named Defense Calculator, became the most expensive project in the company’s history, ten times the cost of SSEC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 1951, while work progressed on the Defense Calculator, management feared a lawsuit by the Truman Administration’s “anti-big business” Justice Department – they did constitute approximately 90% of the highly visible punch card business. Their concerns were justified. On January 21, 1952, the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against IBM claiming it constituted a monopoly. To Watson, whose prior experience at NCR with the Justice Department still left him bitter, there was absolutely no question but IBM would fight the unjustified claims. To his way of thinking, IBM represented only a very small percentage of all “numerical calculations done in business,” which seemed proof enough IBM did not constitute a monopoly. (This would not be the last monopoly suit the Justice Department would file against IBM.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 1952, IBM had a working prototype of the Defense Calculator, but the production costs were significantly higher than projected. To cover costs, IBM had to double the monthly lease rate. To the “total amazement”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; of Watson Jr., customers paid the higher price. Clearly, demand for the product existed. “Customers wanted computers so badly that we could double the price and still not drive people away,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt; according to Watson Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the annual shareholders meeting in April 1952, IBM announced with great fanfare the release of an electronic machine, no longer named the Defense Calculator, but the IBM 701. Among the 150 top scientists and business leaders attending the ceremony was J. Robert Oppenheimer. He described the 701 as “a tribute to the mind’s high splendor.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; In the promotional material, IBM claimed the new machine would “shatter the time barrier confronting technicians working on vital defense projects.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet before the IBM 701 came off the production line in December 1952, it earned another name, not of its choosing, but from the power of the new medium of television. On election night November 1952, CBS made public display of its use of a UNIVAC computer to predict election results.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt; That night, the public made UNIVAC synonymous with computer. The 701 became known as IBM’s UNIVAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the 701 had an even bigger problem: it was inferior to UNIVAC. By the first 701 installation in the spring of 1953, UNIVAC had been shipping for 20 months. Even so, UNIVAC still proved more competitive than IBM management had hoped. The following table shows the 701 vastly superior in internal computing speeds, but since it used punch cards, and only punch cards, not magnetic tape as did UNIVAC, getting data into and out of the computer was significantly slower. (“ One-tenth the time on early computers was taken up in solving a problem while nine-tenths of the time was typically taken up by the card input-output and printing.”)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1953, under growing pressure to sell a commercial computer, IBM introduced the IBM 650 for delivery in December 1954. Designed by the Applied Science group, the 650 served those customers who “ did not want to make the big jump from a punched card system directly to a large-scale computer.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt; In being an easier computer to convert to and use, the 650 “changed IBM’s image from a producer of “IBM UNIVACs” to the leader in the industry.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-221-typical-computation-times-in-milliseconds&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.21 TYPICAL COMPUTATION TIMES (IN MILLISECONDS)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVAC I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IBM 701&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Transfer&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;404&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Addition&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;525&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Multiplication&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2150&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;450&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Division&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3890&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;450&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in September 1953, IBM announced the commercial version of the 701, the 702, for delivery in 1955. But the 702 also suffered when compared to the UNIVAC for it used punch cards, not magnetic tape storage, and lacked adequate memory. “Our engineers and production mangers weren’t sure how to proceed,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt; remembers Watson Jr. One answer came from another government project underway at IBM since 1952, the SAGE project.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The end of World War II did not bring to a close the impact of war making on the development of computer technologies. With the detonation of an atom bomb by the Soviet Union in 1949, the need to develop a continental air defense system to provide early warning and interception of enemy aircraft became an urgent priority. The branch of the military most responsible, the U. S. Air Force, turned to M.I.T. and the newly established Lincoln Laboratory at M.I.T for assistance. The project, code named SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment), encompassed every operation from radar sites in Northern Canada, to the system of transmitting the radar data to computers in the United States, and to the computers that would interpret the data, determine if an attack was underway and execute an appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once analyzing how enemy aircraft would be identified in the voluminous, and constantly changing, radar data, it became obvious any design would require “real-time” computational capabilities – only at the time no computer existed, nor was it known how to design one, that would meet real-time requirements. Computers were simply too slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 1952, the time had arrived to design the computer system. The Air Force authorized M.I.T. to solicit proposals with an objective to “manufacture, install and maintain several dozens of the systems – systems of unprecedented complexity which employed heretofore unproven technologies.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; The M.I.T. scientist responsible for the procurement, Jay Forrester, had led the development of the Whirlwind computer, the most advanced design of its time. (Whirlwind was the direct parent of the SAGE computer.) He held serious discussions with Remington Rand, IBM, RCA, Raytheon and Sylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lengthy debate, IBM decided to submit a bid and was awarded the contract to work with MIT Lincoln Labs to design the computer system for SAGE in October 1952. The following summer, any doubt as to the project’s importance – or urgency – evaporated when the Soviet Union detonated its first hydrogen bomb. In September 1953, IBM, RAND Corporation, Burroughs and Western Electric were named prime contractors – IBM to “to design, fabricate, support and maintain two prototype computers for the SAGE system.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IBM, SAGE represented the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art computer technologies from the most advanced computer development laboratory in the world. It also meant hiring hundreds, and soon thousands, of engineers and manufacturing personnel steeped in electronics and computers – skills and experiences essential to its transformation from punch-card to computer manufacturer. But while IBM learned, staff at Lincoln Labs suffered. Lincoln Labs personnel, used to an environment rewarding individual initiative and creativity, now had to work within a bureaucracy, and a just assembling one at that. Norman Taylor, one of Forrester’s most trusted managers remembers:”IBM seemed awful stupid to us. They were still designing circuits like radio and TV circuits.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE impacted the fortunes of IBM almost immediately. The summer of 1954 IBM engineers were struggling with how to innovate the 702 into a competitive product. One seemingly insurmountable problem turned on memory. How to provide more of it? A problem faced by all computer designers. But Forrester had conceived the solution – magnetic core memory. Upon learning of this seminal innovation, IBM announced two new computers in 1954, the 704 and 705, both with magnetic core memory. Acclaimed as a “creative masterpiece,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt; the 704 established IBM as the technological leader. Innovations included: core memory, tape storage, and the first commercial high-level programming language, FORTRAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 1955, IBM completed the SAGE computer prototype. The AN/FSQ-7, or better known as the Q7, weighed 300 tons and occupied twenty thousand feet of floor space.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; Withno guarantee of winning the production contract, Watson Jr. remembers: “I worked harder to win that contract than I worked for any other sale in my life.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt; He knew it meant government funding to finance mass production of computers within IBM. Pressing every advantage he had, Watson Jr. agreed to build a factory without a contract in hand, on only a handshake from Forrester.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though SAGE was “celebrated as one of the great technical achievements of its day,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt; it was obsolete before fully operational in 1958. Because in August 1957, the Soviet Union launched an intercontinental missile that traveled the length of Siberia and, then, in October 1957, launched Sputnik I. The Soviet Union clearly had the technology to launch missiles armed with warheads into the United States from sites in Russia. But SAGE had never been designed to detect and intercept missiles.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE may not have been the success sought by the Air Force, but IBM scored a coup. Not only did the technology transfer and learning lead to the success of the 704, which clearly established IBM as the leader in the commercial market for computers, but SAGE pushed IBM to build factories and train thousands of workers before every one else.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt; IBM had leaped from Watson Sr.’s “stodgy company” to technological leader, largely on the back of government funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the IBM 704 and the Q7 computers, the technology trajectory of computers had advanced significantly. SAGE innovations such as core memory, real-time response to multiple users, keyboard terminals, computer-to-computer communications, printed circuit board construction, and diagnostic and maintenance systems are standard features in all future computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc50&quot; href=&quot;#fn50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt; Even so, computer technologies remained in their infancy, because they still relied on vacuum tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other events in 1956 left permanent imprints on IBM. In January 1956, IBM signed a consent decree with the Justice Department settling the 1952 anti-trust suit. IBM agreed “to divest itself of a portion of its punch-card manufacturing equipment; sell as well as rent its office machines; refrain from tie-in sales agreements for cards and machines; and move its tabulating service bureau operations to a subsidiary (Service Bureau Corp.), barred from using IBM trademarks.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt; It also had to “license competitors under its patents at reasonable royalties.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt; By the time IBM complied with this settlement, punch cards had become an unimportant technology, product category and market-structure – hardly worth four years of protracted negotiations with the justice department. But no one anticipated the transformative nature of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second event had more lasting impact. In May, Thomas Watson Jr. became CEO of IBM. He began an immediate effort to reorganize IBM – which at the time resembled a pyramid with everyone reporting to the CEO. “It wasn’t just that IBM had grown up under a single dominant founder. With the computer advance, its whole technological base was out of balance. It had to make the leap from electro-mechanical equipment – basically, the slowly changing world of the machine shop – to the galloping technology of electronics,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt; according to a Business Week article at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson Jr., Albert L. Williams, president, and Louis H. LaMotte, chairman of the executive and finance committee redesigned IBM over the summer. Williams later recalls: “’ We ended up with about 110 empty boxes in a new line-and-staff-structured management chart.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt; They picked 110 IBM executives to fill the boxes and invited them to a three-day retreat. Watson remembers: “We went in a monolith, and we emerged three days later as a modern, reasonably decentralized organization, with divisions with profit responsibility and clear lines of authority.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1957, IBM’s organizational structure consisted of four computer divisions, which in 1958 were to have revenues of $700 million – larger than all of IBM before re-organization – and four smaller divisions. The four computer divisions sub-divided responsibilities into large computers; small computers and punch-card machines; R and D; and basically everything else: sales, installation and service. Product divisions were responsible for product innovation and manufacturing. The distinctions between large and small computers eventually became a major problem – an artificial distinction introduced by IBM’s two historical development trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1956 and 1958, just as IBM asserted control of the commercial market for computers, vacuum tube technology, the basis of all First Generation computers, was about to become obsolescent as the logic component of computers. The first technological discontinuity of computers, the transistor, was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The transistor was the first of three technological discontinuities to radically alter the dynamics and structure of the computer market-structure.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt; Everyone knew an alternative had to be found to vacuum tubes if computers were to be made more reliable, faster, smaller, and consume less power and generate less heat. Driving and funding the search for an alternative was the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A transistor is a device that accomplishes the two necessary tasks of switching on-offand amplification. Switching on-off made possible the conversion of an analog signal, electricity, to the 0’s and 1’s of a digital signal. Amplification had two purposes: to let a very small current control a very large one, and to boost signals to overcome circuit noise so signals with information could be detected. And profoundly different than a vacuum tube, a transistor worked not by electrons flowing through voltage gradient, but by channeling them in semiconductor materials.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investigators lacked pure enough materials to create semiconductors. Once again the government played a major role in pushing theory into practice. During World War II, the government significantly increased funding of semiconductor research at Bell Labs, universities and industrial companies, and created MIT Radiation Laboratory to coordinate the research.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt; The war time scientific culture also encouraged communication and cooperation among all researchers – an example was a “Meeting on Germanium Crystals” held at Bell Labs on April 9, 1945 among university and industrial laboratory scientists.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc59&quot; href=&quot;#fn59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt; Three months later, Bell Labs issued an “Authorization for Work” to investigate making transistors from solid-state materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would take over two years, but on December 23, 1947, the first transistor was demonstrated at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen, experimentalist and theorist respectively, demonstrated a crude, but working, amplifying transistor made from germanium and wires. Their demonstration motivated William B. Shockley to work out the seminal principle of a solid-state transistor over the following five weeks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc60&quot; href=&quot;#fn60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt; (For their achievement, all three received the Nobel Prize.) Public announcement was delayed, however, until later in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From public announcement onward, Bell Labs, and thus AT&amp;amp;T, consistently acted to effect wide disclosure and use of transistor technology. For example, the military was told only one week before the public announcement to prevent them from blocking its release on the grounds of national security; they held seminars in the early 1950’s when they shared all they knew about transistor technology; and in 1952 they licensed the technology to all comers for a minimum royalty of 5% of sales. Those analyzing Bell Lab’s important open policy conclude Bell Labs knew the transistor was too important to keep to themselves; knew they had more to gain than lose from wide-spread use; might have suspected that the government would have forced such a policy in any case, especially in light of the Justice Department’s antitrust case filed in 1949; and such a policy was consistent with their past practice.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc61&quot; href=&quot;#fn61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt; In AT&amp;amp;T’s case, the fact that it was a monopoly mattered, based on historical practice, but more importantly, it was because AT&amp;amp;T executives truly saw themselves as a service business. This issue will be extensively explored in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the transistor had been perfected by an organization committed to appropriating every advantage from its innovation, not in making the innovation “public property,” then the subsequent growth in the semiconductor, and all related, including computer industries, would certainly have been very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transistor was not the only possible alternative to the vacuum tube; and again, the government funded competitive investigations. Three of the most promising alternatives were thyratribs (hot filament gas tubes), tronodes (miniature bi-stable neon gas tubes) and magnetic amplifiers (iron-cored or ferrite-cored inductors). Magnetic amplifiers were pursued most aggressively by Remington Rand and subsequently Sperry Rand, although also by IBM, Burroughs, Raytheon and Logistics Research Corporation. In a press release in 1956, Sperry Rand hailed their perfection of high-speed magnetic amplifiers, brand named FERRACTORS, and stated: “The computer opens up an era in which filament tubes and transistors will be outmoded by devices of this kind.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc62&quot; href=&quot;#fn62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt; The computers introduced by Sperry Rand in 1960 (UNIVAC SS80/90) and 1961 (UNIVAC SS80/90 II) were made with magnetic amplifiers. Not until December 1961 did Sperry Rand introduce a transistorized computer (UNIVAC 490), two years after IBM had introduced theirs (IBM 7070). Sperry Rand’s protracted commitment to magnetic amplifiers proved to be a failed strategy. In their case, it contributed to their continuing inability to re-establish market leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1952, Western Electric (and a few other firms) manufactured approximately 90,000 point-contact transistors, which were sold primarily to the military.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc63&quot; href=&quot;#fn63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt; Data from 1955 to 1960 clearly shows the importance of government purchases. See Table below. Two important sources of demand were the early commitment of the Air Force to use semiconductors in the Minuteman Missile in 1958, and the growth of IBM – the largest customer of every semiconductor company. (Note: Table is all devices not just transistors where the percent government purchases was much higher.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-222-government-purchases-of-semiconductor-devices-1955-1960&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.22 Government Purchases of Semiconductor Devices 1955-1960&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total semiconductor shipments ($ millions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipments to federal government ($ millions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government share of total shipments (%)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1955&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;38&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1956&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;90&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1957&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;151&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1958&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;210&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1959&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;396&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;180&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1960&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;542&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;258&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Richard R. Nelson, Government and Technical Progress: A Cross-Industry Analysis (Pergamon Press, 1982), 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to manufacturing transistors for sale, AT&amp;amp;T’s Bell Labs built the first transistorized computer, the TRADIC, finished in January 1954 and funded by the Air Force. Bell Labs disclosed TRADIC in a paper presented at a conference in December 1954.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did IBM master transistors? The answer, predictably enough – with the help of the government, but with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1955, IBM lost out to Remington Rand in the bid to build a super fast computer – intended to be 100 times faster than the UNIVAC I – for the University of California Radiation Laboratory (UCRL) [now the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]. By then Remington Rand was a division of Sperry Rand.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc64&quot; href=&quot;#fn64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt; Code named LARC, Sperry Rand expected to deliver the computer in February 1958. (It would take until 1960, and $19 million, not the estimated $2.85 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc65&quot; href=&quot;#fn65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt; A key mistake was using magnetic amplifiers – they had to redesign again using transistors.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If LARC was to be the next, newest, fastest, state-of-the-art computer architecture, an architecture based on a component other than vacuum tubes – how could IBM stay competitive if it also did not invest to learn and master the required technological innovations? What would be the best computer architecture using transistors? And how well would it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM set out to sell a computer design to be delivered under contract to a competitive government laboratory, one doing the computationally intensive work of nuclear research, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. A year later, in November 1956, LANL accepted their proposal. The project would be named STRETCH, meaning to extend the boundaries of state-of-the-art computing. It was an opportunity to “rethink” and “redesign” a computer’s architecture using transistors, without needing to be compatible with their existing architectures. The objective: a computer 100 times more powerful&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc66&quot; href=&quot;#fn66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt; than the 704.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the first operational transistor computer, the Burroughs Atlas Mod 1-J1 Guidance Computer built for the Air Force, had been delivered in April 1955, although not operational until September 1957. The first available commercial transistor computer was the General Electric 210 in June 1959. IBM announced theirs, the 7070, in September 1958; RCA, theirs, the 501, in December 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market-structure of First Generation mainframe computers (1950-1959) consisted of only seven companies and 31 computer models. Other companies developed computers, but they did not sell them commercially. Research and development funding came almost entirely from the U. S. Government. Over 100 computers were “completed on an experimental or contract basis for special uses.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc67&quot; href=&quot;#fn67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt; Although a commercial computer market existed, it was far from clear what its economic potential might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transistor, as a technological discontinuity, as the economist Joesph Schumpeter might describe it&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc68&quot; href=&quot;#fn68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt; , would strike “not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms, but at their foundations and their very lives.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc69&quot; href=&quot;#fn69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; In the case of transistors, once firms started making computers with transistors, they never again used vacuum tubes.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The Second Generation of computing differed from the First in a number of important ways. First, computer companies still relied on government money to fund innovation, but with the Second Generation, they also tried to sell the computers commercially. Second, efforts to sell computers stimulated both new demand as well as new competition. Third, the sales of computers entered a period of astounding growth, going from approximately $600 million in 1960 to $7 billion by 1968. (See Appendix 1 Computers and Terminals.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc70&quot; href=&quot;#fn70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; Government purchases of computers and funding of research and development no longer dominated the economics of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1959, IBM introduced the IBM 7090. In shipping it before the 7070, the 7090 became IBM’s first Second Generation computer – and a very successful one. The 7090 benefited immensely from the STRETCH project (to become the IBM 7030 computer), most importantly in the use of transistors, not vacuum tubes; although other STRETCH influenced componentry included transmission circuits, new printed circuit board designs, frames, power supplies and memories.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc71&quot; href=&quot;#fn71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt; In designing the 7090 to be used with its other computers, especially transistorized 1620’s and 1401’s, IBM gave birth to the “family” concept. Quickly, IBM pushed its competitive advantage, introducing a series of models: (except the 7070, 7080, and 1410), the 7040, and 7044, all able to function easily with each other.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt; IBM overwhelmed the competition with market-targeted computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRETCH, however, looked like a failure at the time. When delivered in 1961, it allegedly lost IBM more than $40 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc73&quot; href=&quot;#fn73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt; Watson Jr. writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking back, I think STRETCH was so ambitious that it is a wonder we got it built at all. But when it came out in 1961, behind schedule and only 60 percent as powerful as planned, I was disappointed and irate. I thought our engineers needed to be taught a lesson about not letting customers down. So, in the course of a press conference at an industry convention, I announced that the new computer had failed to meet specifications, and that I was hereby cutting the price on the machine from $13.5 million to $8 million to reflect its performance. We couldn’t make any money at that price, and before long the project got shelved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making an example out of STRETCH shook up the engineers all right, but it turned out to be a grievous mistake. The engineers understood me to be saying, “No more of those big machines around here,” and it was true that I would have snapped at anybody who brought up the subject. So for two years IBM did almost nothing in supercomputing, leaving the field wide open for Norris and his men [Control Data Corporation]&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc74&quot; href=&quot;#fn74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though a financial loss, and unwittingly creating the conditions for a future problem with the family concept, STRETCH resulted in many new technological developments within IBM, including: new architectural concepts and designs, better transistors, a way to assemble transistors into standardized modules called Micro Module Integrated Circuits or MMIC’s, the use of an eight bit byte, and a shared way of using peripheral devices.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc75&quot; href=&quot;#fn75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt; IBM also enhanced organizational competencies, such as managing large development projects, and continued to assemble assets to mass produce computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Generation mainframe computer market-structure consisted of sixteen companies. All seven first generation companies were joined by a diversified group of new entrants, including Philco, Control Data Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sylvania, Bendix, TRW, Scientific Data Systems, General Precision, Hughes Aircraft and, yes, General Mills! Forty eight different computer models were introduced by the major players. IBM, the dominant firm, accounted for eleven of them, or nearly 25%. Sperry Rand introduced eight new models. Every serious competitor introduced at least two models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the nature of market competition, an article titled “Can IBM keep up the pace?” in Fortune, February 2, 1963 said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IBM is making a lot of money in the computer business. Its competitors, on the other hand, are having a hard time. It has something like 70% to 80% of the market – only the company itself knows for sure. IBM got into trouble before on charges of dominating the punch card tabulating business. Will antitrust history repeat itself?&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc76&quot; href=&quot;#fn76&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article goes on to say, however, that important differences exist between the conditions of the tabulating equipment market and that of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For one thing, its competitors now are a lot stronger, and two of them – General Electric Co. and Ford Motor Co., which owns Philco Corp. – are much bigger. Highly diversified and only slightly smaller competitors, such as RCA, Sperry Rand Corp., and Litton have exceptional staying power. Both National Cash Register Co. and Burroughs Corp. have good marketing positions to work from and are increasing their sales. Control Data Corp., one of the few independents in the field, is a profitable company. Without the collapse of several of these competitors – which no one in or out of IBM thinks very likely – it is hard to imagine an antitrust action against IBM alone that would not be extremely punitive.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc77&quot; href=&quot;#fn77&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performance improvement of the computer trajectory from First to Second Generation computers was tenfold. As measured in thousands of commercial transactions per second,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc78&quot; href=&quot;#fn78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt; the IBM 7094 (1962), the best Second Generation computer performed one hundred thousand whereas the IBM 709 (1958), best First Generation computer, did ten thousand. By way of comparison, the STRETCH computer did six hundred and thirty thousand transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History will prove that computers had hardly begun their performance ascent. And as for the balance of market power, the next technological discontinuity, the integrated circuit, would bring about the total domination by IBM.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Transistors represented a major improvement over vacuum tubes, but were not without problems of their own. Transistors came packaged as one transistor per each small “pot.” The pots were much smaller than vacuum tubes, hence more devices could be squeezed into the same space. But as the desired complexity of device interconnections kept growing, wiring all these small devices became an interconnection nightmare, and very costly. From the years 1952-1959, firms and governments around the world searched for an answer to the problem of interconnections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the revolutionary solution, the integrated circuit, begins at Bell Labs in the years following the invention of the transistor. As discussed, Bell Labs followed an open policy of diffusing transistor technology. Unwittingly, they also served as the most important source of trained personnel; personnel who saw the economic implications of the transistor. Two of the most celebrated to leave were Gordon Teal in 1952 and William Shockley in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Haggerty, the CEO of Texas Instruments (TI), recruited Teal in 1953 to be director of TI’s Central Research Laboratory. The charge was to innovate mass produced inexpensive transistors.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc79&quot; href=&quot;#fn79&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt; Teal who had developed some of the earliest techniques to purify germanium, started work immediately to develop sufficiently pure silicon and with it to fabricate silicon transistors. In 1954, TI began selling silicon to others, and by 1956, had perfected a relatively inexpensive silicon transistor.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc80&quot; href=&quot;#fn80&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt; (In 1954, a single silicon transistor sold for $23.95, while the only alternative, a transistor made of germanium sold for $3.56. TI’s goal of a $2.50 transistor took until 1963.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc81&quot; href=&quot;#fn81&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc82&quot; href=&quot;#fn82&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1958, TI made the propitious decision to hire Jack Kilby. Within two months, he conceived of the solution to interconnecting large numbers of transistors and other components. Kilby’s idea would come to be known as the”Monolithic Idea” – “a complete circuit would consist of one part – a single (“monolithic”) block of semiconductor material containing all the components and all the interconnections of the most complex circuit designs.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc83&quot; href=&quot;#fn83&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt; By September 1958, Kilby had by hand fabricated an “integrated circuit.” TI filed for a patent in February 1959. But Kilby was not alone. For best deserving the credit for this revolutionary innovation is Robert Noyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Noyce’s story also begins at Bell Labs. In early 1956, William B. Shockley, left Bell Labs to start Shockley Transistor Laboratories in Palo Alto, California – the future Silicon Valley. Shockley then recruited legendary names in the history of semiconductors, including Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore and Jean Hoerni, to join his firm. But Shockley was no executive, and before long, eight of the recruits were terribly dissatisfied, and made it known they would prefer a new home. The new home came not, however, from being employed by an existing company, but as owners of a new firm, one funded with venture capital. It was to be the legendary, virtual fountain of future semiconductor companies, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, formed in early 1957.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc84&quot; href=&quot;#fn84&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noyce is considered the father of the integrated circuit because he not only conceived of the Monolithic Idea, as had Kilby, but also the means of manufacture - the planar process. Fairchild’s patent was filed in July 1959. The problem of interconnecting transistors had been solved. Ever since, the path of innovation has been to make device and interconnection features smaller, and the resultant integrated circuit, or chip, bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrated circuit was not an overnight success for one simple reason: they cost too much to make. Then in May 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged the imagination of the American public to put a man on the moon. To do so would require the use of integrated circuits. Through 1964, purchases of integrated circuits for the Apollo space craft computer and the Air Force Minuteman ICBM [Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]guidance computer drove the market for integrated circuits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc85&quot; href=&quot;#fn85&quot;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt; See Table below.

Nelson, Government and Technical Progress: A Cross-Industry Analysis, 63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the government had committed two critical programs to integrated circuits, into 1963 there remained sharp debate as to whether integrated circuits were the ultimate solution. But by then the costs of manufacturing integrated circuits were in steep decline, due to the volume purchases by the government, and any doubt as to their being produced or reliability was dispelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new computer start-up, Scientific Data Systems, founded in 1961 by Max Palevsky, was the first to introduce a computer using integrated circuits. The SDS 92 shipped in 1964.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc86&quot; href=&quot;#fn86&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt; IBM did not ship a computer using integrated circuits until 1969.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc87&quot; href=&quot;#fn87&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt; The stories of both SDS’s and IBM’s decision to use integrated circuits will be told below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, corporate executives – the customers leasing or buying computers from the growing computer market-structure – were being challenged to change how they managed the “modern” corporation, and how to use computers to do it. That story is next.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The transition from a Government dominated to competitively decided computer market-structure occurred in the early 1960’s. Until then, Government created buying demand by purchasing product and stimulated technological innovation by funding R&amp;amp;D. It both pulled and pushed the market. But by the middle of the 1960’s, local interactions among increasingly informed commercial customers and aggressively motivated computer firms dictated market dynamics. To better understand the coming changes to the computer market-structure through the 1980’s requires insight into why and how companies first computerized. It was the 1960’s when organizations began integrating computers into the very nature of how they did business, and in the process drove computer revenues from $600 million in 1960 to $7 billion in 1968 – a compounded growth rate of 36 percent a year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc88&quot; href=&quot;#fn88&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No two companies computerized in exactly the same way. Each differed in their needs, objectives, the year started, the computer systems they used, and, of course, their unique human and organizational competencies and resources. However, once a corporation began using computers, the patterns of subsequent use were much the same for all companies. Invariably, saving money was the initial justification for computerization. Making better decisions came next. Once executives became dependent on computers, they then wanted the information on-line. Finally, by the early 1970’s, integrated systems became the drive to computerize.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc89&quot; href=&quot;#fn89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt; These four rationales, or stages of use, will now be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first reason to computerize, to save money, treated the computer as just another piece of capital equipment. If return on investment (ROI) calculations based on costs and savings exceeded the corporate hurdle rate, the investment was made. Large bureaucratic organizations employing large numbers of people, generating volumes of routine “operational” data, found it easy to identify personnel cost savings. Hence, banks and insurance companies were the first to computerize. Just as they had been the first to make extensive use of punch card systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The save money logic was compelling during a time when the clerical workforce in American industry was growing rapidly. From Census Bureau reporting, the number of people working in clerical or closely related jobs had grown to 1 out of every 7 workers by 1958, in contrast to 1 out of every 20 in 1910, and 1 out of every 10 in 1940.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc90&quot; href=&quot;#fn90&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; In 1958, nine million people worked in clerical positions. Aiding in identifying cost savings in clerical “paper pushing systems” were “time and motion” studies based on the principles of industrial management best reflected in the theory and work of Frederick W. Taylor.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc91&quot; href=&quot;#fn91&quot;&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When organizations first computerized, the departments involved generally retained total responsibility. But soon Data Processing (DP) departments were created with corporate-wide responsibility to assure best, and shared, use of computers. The emergence of DP departments clearly indicated executives were beginning to view computers as necessary to the conduct of business.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc92&quot; href=&quot;#fn92&quot;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt; Even so, these first efforts were about keeping information, not using information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effect of computerization on corporations was theorized as a trend to “recentralization” – more executive management control. This stood in contrast to the “decentralization” underway since before World War II.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc93&quot; href=&quot;#fn93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt; With mainframe computers housed at corporate headquarters, executives no longer needed to disperse authority to where record keeping was performed. Instead, using the information residing on the co-located computers, executives found they could exert direct influence throughout their organizations. And once having absorbed the costs of a computer, the motivation became to extend use to new problems or opportunities. (Economically speaking, new computer applications only had to be justified using variable costs, the fixed costs of the computer having already been accounted for.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurrent with the processing of more and more company data, a new rationale justifying computer use emerged – making better decisions. The premise was that executives could make better decisions using formal techniques. Techniques were means of segmenting, analyzing, and finding solutions to problems – improving the likelihood of better decisions. Better decisions resulted in competitive advantage, superior innovation, more profits, etc. – all justifications for further investment in computers and techniques. Making better decisions significantly broadened the concept of computer use beyond simply lowering operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new techniques were known as “operations research.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc94&quot; href=&quot;#fn94&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt; Operations research dates to World War II, and, to more than anyone else, John von Neumann, the very same man who conceived the concept of the “stored-program” computer. In 1944, von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern published “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.” No single event did more to create operations research.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc95&quot; href=&quot;#fn95&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt; Game theory applies mathematics to understanding and “solving” problems of interest conflict.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc96&quot; href=&quot;#fn96&quot;&gt;96&lt;/a&gt; During the war, problems such as the design of shipping convoys, or deciding how many tanks the Germans could build were the focus. After the war, game theory found a welcome home in a world in which man viewed himself as competitively constrained, operating in an increasingly complicated and complex world, and with economic gain to turn on right decisions. Theories initially assumed man was “rational” and had “perfect information.” With time, others objected – arguing decision makers did not have perfect information but instead had “limited knowledge and skills.” In 1957, Herbert Simon introduced the concept of satisficingas an alternative, more realistic, way of viewing decision making than one of finding the “perfect” answer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc97&quot; href=&quot;#fn97&quot;&gt;97&lt;/a&gt; “Bounded rationality” would come in the future. Many techniques besides game theory comprise operations research including: decision theory, linear programming, dynamic programming, Bayesian analysis, PERT, and CPM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marriage of techniques and computers were soon used to inform more than acts of deciding. They contributed to the notion of viewing an organization as a whole.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc98&quot; href=&quot;#fn98&quot;&gt;98&lt;/a&gt; By building computer models of the entire organization, then performing sensitivity analysis – seeing how changes would affect the whole – it became possible to study both strategic and tactical implications. Arising coterminously were planning and strategic development departments. Organizations began prioitizing the hiring and training of technically-trained personnel, particularly management.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc99&quot; href=&quot;#fn99&quot;&gt;99&lt;/a&gt; Computers and their consequences represented an effort to cope with an increasingly complex world, while at the same time, contributing to its complexity. Reflective of the challenges, the discipline of management science emerged – one deeply influenced by operations research and the growing presence of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet cries of protest were heard.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc100&quot; href=&quot;#fn100&quot;&gt;100&lt;/a&gt; Management was much more than techniques and algorithms embedded in computer programs, these critics reminded all. They voiced concerns about the character and humaneness of the future work place. In short, computerizing everything did not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DP departments gained in stature and influence as organizations succeeded in using computers for more than saving operational costs. Reflecting this new importance, DP departments became Management Information System (MIS) departments – connoting the transition from keeping information to managing the use of information. A self-organizing “fraternity” emerged among those selling computers, MIS professionals, trade personnel and, frequently, academics. This fraternity had a language and sub-culture of its own, one stressing technical competencies not the skills of general management – a difference often distancing MIS professionals from corporate executives. Nevertheless, few executives were willing to run the risk of not computerizing, leaving them little choice but to hope their MIS professionals would get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once executives experienced the value of the timeliness of information, they wanted all the information immediately, real-time – on-line. But Second Generation computers were too slow and under-powered to support on-line performance. It was the same issue confronting those designing SAGE – the users wanted to interact directly with the computer and get results immediately. Second and First Generation computers executed in a mode known as “batch processing” – the exact opposite of on-line, real time. Batch processing forced the user to submit a job, or request, to the MIS department which processed each request within priorities. Results were given to the user, later, after the fact. To executives needing answers now, batch processing would not suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did corporate executives feel the need for on-line information? Because by the early 1960’s, the pace of change for business was accelerating, even if executives were not entirely sure why. In 1965, H. Igor Ansoff wrote in the Harvard Business Review: “The 20-year period since World War II has seen a continuing acceleration of product change. Triggered by accumulated technology and pent-up consumer demand, product innovation has become an increasingly important tool of competition and growth. To the business manager it has brought both opportunities and problems.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc101&quot; href=&quot;#fn101&quot;&gt;101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another measure of this change, between 1946 and 1961, corporate research and development expenditures rose from $1.2 billion to $10 billion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc102&quot; href=&quot;#fn102&quot;&gt;102&lt;/a&gt; The rapid proliferation of products, shorter product life cycles, the emergence of entirely new markets, slowing growth in more traditional markets, and globalization of everything&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc103&quot; href=&quot;#fn103&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt; all contributed to the felt need by executives for not only computers, but computers capable of giving immediate answers. The power of the Third Generation salesman’s pitch came from the fact that it resonated with the executives concerns and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their salvation, so IBM told them on April 7, 1964, simply required upgrading to their new family of computers – the System/360. Only the System/360 proved to be exactly the opposite. It was a cataclysm. To those users with a prior investment in computers, it meant throwing away whatever they had done. To those just computerizing, and most users were just computerizing,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc104&quot; href=&quot;#fn104&quot;&gt;104&lt;/a&gt; the experience was traumatic. To all, it became a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the beleaguered MIS departments managing the upgrade to the System/360, which meant mastering an operating system, rewriting all their existing application programs, changing over almost all their hardware, training and hiring personnel, and delivering on new applications that were often the justification for upgrading the computer in the first place,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc105&quot; href=&quot;#fn105&quot;&gt;105&lt;/a&gt; the experience was overwhelming. Trained, let alone experienced, people were no where to be found. There simply were none. Executives knowing the risks and consequences of failure, could do little more than hope, having no prior computer management experience. And no one could have anticipated the problems of trying to create an operational system in the face of constant system software changes. It was not until around 1968 before the system software for the System/360 was considered reliable, even if not functioning as originally promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into the maelstrom it had created jumped IBM declaring: “We will make it work.” And they did. It is calculated to have cost them $5 billion to do so – the largest investment in a new product up to then in American corporate history. No other firm could have risked such an investment. And in the process, IBM gained a head-lock on the market, forming long-lasting bonds with MIS departments and personnel. MIS departments using IBM computers were known as “Big Blue Shops.” (After the blue of IBM’s corporate image and their machines.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bonds between IBM and customers’ MIS departments were rooted in mutual inter-dependence. The more successful IBM was in selling computers to MIS departments, the more likely MIS departments controlled computerization in their companies. (MIS departments increased their control when they, not user departments, bought and managed the computers.) And the more control and influence MIS departments had, the more likely their budgets were to grow to buy more computers from IBM. The interdependence was inherent to the technology IBM was selling – big, expensive computers that had to exist behind air-conditioned, “glass” walls, and drove the corporate information architecture to centralized operations, the province of the MIS department.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc106&quot; href=&quot;#fn106&quot;&gt;106&lt;/a&gt; IBM reinforced these interdependencies in their practice of account control – each customer felt special and capable of calling on the resources of all of IBM. The cumulative results became structural inertia blinding both IBM and MIS departments to first minicomputers, and then more importantly, to personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create on-line computing required the connection of computer distant terminals to host computers. This need drove the innovation of early computer communication products and the emergence of a data communications market-structure – a story to be told in later chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the conversion to Third Generation computers by large organizations was being completed, roughly between 1968 to 1972, a new rationale for extending computer use emerged, one affecting the very ways companies would function and be organized: integrated systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1967 survey by the management consulting firm of Booz, Allen &amp;amp; Hamilton, published in 1968, reports: “the computer increasingly is penetrating and permeating all areas of major manufacturing corporations.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc107&quot; href=&quot;#fn107&quot;&gt;107&lt;/a&gt; The evolution in use of computers by large organizations was now extending to every operation and activity. Not surprisingly, the next objective was for them to all work together as integrated systems. The counsel from MIS remained one of a hierarchically organized information system. The justification for using computers had become so compelling that when alternatives to mainframe computers became available, they too could be justified. Before long the sheer numbers of computers being used by corporations eroded the paradigm of centralized computing institutionalized in MIS departments in late 69 and early 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers had been adapted to so many organizational activities, they had become indispensable. Organizations became thought of as information processors. “Organizations were no longer predominantly human systems,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc108&quot; href=&quot;#fn108&quot;&gt;108&lt;/a&gt; write Bonczek, et al (1981) of this period. Once computerized, existing organizations could do more, better, and smaller organizations could perform much larger than their headcount would historically indicate. Consequently, firms selling services to other organizations became a growth sector – representing one out of every seven jobs in1985 versus one out of every ten in 1969.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc109&quot; href=&quot;#fn109&quot;&gt;109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most dramatic indication of how important computers had become since 1960, when their use was simply to save money, was that by 1967, executives felt if they didn’t exploit computer systems, their competitors would to their disadvantage. The same Booz, Allen &amp;amp; Hamilton survey concludes: “ The day may not be far distant when those who analyze annual business failures can add another category to their list of causes – failure to exploit the computer.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc110&quot; href=&quot;#fn110&quot;&gt;110&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brief period of a decade, (1960-1970) corporate America’s attitude towards computers went from a piece of capital equipment used to save clerical labor costs, to the cornerstone of the business. The transition to the ultimate objective, having a “fully” integrated computer system, required two intermediate steps – using computers to make better decisions and on-line information. For most companies it would take until the 1980’s to complete the task – then only to find the task begin again. Firms, meaning Big Blue Shops, entered the 1980’s having evolved an information infrastructure both centric and hierarchical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIS departments emerged as computers became essential to the modern business corporation. For example, by 1976, salaries were the largest cost of computerization. When corporate overhead is added, the second largest source of costs, the combined are proxy for the cost of internal infrastructure – $17.9 billion, or 46% of all costs. See the following table – Table 1.0 1976 Computer Expenditures by Using Organizations. But in the 1980’s, technological and competitive advances prove the MIS structure to be structural inertia to the dynamics of distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-224-1976-computer-expenditures-by-using-organizations--billions-111&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.24 1976 Computer Expenditures by Using Organizations ($ billions) &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc111&quot; href=&quot;#fn111&quot;&gt;111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Corporate overhead allocation&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Rentals &amp;amp; leases&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Services&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;General purpose computer systems&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data communication equipment &amp;amp; lines&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Software packages &amp;amp; facilities&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1.7&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Minicomputers&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1.5&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data Entry Equipment&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1.4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Supplies&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1.2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total User Spending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38.9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now to the story of IBM and the System/360.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 1964, Thomas Watson Jr. and the management of IBM made the most important product announcement in their company’s history.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc112&quot; href=&quot;#fn112&quot;&gt;112&lt;/a&gt; IBM would begin shipping six models of a revolutionary new computer architecture named the System/360 in April 1965. At a cost to IBM of an estimated $5 billion, the System/360 represented the transition to the Third Generation of mainframe computers, traumatized IBM’s customers, and sent IBM’s competitors scrambling for survival. The effect was so cataclysmic as to preclude IBM from ever again introducing a new computer system that was incompatible with its existing computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc113&quot; href=&quot;#fn113&quot;&gt;113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1960, IBM’s internal organizational structure mirrored the major segmentation in the market for computers: beginning computers and large general purpose computers. IBM’s two computer divisions – the General Products Division (GPD) selling beginners’ computers, and the Data Systems Division (DSD) selling general purpose scientific and business computers – reflected external market segmentation because the two had co-evolved. But IBM’s organizational structure had become a source of serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPD sat pretty. In 1960, the 1401 was the”most popular” IBM computer according to Fortune Magazine, 1966,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc114&quot; href=&quot;#fn114&quot;&gt;114&lt;/a&gt; and division management felt they would not need an improved 1401 until 1968 – a strong indication that management feared no threat of innovation from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same could not be said for DSD. DSD management knew they had to respond to competitors’ technological improvements, and soon. The 7000 series of computers needed to be upgraded – preferably to a new generation of products. The question was to what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1961, DSD executives sought authority to begin developing the 8000 series – designed to succeed the 7000 series. But IBM’s corporate management committee said no. To some key members of the committee, the 8000 represented more continued product proliferation. And even though IBM had achieved market leadership by, in part, a proliferation of products, it had to end. The proliferation of models, each of which was to some degree a unique development effort, had become unmanageable. Furthermore, GPD and DSD increasingly competed with each other. The concerned executives wanted most of all to sell one computer architecture to the full spectrum of customer requirements, all using the same peripherals and software. They argued the moment called for “drastic simplification.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc115&quot; href=&quot;#fn115&quot;&gt;115&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate management first turned to their Advanced Systems Development Division – the division responsible for innovating technologies for future products. Their recommendation to use cryogenic technologies was rejected as well.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc116&quot; href=&quot;#fn116&quot;&gt;116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By August 1961, Watson Jr. and Learson, CEO and COO respectively, were concerned because an alternative to the 8000 had not been created. They started an investigation. (Their anxiety, no doubt, increased knowing it was the same management team that had bungled the STRETCH project.) Their suspicions that no new architecture was being created were confirmed. In November, they convened a task force of thirteen senior officers to recommend action. On the fourth of January, 1962, the task force gave their recommendations to Watson Jr. and Learson. As reported by Fortune Magazine a few years later (1966):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;There was a definite need for a single, compatible family of computers.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The new line should not be aimed at simply at replacing the popular 1401 or 7000 series, but at opening up whole new fields of computer applications.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The System/360 must have both business and scientific applications.Information input and output equipment, and all other peripheral equipment, must have a “standard interface.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc117&quot; href=&quot;#fn117&quot;&gt;117&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report estimated $125 million in programming costs at a time when IBM spent $10 million a year in programming. After hearing the recommendations and discussion, Learson concluded: “All right, we’ll do it.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc118&quot; href=&quot;#fn118&quot;&gt;118&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple declarative – “All right, we’ll do it.” – the one that cost $5 billion – dramatically changed IBM. According to Fortune Magazine, the shift “plunged I.B.M. into an organizational upheaval.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc119&quot; href=&quot;#fn119&quot;&gt;119&lt;/a&gt; IBM, forced in part by competitive pressure, yet also incentivized by confidence in the economic potential latent in innovating computers, transformed itself into a new company. In tackling the System/360 project, IBM used a development project to recast itself, and the economic and technical world in which it competed. The article goes on to list some I.B.M. changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The company, which was essentially an assembler of computer components and a business-service organization, has now also become a major manufacturing concern as well.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The view now is that I.B.M. is a fully integrated international company, in which the managers of overseas units are presumed to have the same capabilities and responsibilities as those in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Now a new group of technically oriented executives has come to the forefront for the first time, diluting some of the traditional power of marketing men in the corporation.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;I.B.M.’s balance sheet has a new look.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc120&quot; href=&quot;#fn120&quot;&gt;120&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investing in large-scale production, distribution channels, and management structures, IBM had secured “first-mover” advantages.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc121&quot; href=&quot;#fn121&quot;&gt;121&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovating the System/360 required a new computer architecture(s) as well as the mastery of important new component technologies – performance objectives could not be met using then current component technologies. Previous work on the STRETCH proved invaluable.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc122&quot; href=&quot;#fn122&quot;&gt;122&lt;/a&gt; Innovations included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Not just an operating system, but a common one across all models.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc123&quot; href=&quot;#fn123&quot;&gt;123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Six models all to be introduced at once. The internal decision making and organization coordination were unprecedented.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Able to process both business and scientific applications.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Common Input/Output interfaces across all models.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Standardization on an eight-bit byte architecture, and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;First commercial use of MIMC technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last three came directly from STRETCH. To be discussed will be MIMC. The importance of the eight-bit byte will resurface later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The System/360 had to be built with post-transistor component integration if the performance objectives were to be achieved. IBM was fully aware of the developments in integrated circuits. It also had its own experience building hybrid integrated circuitry for STRETCH called MIMC. In MIMC, transistors and diodes were still made separately. Then they were soldered into place into modules, which were then assembled together on printed circuit boards. The task force assigned to recommend use of either integrated circuits or MIMC decided IBM could not scale manufacturing of integrated circuits rapidly enough to meet production schedules, and recommended the less risky MIMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the System/360 and MIMC, IBM bought standard components from manufacturers such as Texas Instruments. IBM then assembled the components, by wiring them together, to construct the computer architecture and create a computer. With MIMC, IBM had to make a decision. If they contracted with independent manufacturers to construct the MIMC modules, they were giving proprietary design knowledge away. The alternative was to manufacture the MIMCs themselves. “Unless we did it ourselves, we could be turning over some of the essentials of our business to another company,” said Watson Jr. in Fortune Magazine.”We had no intention of doing that.” I.B.M. also then captured the profits of manufacturing, a significant amount if the System/360 was to be as successful as they thought.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc124&quot; href=&quot;#fn124&quot;&gt;124&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a single computer architecture – made possible by one, common operating system – it no longer made sense to be organized into a General Products and Data Systems divisions. GPD and DSD were combined into the Data Processing Group, which, according to a 1968 article in Business Week, accounted for “ 79% of IBM’s sales and at least 85% of earnings.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc125&quot; href=&quot;#fn125&quot;&gt;125&lt;/a&gt; The DP group was further organized into four regions, with specialized units in thirteen industry sectors and one unit for each major type of 360.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc126&quot; href=&quot;#fn126&quot;&gt;126&lt;/a&gt; IBM would be competing with one voice, coordinated by territory and supported by industry sector and 360 type personnel.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc127&quot; href=&quot;#fn127&quot;&gt;127&lt;/a&gt; The scale and scope of attention IBM was able to bring to an average sale would dwarf whatever any competitor could do. As evidence of IBM’s dominant market-structure position, in 1969, IBM was shipping “over 1,000 model 360 systems a month.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc128&quot; href=&quot;#fn128&quot;&gt;128&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The System/360 had a profound affect on both IBM’s customers and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IBM’s customers, the System/360 was a nightmare. MIS managers had to sell a sizable new capital expense, fight for increased operating expenses, re-write essentially all of their application software, integrate new peripherals into operations, hire and train personnel, and manage a significantly more complicated and complex system and operations. Combined, these phenomena became known as: “reset to zero.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc129&quot; href=&quot;#fn129&quot;&gt;129&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of time, an MIS history of this period went: “In 1969, we delivered what we promised in 1967 for use in 1968. In 1964, we ordered third-generation equipment, in 1965-66 we installed it. In 1966 and 1967 we were totally devoted to converting and learning (in that order).”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc130&quot; href=&quot;#fn130&quot;&gt;130&lt;/a&gt; The problem under-estimated by IBM was software. A satisfactory, and stable, release of the operating system took until 1968 to finish. In the intervening years, the beleaguered MIS departments had to either make their old, now obsolete, systems suffice, or run their software in emulation mode on a System/360 – a painfully slow emulation mode it should be added. In a March 1966 press conference, Watson Jr. conceded that “the momentous decision to announce the entire 360 package at once in April 1964, may have been ‘ill advised’“&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc131&quot; href=&quot;#fn131&quot;&gt;131&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competition could do little at first other than wage a war of words. They argued that IBM could never deliver, it was too expensive, and it was not even state-of-the-art – it didn’t use integrated circuits, for example.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc132&quot; href=&quot;#fn132&quot;&gt;132&lt;/a&gt; But all were forced to develop Third Generation product lines to stay competitive. One way competitors tried to differentiate their products from System/360 was timesharing – largely because IBM did not support timesharing in the announced System/360s. That story and other competitive responses comes next. It should become clear that IBM not only transformed itself with the System/360, it transformed the market-structure of mainframe computers as well.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Timesharing as an idea first surfaced in the late 1950’s. Frustrated with batch-processing, scientists and computer programmers sought ways to interact directly with the computer. In 1959, Christopher Strachey, a British mathematician, gave the first public paper on time-sharing at a UNESCO congress; and, working independently, Professor John McCarthy distributed an internal memo about time-sharing at MIT. Under the leadership of F.J. Corbato, a professor at MIT, timesharing was first demonstrated at the MIT Computational Center in November 1961.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc133&quot; href=&quot;#fn133&quot;&gt;133&lt;/a&gt; There timesharing might have lingered were it not for the visionary leadership of Dr. J.C.R. Licklider and his license to invest government funds. In October 1962, Dr. Licklider became the first director of the newly created Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). His charge – to invest in advanced information technologies. Based on his experiences at MIT Lincoln Labs and Bolt, Beranek &amp;amp; Newman (BBN), and his vision of man-machine interactions,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc134&quot; href=&quot;#fn134&quot;&gt;134&lt;/a&gt; too briefly summarized as interactivity, he prioritized funding to timesharing projects. And if projects didn’t exist, he created them. For example, at MIT he helped create Project MAC, for machine-aided cognition or multiple-access computer, under the leadership of Professor Robert M. Fano. He then provided $3 million a year in funding – it would become the most influential effort in timesharing. In 1967, IPTO funding to over a dozen timesharing projects, at both universities and research organizations, exceeded an estimated $12 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc135&quot; href=&quot;#fn135&quot;&gt;135&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timesharing required creating new software and hardware from that used in batch-processing. The most challenging innovation was designing and perfecting an operating system that could support many simultaneous users – all believing they had exclusive control of the computer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc136&quot; href=&quot;#fn136&quot;&gt;136&lt;/a&gt; What made this sleight of hand possible was the speed of computers compared to that of humans. By the computer switching back and forth between programs fast enough, the illusion of both real-time and on-line was created, something operating systems designed to process programs in batch fashion would never be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first computer company to emphasize timesharing was General Electric (GE). In May 1964, a GE computer was used in a timesharing demonstration at Dartmouth College.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc137&quot; href=&quot;#fn137&quot;&gt;137&lt;/a&gt; That summer, GE announced its 600 series computers would all support timesharing; using software developed at Dartmouth. And that fall, MIT surprised everyone when it announced it would buy a GE computer for its timesharing operations. IBM, which had abandoned internal efforts to develop a timesharing system and did not support timesharing in its initial releases of System/360, scrambled.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc138&quot; href=&quot;#fn138&quot;&gt;138&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, indicative of the challenging to create a timesharing system, IBM introduced its first timesharing computer, the System 360/67. Only the 360/67 lacked compatibility with the other 360 models, a key selling point of buying into the 360 series.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc139&quot; href=&quot;#fn139&quot;&gt;139&lt;/a&gt; By then, even IBM admitted to the importance of timesharing, believing it would represent 30% of the computer market. The competition waxed even more ebulliently. GE projected that by 1970, 75% of all computers would support timesharing. Business Week projected a $2.5 billion timesharing market in five years;– up from only $20 million in 1968.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc140&quot; href=&quot;#fn140&quot;&gt;140&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timesharing contributed to the popularity of a vision of computing known as the Computer Utility. “Within the next decade electronic data centers are expected to sell computational power to the general public in a way somewhat analogous to today’s distribution of electricity,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc141&quot; href=&quot;#fn141&quot;&gt;141&lt;/a&gt; . wrote Dr. ManleyR. Irwin in 1966. Employed at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), Dr. Irwin should have known – being resident expert in computers and participant in the on-going Computer Inquiry. (See next Chapter for details.) The Computer Utility seemed a perfect metaphor in a time when computers were expensive, difficult to program, and required trained personnel who were in very short supply. If computers were going to be used by most, if not all, companies, then sharing made sense, especially given the success of the utility concept in both electricity and telephony.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc142&quot; href=&quot;#fn142&quot;&gt;142&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc143&quot; href=&quot;#fn143&quot;&gt;143&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosion in growth of computer service bureaus seemed to validate the Computer Utility concept. Service bureaus, as either independent organizations or operations of computer manufacturers, sold computer time and services to other companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc144&quot; href=&quot;#fn144&quot;&gt;144&lt;/a&gt; In 1966, an estimated 800 service bureaus generated $650 million in revenues – growing at 40% per year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc145&quot; href=&quot;#fn145&quot;&gt;145&lt;/a&gt; In a 1969 Datamation, a leading computer publication, Ralph Zani and William Zani write: “by bringing together the combined advantages of large-scale computing and communications equipment, the services [service bureaus] will surpass in capability what can be achieved with most in-house computer systems standing alone.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc146&quot; href=&quot;#fn146&quot;&gt;146&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service bureaus were not new. The most famous was IBM’s Service Bureau Corporation (SBC), which by terms of IBM’s 1956 consent decree with the Justice Department had to be managed independently of IBM. During this first phase of development, First Generation computer manufacturers used captive service bureaus as sales aids; part of their marketing strategies; a way to demonstrate products;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc147&quot; href=&quot;#fn147&quot;&gt;147&lt;/a&gt; a means to pre-install customer software, even to make it “pay-as-you-go;” and/or as a solution to overflow work from customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960’s, independent service bureaus emerged selling “generalized” systems – a single program usable by many companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc148&quot; href=&quot;#fn148&quot;&gt;148&lt;/a&gt; But the service bureaus could not provide real-time access to clients until the development of timesharing. Timesharing resulted in a boom for service bureaus and growing demand for modems and multiplexers,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc149&quot; href=&quot;#fn149&quot;&gt;149&lt;/a&gt; and the birth of the Data Communications market-structure.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc150&quot; href=&quot;#fn150&quot;&gt;150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM had no intention of being a by-stander in the service bureau business. While participating indirectly through SBC, still a part of IBM even though it could not publicize the fact, that was not enough. By 1966, IBM also ran a nationwide system of time-sharing computer centers. Dr. Irwin writes: “These new developments in technology and services raise the question, once again, of the status of IBM’s consent decree. Does time-sharing merely permit IBM to sell computer time over telephone lines, or is IBM processing customer data for a fee? What is legitimate activity for IBM as a manufacturer and IBM as a service bureau? The answers to these questions are not clear, but as if to hedge its short term anti-trust bet, both the Service Bureau Corporation and IBM, the parent corporation, have recently introduced nationwide systems of time-shared computer centers. In the long run, however, IBM many find it necessary to convince the Justice Department that new technology has invalidated major premises of its 1956 judgment.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc151&quot; href=&quot;#fn151&quot;&gt;151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, unfazed by hovering Government threat, proceeded to take a lock on the market, selling both the dominant design, the System/360, and becoming the dominant firm, in an oligopoly of one, holding a 70 to 80 per cent market share in computers – mainframe computers. A 1968 Business Week article assessed the growth of IBM: “Since it entered the computer business 15 years ago, IBM’s volume has increased 17 times (to $5.3 billion last year [1967]) and its net income has gone up 20 times (to $651.5-million). Last year, IBM zoomed past Texaco and U.S. Steel to become the nation’s eighth largest industrial company when it added $1.1-billion in revenues. That is like creating another Coca-Cola or another Celanese in just one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wall Street’s assessment, IBM is now the most valuable corporation around. Early this week, IBM’s common shares were worth $41.5-billion. The common shares of AT&amp;amp;T, with assets eight times larger, were worth $26.3-billion. The stock market appraises IBM stock as worth at least as much as the combined shares of 21 of the 30 companies that go to make up the Dow-Jones industrial average.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc152&quot; href=&quot;#fn152&quot;&gt;152&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM benefited from the public stock markets insatiable appetite for technology stocks during 1967 and 1968, but so did hundreds, if not thousands, of other companies. The valuation public investors were willing to place on a technology company by buying its stock went through the roof. One relatively new start-up, University Computing Co. of Dallas, Texas – a firm that didn’t make it – had its stock price bid up over three years from $1.50 a share (adjusted for splits) to $155.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc153&quot; href=&quot;#fn153&quot;&gt;153&lt;/a&gt; Venture capital became more widely available. New start-ups, hardly moved into their first space, were candidates to go public. Technology was the rage – where technology meant computer-related.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc154&quot; href=&quot;#fn154&quot;&gt;154&lt;/a&gt; One group of computer start-ups to be funded were minicomputer companies. But to mainframe watchers, it was as if an unrelated event…as if occurring on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then came January 1969. On the 7th, the banks raised the prime interest rate to a then record 7%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc155&quot; href=&quot;#fn155&quot;&gt;155&lt;/a&gt; Then Congress increased the capital gains tax. For anyone who did not appreciate how over priced technology stocks had become, they soon would – for the luster of technology proved more the reflection of investors’ greed than companies’ prospects. As rudely awaken as were investors were the management of the technology companies who no longer had money being thrown at them, but, once again, had to worry about cash flow and making sales. Management of private companies who had raised less money than needed to reach profitability or positive cash flow, believing that the money would be there when needed, only it would be a lot less expensive – investors would place a much higher valuation on their companies which translated into less dilution and lower cost of capital – were shocked. Many, probably most, either had to find survival in being acquired or simply closed down. The good times of 1967 and 1968 turned into the midnight years of 1969 and 1970.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc156&quot; href=&quot;#fn156&quot;&gt;156&lt;/a&gt; (These issues will be more fully explored in future chapters.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1969, Watson Jr. announced record earnings of $871 million – a 34% increase – for IBM. Revenues had increased by $1.5 billion to $6.8 billion. The very next day, on their last day in public office, Attorney General Ramsey Clark and his antitrust chief, Edwin M. Zimmerman, filed a major antitrust suit against IBM. The Justice department was not first to act, for in December 1968, Control Data Corporation filed suit charging IBM with violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Then earlier in January, Data Processing Financial &amp;amp; General sued IBM for violation of “antitrust laws, the Consent Decree of 1956, and state unfair competition laws.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc157&quot; href=&quot;#fn157&quot;&gt;157&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice department’s suit had been developing for several years and focused on the sale and leasing of general-purpose digital computers. The complaint, in spelling out the extent of IBM’s dominance of the computer market, seemed compelling. Every year from 1961 to 1967, IBM represented between 69% and 80% of the sales of computers. In 1967, while computers and related products only accounted for 43% of IBM’s revenue, or $2.3 billion, IBM constituted 74% of the total computer market. And the nearest rival held but a 5% market share, or revenues of $165 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc158&quot; href=&quot;#fn158&quot;&gt;158&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Business Week of January 25: “Essentially, the Sherman Act complaint accuses IBM of obtaining a “monopoly” by practicing manufacturing and marketing policies that deny competitors adequate opportunity in the computer market. The Justice Depart., objecting to four specific kinds of activities, claims that IBM has:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Inhibited the growth or entry of competition by maintaining a single price policy for equipment, programming, and “related support” (system engineering services and the practice of supplying extra         personnel to some customers.)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Precluded effective competition from other manufacturers for various accounts, by using the accumulated power of its “software and related support.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Introduced low-profit lines of equipment and announced new models when it “knew” that it was unlikely to be able to deliver on time.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Influenced future purchases by dominating the educational market through discriminatory price allowances to colleges and universities.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc159&quot; href=&quot;#fn159&quot;&gt;159&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Justice department’s lawsuit had been filed, Applied Data Research Inc, and Programmatics Inc., both software companies, filed as well.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc160&quot; href=&quot;#fn160&quot;&gt;160&lt;/a&gt; The focus of their complaints also targeted IBM’s practice of not separately pricing hardware and software, nor of charging for software programming services. Since customers were forced to pay for IBM’s software, whether used or not, it made it extremely difficult to convince customers to then pay for third-party software. Unless customers had the choice of not paying for IBM’s software, they argued the software market would be stunted in growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While denying any connection between their changes in policies and the antitrust suits, IBM on June 23 announced that as of January 1, 1970, they would unbundle hardware and software pricing, charge for programming services, service their equipment no matter how the customer acquired it,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc161&quot; href=&quot;#fn161&quot;&gt;161&lt;/a&gt; and charge for education courses.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc162&quot; href=&quot;#fn162&quot;&gt;162&lt;/a&gt; There still remained the question of IBM’s market dominance, but they had eliminated many of their objectionable practices. Clearly the burst of lawsuits had, if not changed IBM managements’ attitudes, forced to make them public. All competitors now had reason to rejoice as the rules of competition had now changed in their favor. Only, what would not become obvious for another few years, IBM had already achieved unassailable dominance of mainframe computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, seven companies contested IBM in mainframe computers: G.E., RCA, Burroughs, Control Data, Honeywell, National Cash Register, and Sperry Rand’s Univac division.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc163&quot; href=&quot;#fn163&quot;&gt;163&lt;/a&gt; Known as the “Seven Dwarfs,” none believed they could unseat IBM, nor was that necessary to their survival and success. What each had to do was carve out enough market share, generally thought of as ten percent, to become number two to IBM. And since none of them held more than a five percent market share, the challenge was to double their respective size, not by clobbering one another, but by taking share from IBM. But how? Two stories will be told – GE and RCA, two industrial giants with the resources and commitment to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the middle of 1969, GE’s strategy had two components: dominate timesharing and build a new line of computers compatible with the System/360. Timesharing was the easy part. Management believed that they controlled 40% of the timesharing market – through both its timesharing services as well as leases, or infrequent sale, of mainframe computers – and, if timesharing would come to represent as much as three-fourth’s of the market,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc164&quot; href=&quot;#fn164&quot;&gt;164&lt;/a&gt; as they believed, all they had to do was maintain their current share and they would be successful.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc165&quot; href=&quot;#fn165&quot;&gt;165&lt;/a&gt; Two assumptions drove their confidence in timesharing: “by the late Seventies from one-third to one-half of all computer power in the U.S. will be used for corporate strategic planning”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc166&quot; href=&quot;#fn166&quot;&gt;166&lt;/a&gt; and “within a couple of decades it will be as rare to find an in-house computer as it is to find a company-owned electric generating plant.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc167&quot; href=&quot;#fn167&quot;&gt;167&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second leg of GE’s strategy was formulated after March 1969. Newly promoted management knew GE had to respond to the System/360 and developed a plan to do so – it was code named Project Shangri-La.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc168&quot; href=&quot;#fn168&quot;&gt;168&lt;/a&gt; “Project Shangri-La very likely produced the most comprehensive and boldest master plan for an assault on IBM ever prepared,” wrote W. David Gardner in a 1970 Datamation article. GE was the only one of the Seven Dwarfs with the resources and size to take on IBM. Estimates for implementing the master plan represented a significant investment, even for GE. The low figures ran $450 to $500 million over six or seven years, covering machine design and development, as well as marketing development, but not production costs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc169&quot; href=&quot;#fn169&quot;&gt;169&lt;/a&gt; In September 1969, GE executives, emboldened with their new strategy, reaffirmed publicly their commitment to the computer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCA also premised their strategy on taking business from IBM in quest for 10% market share and the assumed number two position in the industry. L. Edwin Donegan, Jr., an exIBM’er, who became vice president and general manager of RCA’s Computer Systems Division on January 1, 1970, only one year after joining the company, was quoted as saying: “We have two options if we want to get 10% of the market. We can get a little out of the hide of each of the other Dwarfs, or we can get it out of IBM’s hide. It’s easier for us to get after IBM.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc170&quot; href=&quot;#fn170&quot;&gt;170&lt;/a&gt; Only RCA differed from GE in having essentially only one strategy – out-IBM IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once general manager, Donegan prioritized the need for a new line of computers within the year. On learning R &amp;amp; D would be of no help, the advanced computers they were developing would not be ready for at least two years, he decided to take their current Spectra series of computers, change the covers, add more memory, and introduce them as a new line.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc171&quot; href=&quot;#fn171&quot;&gt;171&lt;/a&gt; Scheduled introduction date – September 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on May 20, in “possibly the most startling event ever to occur in the computer industry,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc172&quot; href=&quot;#fn172&quot;&gt;172&lt;/a&gt; or so claimed Datamation in July, Honeywell announced it was acquiring all of GE’s computer operations except the U.S. and Canadian timesharing division.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc173&quot; href=&quot;#fn173&quot;&gt;173&lt;/a&gt; (GE management refused to sell their last toehold in computers even though offered as much as $200 million for an operation that had never been profitable.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc174&quot; href=&quot;#fn174&quot;&gt;174&lt;/a&gt; ) In exiting the mainframe computer business, GE had conceded IBM held too big a lead, too much technology and too many resources. The investment required was simply too large and too risky to chance. Market consolidation, a sure sign the dominant design and oligopolistic firms have been decided, had begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, on June 30, 1970, IBM upped the ante of competing, announcing the System/370 line of computers. The System/370 did not introduce a new generation of computers as had the 360, leaving many disappointed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc175&quot; href=&quot;#fn175&quot;&gt;175&lt;/a&gt; Instead it represented incremental improvement along the technology trajectory established by the 360. A 1970 article in Datamation entitled “IBM’s System/370 Surfaces, But Is That All There Is?” points out that”perhaps that should not have been surprising, for it is unlikely that any company – least likely IBM – will ever shake the foundations of its user audience as profoundly as IBM did with the introduction of the incompatible 360 series.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc176&quot; href=&quot;#fn176&quot;&gt;176&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc177&quot; href=&quot;#fn177&quot;&gt;177&lt;/a&gt; The article goes on to say RCA, Honeywell, and NCR had terminals and systems ready to respond to IBM’s announcement.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc178&quot; href=&quot;#fn178&quot;&gt;178&lt;/a&gt; What the article fails to see is that the scale and scope of response is insignificant given the advantages IBM had been accumulating ever since announcement of the 360 in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1970, RCA announced their new Spectra family of computers&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc179&quot; href=&quot;#fn179&quot;&gt;179&lt;/a&gt; – believing they had priced their line very attractively to IBM’s announced and to be announced products. Only RCA misfired. The machines they announced to take control of IBM’s market were obsoleted in less than a week when IBM announced the System/370-145 which had more memory and was lower priced than RCA had anticipated.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc180&quot; href=&quot;#fn180&quot;&gt;180&lt;/a&gt; The System/370-145 was the first commercial computer to ship with not only semiconductor memory, but with virtual memory, which greatly expanded the effective memory the computer had.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc181&quot; href=&quot;#fn181&quot;&gt;181&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undaunted, in March 1971, at the annual meeting, Robert Sarnoff, RCA’s Chairman, told shareholders : “Our highest priorities today are the establishment of a profitable computer business and capture of the domestic industry’s No. 2 position. RCA has made a greater investment in this effort than in any prior venture in its history, and we are convinced that the returns will be substantial.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc182&quot; href=&quot;#fn182&quot;&gt;182&lt;/a&gt; RCA’s computer revenues had grown from $14 million in 1960 to $257 million in 1970; although sales growth in 1970 was less than 10% with a reported loss of $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abruptly, on November 19, 1971, RCA, without any counsel from those in its computer division, threw in the towel. Univac would buy its customer base of roughly 1,000 machines and 500 customers for $70 million and the potential of another $30-60 million over the next five years, depending on future revenues.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc183&quot; href=&quot;#fn183&quot;&gt;183&lt;/a&gt; It made little difference to the competitive dynamics of the market-structure for IBM was solidly in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1970’s, the mainframe computer market-structure was seen as in turmoil, but in fact had become an oligopoly of one – IBM. The two potential alternatives, timesharing or a better mainframe, proved false hope. Timesharing could never overcome the overhead of communication costs – once terminals were over one hundred miles from the computer, telephone line charges made timesharing unprofitable.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc184&quot; href=&quot;#fn184&quot;&gt;184&lt;/a&gt; And as for a better mainframe, by the time competitors realized they had to do one better than the System/360, roughly 1969, IBM had an eight year advantage and an insurmountable lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While corporate computing had come to mean an IBM mainframe computer and a MIS department, a computer no longer meant a mainframe. Due in part to the stock market frenzy of 1967-1968, and the purchase of a start-up computer company, Scientific Data Systems, by Xerox Corporation for $900 million, or nine times revenues, ninety-one new companies introduced minicomputers between 1968 and 1972. Their story is next.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Worldwide revenues of minicomputers would total $2.5 billion in 1977, up from$835 million in 1973, projected International Data Corporation, a leading market research firm in 1974. “Nearly all ten major firms are profitable and, although price-cutting will continue, component costs will drop, enabling most to maintain their 20% before-tax profit margins.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc185&quot; href=&quot;#fn185&quot;&gt;185&lt;/a&gt; This stands in sharp contrast to mainframe computers, which had just one consistently profitable firm, IBM, and only five other firms offering token competition. IBM so disregarded minicomputers it would not be until 1976 before they introduced one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as IBM dominated mainframe computers, so would Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) come to dominate minicomputers – despite ninety-two companies introducing minicomputers between 1968 and 1972. By the early 1980’s, DEC would challenge IBM for market leadership before the two of them became prey to the personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genesis of DEC returns us to the very same MIT Lincoln Labs responsible for the SAGE project (1950-1952). One of the 400 engineers hired to staff SAGE was Kenneth H. Olsen, then a graduate student studying for his masters degree in engineering at MIT. Olsen quickly excelled, displaying both initiative and leadership. When a team leader was needed to build a computer to test Forrester’s core memory, Olsen was chosen. Told he had nine months – Forrester didn’t believe it could be done in a year – Olsen’s team of fifteen engineers delivered the Memory Test Computer, or MTC, within nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olsen thrived within the culture of Lincoln Labs that encouraged and rewarded creativity and competence. Lincoln Labs’ very nature was to take technology risks – calculated ones – but ones leading to radical, not just incremental, innovations. Pushing the envelope, as it would later be called, the unique relationship that existed between Lincoln Labs and MIT’s engineering graduate programs energized both as they strove to better understand the information technologies and their use. The implications will be present through out this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 1953, Olsen was thrust into an experience of a very different kind: one he would never forget, and one that deeply influenced the way he managed DEC into the success it was. Forrester needed a liason to IBM, someone to be in daily contact, to make sure the relationship between Lincoln Labs and IBM went smoothly. He selected Olsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was the antithesis of Lincoln Labs. In 1952, IBM knew little about building vacuum tube computers. The principal reason IBM sought the SAGE project was to educate itself on how to build and manufacture computers. Little wonder IBM forced so many meetings, and there were so many levels of management involved in the most simple decisions. IBM was hiring hundreds of new employees, thousands including those in manufacturing, while undertaking the most complicated and complex project in its company history. IBM behaved so as not to fail – the exact opposite of the aggressively experimental culture of Lincoln Labs. “It was like going to a communist state,” Olsen remembers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc186&quot; href=&quot;#fn186&quot;&gt;186&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Olsen’s thirteen months in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Norman Taylor, his boss, spent weeks at a time working with him. In their many off-hours together, Taylor suffered much of Olsen’s unhappiness. He tried to console him, but with little success. In late 1953, Talyor remembers a frustrated Olsen telling him: “Norm, I can beat these guys at their own game.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc187&quot; href=&quot;#fn187&quot;&gt;187&lt;/a&gt; If IBM could succeed with their bureaucratic organization, just think how one with the freedoms and openness of Lincoln Labs would fare. Olsen’s belief and confidence in people seemed almost threatened – he began thinking more as a leader, an entrepreneur, than as simply an engineer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc188&quot; href=&quot;#fn188&quot;&gt;188&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On returning to Lincoln Labs, Olsen assumed responsibility for a sub-group in advanced engineering. Soon he and Wes Clark proposed building an advanced computer using vacuum tubes. The idea was rejected – any advanced design should be made with transistors – this was Lincoln Labs not IBM. Had conservatism rubbed off? Olsen and his team immediately began developing transistor circuits to learn as much as they could. Soon they proposed building a computer with roughly the same architecture, but using transistors. Their plan approved, they set out to create what would become the TX-2 computer&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc189&quot; href=&quot;#fn189&quot;&gt;189&lt;/a&gt; – to many the first personal computer and the beginning of a new computer trajectory.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc190&quot; href=&quot;#fn190&quot;&gt;190&lt;/a&gt; (That meant that all three computer trajectories began in the same laboratory at the same time. The TX-2 computer led directly to the LINC computers and the trajectory of personal computers, while the circuitry of the TX-2 was used in the PDP-1 computer, influencing the first minicomputer, the PDP-8 in 1965, and therefore the minicomputer trajectory. Concurrently, the SAGE computer was being designed and built which led to the IBM 704 and eventually to the System/360 – the mainframe computer trajectory.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1957, Olsen felt ready to start a computer company. In August, Olsen, 31 years old, and Harlan Anderson, 28 years old, a friend and team member from Lincoln Labs, formed DEC with a $70,000 investment from the venture capital firm, American Research &amp;amp; Development (ARD). Post financing, ARD owned 70% of DEC, Olsen 12% and Andersen 8%. The balance, or 10%, was reserved to recruit a third partner, one talented in business management and marketing. (One never was hired.) DEC’s market value was therefore $100,000. General Georges Doriot, the legendary venture capitalist who helped found 150 companies, counseled the two aspiring entrepreneurs before their presentation to ARD’s Board of Directors: “First, don’t use the word computer. Fortunemagazine says giants like RCA and General Electric are losing money in computers. The board will never believe two young engineers, barely off campus, can succeed where others more experienced are failing.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc191&quot; href=&quot;#fn191&quot;&gt;191&lt;/a&gt; They followed his advice and described the machines they wanted to build as printed circuit modules, not computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they had started DEC to build computers. So in order to stay below the radar, to remain undetected, not to provoke reaction from existing computer firms, they named their first computer, the Programmed Data Processor, or PDP-1.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc192&quot; href=&quot;#fn192&quot;&gt;192&lt;/a&gt; Introduced in 1959, the PDP-1 was an 18-bit system, like the TX-2, and sold for $120,000. It could be used as front-end personal computers to the large scientific computers like STRETCH and LARC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc193&quot; href=&quot;#fn193&quot;&gt;193&lt;/a&gt; Important circuits of the PDP-1 were the same as the TX-2. This could have become a problem, appropriating Government intellectual property without compensation, but Tayor intervened, advising MIT to do nothing. “If the guy wants to borrow this circuitry, what the hell?” Taylor argued.”He designed half of it.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc194&quot; href=&quot;#fn194&quot;&gt;194&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inter-relationship of DEC and MIT, especially MIT Lincoln Labs, was profound. In many respects, there existed little difference between them. To the engineers, working at DEC was essentially the same as working at the Labs, except for compensation, opportunity and, hopefully, job security. They all feared the expected day when Government R &amp;amp; D funding would dry up – and always for reasons they had little power to influence. DEC and Lincoln Labs shared much the same culture and missions because of people – with no one more important to DEC than C. Gordon Bell. Bell started working at DEC in June 1960. Well into the 1980’s, he was involved in designing all of DEC’s most important computers and crafted the DEC strategy that unseated IBM’s control of corporate computing. After Olsen, Bell looms largest in the success and history of DEC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc195&quot; href=&quot;#fn195&quot;&gt;195&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEC’s efforts to become a computer company seemed headed for failure until in 1962, International Telephone and Telegraph ordered fifteen PDP-1s to use in one of their telephone switching systems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc196&quot; href=&quot;#fn196&quot;&gt;196&lt;/a&gt; This made ITT an OEM, the only customer type the first minicomputer companies had as they struggled for sales. Original equipment manufacturers – OEMs – embedded computers into their products – medical equipment, scientific instrumentation, or process control equipment – before selling the combination as finished product to end users. The computer had to be fast, that is it had to be real-time, dedicated in most cases to only one function and inexpensive. Small surprise the mainframe computer companies showed little interest. Minicomputers seemed truly a different business, as had computers to the manufacturers of tabulating equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But minicomputer firms wanted to be more than simply OEM suppliers. They dreamed of selling their computers to large end user organizations – those wanting to extend the benefits of computerization throughout their organizations – or to organizations too small to justify a mainframe. To large corporations, the costs of minicomputers could often be justified solely from the savings in telecommunications costs. And as for the cost advantages of minicomputers over mainframe computers: in 1968, Hewlett-Packard Co. introduced a minicomputer that supported time-sharing for up to sixteen users for $89,500. The cheapest timesharing system sold by GE at the time was $527,000, six times as much.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc197&quot; href=&quot;#fn197&quot;&gt;197&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEC also eyed timesharing. After designing four more computers, only two of which were introduced, in 1964, DEC announced the PDP-6 – carrying a price tag of $300,000. Despite early optimism, only twenty-three of them were ever sold – making it DEC’s worse selling computer ever. Even more worrisome, DEC’s revenues were up only 10% to $11 million in 1964. Profits, premised on higher sales, dropped from $1.2 million to $900,000. Olsen knew something needed fixing but what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olsen increasingly suspected the existing hierarchical organizational structure combined with an engineering dominated culture as the causes of DEC’s problems. There were always ways a product could be improved, or new features added, or excuses of too little time available as engineers labored to fix something old (especially old as already in production). The very organizational culture and structure engineers found so attractive, confused orderly, profitable operations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc198&quot; href=&quot;#fn198&quot;&gt;198&lt;/a&gt; He needed to change the culture and structure – to invent a new DEC management style – one conducive to success, not impeding progress as now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olsen sought counsel from his two most influential advisors, Forrester, now a Board member, and Doriot, his investor. He received conflicting advice. Then it came to him – assign one executive responsibility for each product line. Each would act as an entrepreneur, with full profit and loss responsibility. They would shepherd product from development through profitable operations. It would become known as a “matrix” organization and is credited for much of DEC’s success.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc199&quot; href=&quot;#fn199&quot;&gt;199&lt;/a&gt; The enthusiasm, creativity and productivity that had marked DEC’s earliest days, and lighted Olsen’s vision, came to life. The effect was immediate and pronounced. Within two years DEC went public with a market capitalization of $77 million – 770 times its founding valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engine propelling DEC’s sales and profit growth during this period, the PDP-8, was introduced in the fall of 1965. It, more than any other computer, is considered the first true minicomputer. It had a 12-bit architecture and was designed by Bell and implemented by Edson deCastro. It sold for $18,000 and could fit on a desktop or laboratory bench. No one anticipated selling anywhere near the 50,000 they did. It proved a market for computers other than mainframe computers really existed and contributed to the explosion of minicomputer entrants beginning in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, mainframe computer companies gave DEC and minicomputers hardly a look. They were locked into battle for survival with IBM and its System/360. But why did IBM not innovate the minicomputer? It certainly wasn’t from a lack of resources – DEC funding was only $70,000. This phenomenon of existing firms innovating a technology that should have given them the awareness and understanding to see new instantiations of the technology – such as mainframe computer manufacturers seeing minicomputers and being first and best to market them – is so common, an explanation is appropriate. See Graph 1.2 - Technology Trajectories and Buying Demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-225-technology-trajectories-and-buying-demand&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.25 Technology Trajectories and Buying Demand&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-a-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.2 Technology Trajectories and Buying Demand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the 1965 perspective of a mainframe computer company, minicomputers were not even competition. Minicomputers were never encountered in selling situations, and mainframes rented for $20,000 a month. The PDP-8 cost $18,000. But advances in semiconductor technologies, Medium Scale Integration (MSI) to Large Scale Integration (LSI) to Very Scale Integration (VLSI)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc200&quot; href=&quot;#fn200&quot;&gt;200&lt;/a&gt; , and software and peripherals, such as Winchester Disk Drives, all allowed more computing resources to be sold as the DEC VAX-11/780 minicomputer in 1979 than existed in the IBM System/360 mainframe in 1965. And by 1988, personal computers represented an alternative to both mainframes and minicomputers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc201&quot; href=&quot;#fn201&quot;&gt;201&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, DEC knew it needed to begin designing their next generation minicomputer – the successor to the PDP-8. One decision had already been made for them, however. The architecture would be 16-bits, two 8-bit bytes. Even though DEC had never innovated a computer built on an 8-bit byte, the PDP-8 being a 12-bit computer, their new, PDP-X would be 16-bits. This standardization of technology had been dictated by IBM when they built the System/360 with an 8-bit byte. To co-join the learning curve advances that would accrue from IBM’s purchasing power, and the tide of innovation that would be attendent to it, meant converting to the 8-bit byte. (An excellent example of a relationship between market-structure and technological outcome.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDP-X would be the first computer since the PDP-1 to be designed by someone other than Bell, who in late 1966 had left DEC to teach at Carnegie-Mellon University. De Castro, promoted to design leader, presented the PDP-X design to management in late 1967. The recommendation echoed many of the same themes as had the presentation of IBM’s task force six years earlier, whose recommendations led to the System/360:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A series of compatible products to replace DEC’s incompatible products.Products representing 85 % of the minicomputer market.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A path of upgrade for customers to leverage their past investment.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Conversion to the newest semiconductor technology (MSI), and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shared use of all software and peripherals.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc202&quot; href=&quot;#fn202&quot;&gt;202&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product line managers, who under the new matrix organizational structure saw their roles being diminished, and senior management, who thought the concept too risky, rejected the PDP-X recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To de Castro, who harbored entrepreneurial desires, the decison to kill PDP-X gave him all the reason he needed to begin planning his new company. On April, 15, 1968, de Castro, Henry Burkhardt and Dick Sogge resigned from DEC to start Data General Corporation (DG). Their first product, the 16-bit Nova, was introduced in 1969. DG immediately became DEC’s most serious and emotionally-igniting competitor – many in DEC management, including Olsen, could never forgive de Castro and his team for leaving.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc203&quot; href=&quot;#fn203&quot;&gt;203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell writes later, from the distance of 1984: “DG had a simple-to-build, yet modern, 16-bit minicomputer based on integrated circuits that enabled it to be priced below all existing products despite its late entrance into the market. In fact, the late entry was a benefit, since more modern parts could be used and the experience of others could be taken into account. The simplicity of the DG product allowed rapid distribution, especially to OEMs.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc204&quot; href=&quot;#fn204&quot;&gt;204&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc205&quot; href=&quot;#fn205&quot;&gt;205&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of when product definition, final architecture and components, is fixed looms large because of the differing rates of innovation of all the technologies embedded in the product and on which it is dependent. An obvious component decision was when to lock-in the choice of memory. In semiconductor memory technology, however, the pace of change from one thousand bits (1K) of memory (1972) to one million bits (1M) of memory (1987) was phenomenal. Depending on which year a computer design was finalized determined which memory technology was used. Even a year later, memory with four times the capacity might become available. The following Graph 1.3 - Memory Trajectories is an effort to capture both the nature of discontinuous and of rapid change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-226-memory-trajectories206&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.26 Memory Trajectories&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc206&quot; href=&quot;#fn206&quot;&gt;206&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Exhibit-a-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit 2.2 Memory Trajectories&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the defection of the DG founders in April 1968, Olsen promoted Nick Mazzarese to lead the PDP-X effort. For another year and a half they struggled to complete a 16-bit design. By December 1969, Massarese desperate for help, arranged a meeting with Bell in Pittsburg. Along with roughly twelve other critical personnel, they presented the architecture and component technologies of PDP-X. When Bell and fellow professor, William Wulf, were asked their opinion, both agreed – they didn’t like it.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc207&quot; href=&quot;#fn207&quot;&gt;207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did they do? This dozen or so information technologists, under the architecural leadership of Bell, influenced by the intellectual work of one of his graduate students, Harold MacFarland, worked one very long weekend to design the PDP-11 – the most successful 16-bit computer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc208&quot; href=&quot;#fn208&quot;&gt;208&lt;/a&gt; The DEC engineers had now been working on this objective for more than two years.Bell remembers the PDP-11 as “just good enough to beat Data General’s Nova.”“&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc209&quot; href=&quot;#fn209&quot;&gt;209&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only weeks later, on January 5, 1970, DEC announced the PDP-11, knowing it was still just a design. Sales price: $10,800. Over 250,000 PDP-11s were sold to make it the most successful 16-bit minicomputer – and designed in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasserting technological leadership was critical to DEC, for between 1968 and 1972, ninety-two potential competitors entered the market. The most important were DG, HP, Prime, and finally IBM. A number of converging dynamics put the future up for grabs, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Integrated circuits:A rapidly changing technology trajectory from MSI (late 60’s) to LSI (mid-1970’s) to VLSI (early 1980’s). The levels of performance improvements – function up and costs down – were in orders of magnitude.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc210&quot; href=&quot;#fn210&quot;&gt;210&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Economics of timesharing - The prohibitive costs of using the telephone system drove the economics in favor of the rapidly improving minicomputer. “The intelligent little machines are just going to proliferate like mad,”said one executive.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc211&quot; href=&quot;#fn211&quot;&gt;211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Minicomputer technologies - Not just integrated circuit componentry was improving, so were storage, operating systems, database systems, communications, and more. A Datamation article in 1971 reads:”Minicomputer prices are expected to continue to drop in the next three to five years at a rate on the order of 20% per year as they have for the last five years.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc212&quot; href=&quot;#fn212&quot;&gt;212&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Capital Availability - The great surge in private investment beginning in 1967 created competition, both at the firm and product level. Competition forced more complete and thorough investigation of the solution space of possibilities extant – accelerating the search for the best design. But then the Tax Reform act of 1969 increased the capital gains tax rate from individuals from 25% to 35%, and within three years the effective rate was 49%, and the capital explosion of 67-68 was choked off.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Human Resources - In just four years, the number of minicomputer firms exceeded the number of Second Generation mainframe computers ninety-two to sixteen. Many firms could not have existed without a tremendous diffusion of knowledge and training of personnel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Rapid Growth of Buying Demand - Organizations were discovering, and adapting to, economic opportunities from the use of computers (discussed above as Management Information Systems).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Bell analyzed the success of the 1968 to 1972 minicomputer start-ups.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc213&quot; href=&quot;#fn213&quot;&gt;213&lt;/a&gt; The following table examines the correlation of a company’s origin to its status in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-227-minicomputer-entrants-1968-1983&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.27 Minicomputer Entrants 1968-1983&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

Non-computer companies building minicomputers for backward integration or special system niches: Again Bell.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc214&quot; href=&quot;#fn214&quot;&gt;214&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oligopoly in minicomputers consisted of four firms, or five percent of all entrants. (DEC, IBM, DG and Prime) Over sixty percent of entrants were start-ups. As of 1983, 53% of all entrants had failed and no longer existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minicomputers experienced three generations of product advance before the trajectory reached its sustaining level – 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit architectures. In each, a new firm introduced the first commercial success: DEC, DG and Prime respectively. DEC proved able to respond to the challenge of the new architectures, and in each had a dominant design – the PDP-11 and the story yet to be told of the VAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1976, minicomputers were no longer poor cousins to mainframe computers, but were a high growth market-structure in their own right. In 1976, minicomputers revenues totaled $1.8 billion, still dwarfed by the $10 billion of mainframe computers, but already equal to those of service bureaus at $1.9 billion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc215&quot; href=&quot;#fn215&quot;&gt;215&lt;/a&gt; Minicomputers and dedicated application computer systems (OEMs) represented seven out of every ten computers installed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc216&quot; href=&quot;#fn216&quot;&gt;216&lt;/a&gt; OEM’s remained important, at 40% of revenues and 66% of unit sales, but significantly less so than only a decade earlier when OEM’s accounted for virtually all minicomputer sales.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc217&quot; href=&quot;#fn217&quot;&gt;217&lt;/a&gt; The Government now represented less than 5% of all installed computers – down from over 90% in the mid-1950’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM introduced its first minicomputer, the Series 1, in 1976. IBM’s actions were not motivated by any threat of immediate competition for IBM had $7 billion in revenues, ten times those of either DEC&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc218&quot; href=&quot;#fn218&quot;&gt;218&lt;/a&gt; or its nearest mainframe competitor, Honeywell. But much as IBM once reacted when insurance companies signed contracts to buy UNIVACs, insurance companies and banks – two of IBM’s largest and best customer types – forced IBM’s actions when they began using minicomputers. (Industry statistics for 1976 show insurance and banking as the two most intensely computerized market-structures at 76% and71%.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc219&quot; href=&quot;#fn219&quot;&gt;219&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, DEC, once again played catch up, only this time it was to ship a 32-bit computer. Despite holding a 40% market share, DEC now lagged Prime Computer, the first to introduce a commercially successful 32-bit minicomputer, by four years. And everyone believed, correctly, that future growth in minicomputers would be in 32-bit architectures, just as it once had been in 8-bit and 16-bit architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell, back at DEC since 1975 as vice president of engineering, had a vision larger than just introducing the best 32-bit minicomputer. He wanted to radically reshape DEC’s entire product line. And much like IBM’s System/360 or de Castro’s PDP-X strategies, his goal was one computer architecture to span the entire range of customer requirements. In the spring of 1975, Bell proposed building the VAX-11&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc220&quot; href=&quot;#fn220&quot;&gt;220&lt;/a&gt; (Virtual Address Extension. The 11 paid homage to the PDP-11 and was an effort to make it seem all one big happy family of computers. Virtual addressing was introduced commercially in IBM’s System/370-145, in September 1970 – and, for all practical purposes, knocked RCA out of the computer business.) In June 1975, Bell reorganized engineering from one central R &amp;amp; D group and engineering groups for each product line into one department totally focused on developing the VAX.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc221&quot; href=&quot;#fn221&quot;&gt;221&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1977, DEC introduced the VAX-11/780 – described as a 32-bit “superminicomputer.” It had taken two and one-half years to develop, and although six years after Prime had introduced their 32-bit computer, the VAX-11/780 incorporated the latest in semiconductor logic and memory and supported virtual memory. DEC quickly seized market leadership.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc222&quot; href=&quot;#fn222&quot;&gt;222&lt;/a&gt; Good, but not yet done. Bell’s vision meant ceasing new development on all product architectures other than VAX. Bell believed the ability of computers to communicate at high-speed with each other was going to revolutionize how computers were designed and functioned. Having only one architecture made networking them together significantly easier which would give DEC the competitive advantage in networking to overtake IBM.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc223&quot; href=&quot;#fn223&quot;&gt;223&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others saw the transformational changes coming in computers as well. In 1977, at one of the largest computer trade shows, the National Computer Conference in Dallas, Mark Shepard, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Texas Instruments Inc., delivered the keynote address. He too saw a revolution in progress, but the one he spoke of was the impact of the computer on society and the future:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The remarkable fact is that in computing technology…we stand today about the midpoint of a 12 order-of-magnitude change in the nature of the computing world.There is no way we can envision what this kind of change really means. When major, step-function advances are achieved, their potential usually is realized in successive stages. First, we do better the things we already were doing. Next, we do new things. Finally, the advances pervade and change our entire life style and become an essential, built-in part of our society. The computer revolution is just reaching the threshold of this third stage.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc224&quot; href=&quot;#fn224&quot;&gt;224&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shepard goes on to add: “The U.S. is clearly ahead in the fundamental technologies which permit the distribution of computing power to the point of use. And with this capability, we can lead an intellectual revolution which will have greater impact on living standards than that of the industrial revolution.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc225&quot; href=&quot;#fn225&quot;&gt;225&lt;/a&gt; Twenty years later, Shepard’s seemingly audacious prediction would become accepted fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the Fall 1978, Bell was ready to advance his vision to upper management. He saw three-tiers of computers – mainframes, minicomputers and personal computers. New computer communications technologies – networking – would make them all work as one. The individual would seamlessly move among the company’s computers and might someday move among computers all around the globe – the “Intergalactic Network” as put forth by Dr. Licklider in the early 1960’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell argued for a change in DEC corporate strategy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The essence of the strategy is simplicity through adopting a single architecture. Although superficially it appears to be possible to have numerous architectures that are segmented by size and by market, the user requirements to cross both size and application boundaries are significant. In fact, given that IBM is segmenting its products both by size and application, the main strength of the strategy is to have a single architecture with which a user can be comfortable rather than bounded by a manufacturer segmentation. The most compelling reason for basing the strategy on the single VAX architecture, besides the technical excellence of the product, is the belief that we cannot build the truly distributed computing system of the ’80s with heterogeneous architectures.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc226&quot; href=&quot;#fn226&quot;&gt;226&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1978, the DEC Board of Directors endorsed the VAX strategy, and with it, Bell’s vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History will prove Bell both right, and yet not radical enough, in large measure because of the third technological discontinuity – the microprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;On November 5, 1971, Intel Corporation, a three-year-old start-up, announced the world’s first “micro-programmable computer on a chip” – the 4004 microprocessor. Claiming it would usher in “a new era of integrated electronics,” it was advertising hyperbole as master understatement. No one had any idea of the revolutionary potential of the microprocessor. But how could one? Something as small as the first three letters of the word ENIAC, yet equal in computational power to that thirty ton first computer. Intel management even debated whether to introduce the 4004 for uncertainty of market (in a year in which the installed base of computers totaled 88,000). Only eight years later, in 1979, 75 million microprocessors would be sold&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc227&quot; href=&quot;#fn227&quot;&gt;227&lt;/a&gt; – 329,000 as microcomputers&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc228&quot; href=&quot;#fn228&quot;&gt;228&lt;/a&gt; – four times the number of minicomputers (81,300) and forty five times the number of mainframe computers (7,300).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc229&quot; href=&quot;#fn229&quot;&gt;229&lt;/a&gt; In time, neither IBM nor DEC could withstand the technological discontinuity it both caused and represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early microprocessors were not really computers on a chip, but only the central processing units, or CPUs – the CPU being where the programming instructions and data are brought together to be executed. For these microprocessors to qualify as a computer, additional chips were needed. In the case of the 4004, three other chips, two of them memory chips, one for data transfer and one for instruction transfer. Then the 4004 became the MCS-4, microcomputer system, also introduced on November 15. Microprocessors found home either as microcomputer systems or as embedded intelligence in OEM products – just like minicomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microprocessors started a new technology trajectory – the 4004 representing product instantiation. Before microprocessors could exist, advances in a number of enabling technologies were needed, including: semiconductor manufacturing, software and computer design. The 4004 required fabricating 2,250 circuit components on one chip that required Large Scale Integration (LSI), just happening in the early 1970’s. LSI made possible chip densities of up to 10,000 components whereas the previous generation – Medium Scale Integration – enabled only 1,000 components per chip. Software advances were needed to implement logic in software, not hardware i.e. transistors. And advances in computer design were needed to understand how to reduce a computer’s architecture to the essential – a path of development encompassing all computer design since the ENIAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovation of the microprocessor was motivated by an explosion in the number of integrated circuit chips, much as the integrated circuit was motivated by the impossibility of wiring thousands of transistors together. Beginning in roughly 1965, creating a computer meant selecting an architecture and then implementing the architecture in logical units with integrated circuits. Since there were an unlimited number of computer architectures and logic units, the number of different integrated circuits exploded. But as the number of unique integrated circuits grew, the volume of any given one went down, which drove manufacturing economics not towards high volume, low cost chips but to the opposite – expensive chips.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc230&quot; href=&quot;#fn230&quot;&gt;230&lt;/a&gt; And as in the early days of integrated circuits, buying demand growth required low costs, made possible by high volumes, which were driven by large buying demand – another catch-22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different solutions were proposed by almost every manufacturer. The most promising combined standardization of integrated circuit chips with sophisticated design software. Not surprisingly, firms manufacturing integrated circuits favored this solution. But this approach did not promise simpler designs, and less chips, unless everyone adopted the same design, an unlikely outcome in a competitive world. This was exactly the case in calculators. Integrated circuits revolutionized calculators from electro-mechanical monsters barely able to be carried around to hand-held units powered with batteries. In 1968, any calculator company wanting to remain competitive had to use integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth pausing for a moment. 1968 will emerge as a very important year. It marks, for example, the beginning of the larger history being told of computer communications. One of the events making 1968 special was the founding of Intel Corporation. The founders of Intel saw an opportunity to innovate semiconductor memories, which it did. Intel then innovated the microprocessor. Radically innovating two technologies makes Intel very special – few firms radically innovate more than once. It also just happens that the two innovations, along with software, are essential to information technology products. A continuing subject in future chapters will be the competitive dynamics of the semiconductor market-structure and their influence on the emerging dynamics of computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Robert N. Noyce and Gordon E. Moore resigned from Fairchild Semiconductor, a company they helped found, to start Intel Corporation. They left Fairchild, then a $150 million company,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc231&quot; href=&quot;#fn231&quot;&gt;231&lt;/a&gt; because they felt bogged down in the bureaucracy of a large company – Noyce was managing 15,000 employees&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc232&quot; href=&quot;#fn232&quot;&gt;232&lt;/a&gt; – and because they wanted to participate more directly in innovating semiconductor technologies. They targeted semiconductor memories – believing both buying demand existed for semiconductor memory instead of core memory and memory design would be the first to benefit from the coming semiconductor process advances to LSI. In short, they saw an economic opportunity. They then easily raised $2.5 million and were on their way. When vision is combined with the experience and the drive to make it happen, the will to act, the entrepreneur is born – or, as in this case, born again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the end of the year, Intel announced a one thousand bit (1K), random access memory (RAM) chip named the 1103 – or 1103 1K RAM.Although not the first 1K RAM introduced, the 1103 would soon dominate. Its success was due to a number of factors, including: the competence and creativity of the personnel of Intel, the quality of the design, second sourcing, and manufacturing prowess.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc233&quot; href=&quot;#fn233&quot;&gt;233&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1969, Busicom, a now defunct Japanese calculator company, needed a source of integrated circuits with which to build calculators before their existing electro-mechanical models became obsolete. (To the calculator market-structure, the integrated circuit represented a technological discontinuity just as it did to computers.) Busicom contacted Intel. They wanted twelve different chips designed and manufactured. Assigned to lead the project was Marcian E. “Ted” Hoff, Jr., a recent graduate of Stanford and Intel’s twelfth employee. He assessed the design as too complicated, requiring chips of 3000-5000 transistors, and beyond Intel’s manufacturing capabilities.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc234&quot; href=&quot;#fn234&quot;&gt;234&lt;/a&gt; There the story might have ended were it not for the persistence and creativity of Hoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hoff struggled with the design constraints of an architecture simple enough to be manufactured, yet complex enough to meet Busicom’s requirements, he reflected on the architecture of the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer he was using. The PDP-8 had a very limited set of instructions, but because it had lots of memory complicated control and logic operations were possible. If he could reproduce that design, a few instructions with sufficient memory, maybe the design would both satisfy Busicom and be general enough to meet other design objectives. To Hoff, the fact that Busicom had exclusive rights to the design, had no affect on his search for an optimum solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noyce and Moore, fully knowledgeable of the catch-22 confronting integrated circuitry, liked Hoff’s idea and authorized him to proceed. At the same time, manufacturing within Intel perfected a new process to create reliable chips of 2000 transistors.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc235&quot; href=&quot;#fn235&quot;&gt;235&lt;/a&gt; As Hoff pressed forward, knowing he had to limit the design to roughly two thousand transistors per chip, the Busicom design team continued down the original path. In the late fall, the two designs were presented to Busicom executives who selected Hoff’s design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the challenge of reducing the architectural design to silicon – working chips. Little progress was made until Federico Faggin came aboard from Fairchild in the spring of 1970. In less than nine month’s, samples of the four chips of the MCS-4 were working. But competitive conditions in calculators had driven end user prices to unexpectedly low levels, and Busicom had no choice but to renegotiate the contract with Intel in order to buy the chips at significantly lower prices. In renegotiating the contract, Intel regained rights to sell the chips to others for non-calculator applications.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc236&quot; href=&quot;#fn236&quot;&gt;236&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the rights did not mean they would be exercised – especially when many members of management and the Board of Directors were uncertain if enough buying demand existed to warrant the investment of organizational and financial resources to launch and support the product. Ed Gelbach, having recently joined Intel from Texas Instruments as senior vice president responsible for marketing, argued new applications were the issue – not the two thousand units calculated assuming a ten percent share of the minicomputer market. His and Arthur Rock’s, the Chairman of the Board’s, arguments proved crucial. Intel introduced the first microprocessor and microcomputer system on November 15, 1971. By February 1972, an encouraging $85,000 of MCS-4 chip sets had been sold.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc237&quot; href=&quot;#fn237&quot;&gt;237&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this same period, Intel also had under development an 8-bit microprocessor. In late 1969, Computer Terminals Corporation (CTC), later to be renamed Datapoint Corporation, approached Intel to design and manufacture a LSI chip for a new intelligent CRT terminal.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc238&quot; href=&quot;#fn238&quot;&gt;238&lt;/a&gt; Intel proposed a one chip design. CTC also solicited a proposal from TI. In March 1971, TI demonstrated their chip to CTC. Neither the Intel nor TI chips were used; CTC felt pressed to bring their terminal to market before production quantities of either chip would be ready. (TI was awarded a patent in 1978 for their design – proving the essential circuitry of a microcomputer could fit on one chip.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc239&quot; href=&quot;#fn239&quot;&gt;239&lt;/a&gt; ) Intel continued their development program and in April 1972 introduced the first 8-bit microprocessor – the 8008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge confronting Intel now switched from development to supporting companies and engineers intrigued with using microprocessors, but having no experience or training in their use. Beginning in 1972, Intel launched a steady stream of software and hardware products to aid those developing applications for their microprocessors. Even that was not enough. In 1973, to both sell and support the idea of substituting microprocessors for hardware logic, Intel began a promotion campaign directed to explaining the advantages of microprocessors and inviting engineers to attend seminars and customer training programs.(Engineering programs at leading universities began to offer courses on microprocessors and microcomputers during this period.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel may have led the way but by July 1974 they were far from alone. A total of nineteen microprocessors were available or announced.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc240&quot; href=&quot;#fn240&quot;&gt;240&lt;/a&gt; Early entrants following Intel were: Rockwell, Fairchild, National Semiconductor, Signetics, Toshiba, AMI, Teledyne Systems, and, of course, TI. By mid-1975, forty microprocessors existed and by 1976, the number had grown to fifty-four. The microprocessor trajectory had clearly entered the competitive stage. As Noyce and Hoff write of these years in 1981: “It was clearly a time of wide-ranging experimentation in architectures, processes, and packaging.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc241&quot; href=&quot;#fn241&quot;&gt;241&lt;/a&gt; These years, 1973-74, also saw manufacturers first unable to keep up with demand, and then having to adjust to a mini-recession in 1974-1975. Nevertheless, the acceptance of microprocessors continued to grow. DEC would introduce a series of microprocessor modules using Intel 8008’s in March 1974. Revenues of microprocessors totaled $37.7 million in 1974; a year in which the installed base of microprocessors exceeded both those of minicomputers and mainframe computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc242&quot; href=&quot;#fn242&quot;&gt;242&lt;/a&gt; Projections of revenues were $50 million in 1975, $150 million in 1976 and $450 million by 1980.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc243&quot; href=&quot;#fn243&quot;&gt;243&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1974, Intel announced the first second generation 8-bit microprocessor – the 8080. Development of the 8080 was not intentional, or at least it did not start out that way. Rather it began as an effort to ascertain if recently advanced fabrication technologies used in memory production would improve the performance of the 8008.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc244&quot; href=&quot;#fn244&quot;&gt;244&lt;/a&gt; But it quickly became obvious to do so required significant layout changes of the 8008. Aware the chip had serious design flaws, the decision was then made to re-design the chip with an objective of improving its performance by a factor of ten.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc245&quot; href=&quot;#fn245&quot;&gt;245&lt;/a&gt; Even before 8080 fabrication began, Intel management knew they had a winner, and for the first time pre-announced a product. Its immediate acceptance proved the demand for a high-performance 8-bit microprocessor was larger than anyone had expected. Two chips threatened market leadership of the 8080– the Motorola 6800 and the Zilog Z-80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Motorola 6800, introduced in mid-1974, proved important for at least two reasons. First, it began a line of chip development that would become Intel’s most serious competitor, although no one knew it at the time. (This fact notwithstanding, the Motorola chip family will occupy only small mention in this work for they found their welcome home not in the office market but in the technical-scientific market, and had little direct impact on the course of computer communications.) Second, the 6800 began the practice of introducing microprocessor development tools and microprocessor supporting chips simultaneously, not over time as was then the case.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc246&quot; href=&quot;#fn246&quot;&gt;246&lt;/a&gt; This change significantly raised the costs of market entry and peaked product development investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the Zilog Z-80 was not introduced until 1976, it nearly changed the history of microprocessors. The story begins in 1972 when Intel hired Ralph Ungermann, the same who will come to found Ungermann-Bass. Intel needed someone to plot their entry into the market for voice communications chips, and Ungermann, who had worked for both Collins Radio and Western Digital,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc247&quot; href=&quot;#fn247&quot;&gt;247&lt;/a&gt; wanted a job, almost any job, as long as it was with Intel – he even agreed to compensation less than he had been making. Once aboard, Ungermann soon convinced management to give him responsibility for microprocessor development systems – one working closely with Faggin. In 1974, needing money, Ungermann exercised some of his stock options before leaving for a July 4th vacation, only to find on his return that Intel’s stock price had dropped significantly below the price he had paid to exercise his options. With the interest expense on the loan incurred to pay for the stock now higher than his salary, Ungermann had no choice but to leave Intel in search of a better paying job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ungermann’s first impulse was to join the logic simulations software company he had helped start some years earlier – turning it into a success would certainly help his finances. But within days Faggin contacted Ungermann to tell him he had also left Intel. Would he be interested in doing something together? Almost before they could get together they received a call from Exxon Enterprises, a new division within Exxon, the largest corporation in the world. Learning of their departure from Intel in the weekly trade magazine, Electronic News, Exxon wanted them to start a semiconductor components company to support their intended office systems businesses. Ungermann remembers: “Exxon approached us and said: “Don’t you want to be in the semiconductor business?” We said:”No, we didn’t want to,” and Exxon fundamentally talked us into starting Zilog.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc248&quot; href=&quot;#fn248&quot;&gt;248&lt;/a&gt; Exxon would own half the company and the two founders one-fourth each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zilog’s initial strategy was to innovate an 8-bit microprocessor and some of the high-value peripheral chips needed to support the microprocessor – especially communications chips. Faggin took responsibility for the microprocessor and Ungermann the rest. Masatoshi Shima, the lead designer of the 8080 and contributor to the 8008 design, contacted Faggin and soon joined them. The decision of microprocessor architecture couldn’t have been more obvious, do a chip compatible with the 8080 – only better. Designing the chip and perfecting a third-part fabrication process took eighteen months. In 1976, Zilog announced the Z-80, an 8-bit microprocessor. The sales pitch: replace your 8080 with a higher performance chip without having to redo one line of software code. It proved compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by 1976, the next generation of microprocessors, those of 16-bit architectures, were already in the market. National Semiconductor was first, announcing their Pace chip in 1974. By 1976, TI (9900) and General Instruments (CP1600) had also entered the market.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc249&quot; href=&quot;#fn249&quot;&gt;249&lt;/a&gt; Intel, which began developing a 16-bit design in 1975, introduced their chip, the 8086, in late 1978. The 8086 exceeded the performance of the 8080 in every respect – for instance it could address one megabyte of memory not 64 K bytes – yet with 29,000 transistors required a chip die only 27 percent larger than the 8080.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc250&quot; href=&quot;#fn250&quot;&gt;250&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Z-80 began to out sell the 8080. Zilog seemed to have the momentum and it would come down to who had the best 16-bit chip – Intel or Zilog. But before Zilog could even introduce their product, internal organizational conflicts erupted. Ungermann and Faggin were at odds, it seemed one of them had to go. In December of 1978, the Zilog Board of Directors decided in favor of Faggin with the proviso that a new president be hired. On January 1, 1979, Manny Fernandez, then head of the Discrete Products Group at Fairchild, became President of Zilog. Soon thereafter, Zilog announced their 16-bit microprocessor – the Z-8000. Only the Z-8000 was not compatible with the Z-80, and although in many ways very competitive with the 8086, if customers had to re-write their software to up-grade to a 16-bit processor, their choice was simple – Intel over Zilog. Ungermann summarizes succinctly: “It killed the company. That was the fatal mistake – making the Z-8000 incompatible with the Z-80.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc251&quot; href=&quot;#fn251&quot;&gt;251&lt;/a&gt; No one was more surprised than the top management of Zilog who thought they had approved a Z-8000 design that was compatible with the Z-80. (Technically, Zilog did not die, in fact, years later it would become a publicly traded company. What the Z-8000 did kill was any chance to overtake Intel in microprocessors – an event that would have been improbable anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In achieving a dominant position with the 8086, Intel had truly institutionalized its microprocessor competence – it was an organizational competence not just that of select individuals. Intel had lost the two individuals who had led the design of their last two microprocessors – 8008 and 8080 – and even though those individuals collaborated to innovate the next generation competitive chip, Intel still produced the better chip. When organizations transition from being a collective to being more than the sum of its parts will be a re-occurring subject of interest in this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel had won the battle of 16-bit designs. In 1979, they introduced the 8088, an 8-bit processor with a 16-bit architecture – making it compatible with 8-bit 8080 software yet approaching the performance of a 16-bit processor. In a decision to be made in the next year by IBM, the 8088 would become the dominant design, and with it, so would the microprocessors of Intel. But before IBM announced the IBM Personal Computer, or PC, there remained one more vision of computing to be created: personal distributed computing. It is a story that began before microprocessors were ever conceived.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1979, few saw how microprocessors would penetrate corporate information systems. An exception were the computer scientists at Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) who had developed the Alto computer system. For Xerox, Alto proved to be of disappointingly little benefit – unlike the SAGE Project to IBM – but to the future world of computing it came to define distributed computing. In less than a decade, this new vision – personal distributed computing – made real in the Alto, propelled the innovation and economics of personal computers and their use. It was not a vision readily or willingly grasped by central MIS departments of large corporations, and by the time it was, control of how organizations informated&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc252&quot; href=&quot;#fn252&quot;&gt;252&lt;/a&gt; no longer was theirs to divine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vision plays an essential role in how computer technologies become instantiated. The need for fast calculators drove the first vision of computers. Then the vision became one of computers able to perform real-time computations. Driving this vision were the needs of the SAGE Project, funded by the Air Force. To those innovating SAGE, real-time wetted their appetite to interact directly with the computer, to be on-line, not to batch-process, the existing mode of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the mid to late 1950’s, computers were big and expensive. Cost prohibited their use. How to make interactive computing more accessible, available, and much more affordable became the design objectives. The vision became one computer supporting many simultaneous users – or timesharing. It was reduced to practice at MIT as Project MAC, again funded by the government, this time as ARPA. Timesharing, while designed with a big computer in mind, proved uneconomical for mainframes due to communications costs. Nevertheless, timesharing found a welcome home in minicomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xerox PARC came next. The individuals and the culture they created gave rise to the radical idea of giving every person a high-performance computer, architected as easy-to-use, and connected in a seamless manner to every other computer. How preposterous – in 1972, computers and software cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, computer-to-computer communications barely existed, and computers were anything but easy-to-use. The vision of personal distributed computing changed the assumption from fast computers and slow users to precisely the opposite, and in so doing, unleashed a torrent of innovation to forever change the nature of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1969, Peter McColough, President of Xerox, convinced that Xerox needed to acquire an existing computer company, made an appointment to see Max Palevsky, founder and Chairman of Scientific Data Systems (SDS). McColough’s convictions were neither new nor surprising. As early as 1965, McColough and Xerox Chairman Joe Wilson had approached several computer companies, including SDS and Digital Equipment Corporation, to sell them on the advantages of becoming part of Xerox – but to no avail. Their motivation was rooted in the fear of coming competition from IBM in copiers and of the looming importance of digital technologies in the future, technologies then foreign to them. To be a contender in the just emerging and potentially gigantic market referred to as the “office of the future,” Xerox, they believed, had to sell computers. As McColough prepared to call on Palevsky, he had good reason to believe this might be Xerox’s best, and maybe last, chance to acquire a computer company – and his own chance to earn a reputation as a leader as bold as Wilson.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc253&quot; href=&quot;#fn253&quot;&gt;253&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McColough wasted no time. He told Palevsky that Xerox would pay $900 million in Xerox stock for SDS – nine times SDS’s 1968 revenues of $100 million. To Palevsky, who was seeking to scale back his commitment to SDS, McColough’s words must have seemedlike a dream come true. The deal was done in two weeks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc254&quot; href=&quot;#fn254&quot;&gt;254&lt;/a&gt; Xerox had now entered the computer business to the surprise of top technical personnel within Xerox and to Wall Street analysts– who could hardly believe the purchase price. McColough immediately challenged SDS to aggressively target expansion into commercial markets,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc255&quot; href=&quot;#fn255&quot;&gt;255&lt;/a&gt; neither fearing IBM nor deterred by the mismatch of SDS’s existing products with the needs of the market nor with the struggle of IBM’s current competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On hearing of the acquisition, Jack Goldman, chief technologist for Xerox, recommended Xerox create a research center for information technologies. With a history of successfully leveraging research innovations – namely xerography – McColough quickly agreed and directed Goldman to find the person to head the effort. By early 1970, Goldman recruited an old friend and physicist, George Pake, with the charge to build a research center equal to AT&amp;amp;T’s Bell Labs. SDS executives objected, arguing the money would be better used to build products they could sell, but they were rebuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a March 1970 speech before the New York Society of Security Analysts, McColough, now CEO, waxed loftily : “The basic purpose of Xerox Corporation is to find the best means to bring greater order and discipline to information. Thus our fundamental thrust, our common denominator, has evolved toward establishing leadership in what we call ‘the architecture of information.’“&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc256&quot; href=&quot;#fn256&quot;&gt;256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening a facility in Palo Alto, California, in June, Pake began the critical process of recruiting staff. To educate himself on computer science and to find the needed people, Pake arranged a tour of many of the best university programs. He quickly learned that the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the Defense Department had the reputation of funding the most advanced computer research and supporting many of the best researchers. Pake arranged a visit for Bob Taylor, who was now at the University of Utah but had directed the IPTO office of ARPA from 1965 to 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pake viewed Taylor as strictly a consultant. He did not qualify as a candidate to head the Computer Science Laboratory because he had never conducted research himself – and to Pake, if one had not done research, one could not manage a research organization. On meeting, Pake explained the mission of CSL: supporting the long-term needs of SDS. Taylor expressed critical reservations. Based on personal experience with SDS, Taylor knew SDS did not have a vision of computing emphasizing timesharing and interactivity. When asked what PARC should do instead, Taylor stressed innovation to support of Xerox’s transition from a “copier company to being in office automation systems.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc257&quot; href=&quot;#fn257&quot;&gt;257&lt;/a&gt; Pake realized Taylor held a bold vision of computing – one more resonant with McColough’s architecture of information mission – and he knew who to recruit to bring it into being. Pake offered Taylor a job, and although not the one Taylor wanted, Taylor quickly carved out the role he sought – leading PARC’s computer research in creation of computing after timesharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor then recruited some of the absolutely best computer scientists. Their names are legendary: Alan Kay, Butler Lampson, Chuck Thacker, and others. They became recognized as the best computer research laboratory anywhere. (Ironically, some of the researchers before joining Xerox were funded by ARPA to write a timesharing system for a SDS computer that became the SDS 940. Even so, no productive exchange ever developed between CSL and SDS.) With staffing well underway, a set of research objective(s) were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor argued – before relenting – that the model, or metaphor, of timesharing was passÃ©. He saw a future when everyone would have their own high-performance computer, rather than sharing one lumbering behemoth. While others agreed, exactly how to go about implementing such a vision remained very much in question. Knowing they would need tools, including a computing environment, they resolved to focus on creating the infrastructure that would be needed while refining their thoughts on the future system. A timesharing system would be written, and not on a SDS computer, but on a copy of a DEC computer which had a timesharing operating system underwritten by ARPA. By mid 1972, MAXC and other tools were ready, and it was time to take on the larger challenge – one to become known as personal distributed computing – an idea J.C.R. Licklider originated now pursued by his friend and colleague Taylor. Taylor had now surrounded himself with others who believed as he did, especially Kay and his reactive engine – in honor of Babbage and his analytical engine – and best known as Dynabook.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc258&quot; href=&quot;#fn258&quot;&gt;258&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To premise an architecture of office information systems on every person having their own computer was a radical idea. First of all, what would anyone do with their own computer? At the time, computer output was a string of text or numbers, an answer if you will. But the PARC scientists believed the expression coined by Engelbart at Stanford Research Institute in the mid-1960’s, augmenting man’s intellect,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc259&quot; href=&quot;#fn259&quot;&gt;259&lt;/a&gt; better captured the power and usefulness of computers than did the prevailing notion of essentially a very fast calculator. To augment meant to present and accept data in the form best suited to humans, not computers. Humans can process graphical information unbelievably fast, yet computers did not support graphical interfaces. The same is true of communications – people can communicate millions, even billions, of bits per second visually, yet at the time computer communications delivered maximally ten thousand bits per second. If the computer was designed to support people, the computational requirements skyrocketed, which begged the second problem. How could everyone afford their own computer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costs of a single computer in 1972, a minicomputer not mainframe, could total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars – clearly not a viable strategy on which to build an economic future. However, the scientists at PARC believed, with good reason, that the costs would soon drop to affordable levels. Lampson in a guest editorial in a 1972 issue of Software - Practice and Experience predicted that within five years, it would be possible to build a computer: “comparable to a 360/65 in computing power for a manufacturing cost of perhaps $500.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc260&quot; href=&quot;#fn260&quot;&gt;260&lt;/a&gt; So the problem of costs seemed more short term, yet real enough to preclude action unless a solution could be found. In response, Thacker conceived multi-tasking&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc261&quot; href=&quot;#fn261&quot;&gt;261&lt;/a&gt; – the computer would work on many tasks all at the same time. There were various forms of multi-tasking to support timesharing.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc262&quot; href=&quot;#fn262&quot;&gt;262&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alto computer, or workstation, would be powerful enough to satisfy the computational needs of a single user. It would have a high-resolution bit-mapped display, with the resolution of a full page of multi-font text – what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) quality – and a highly interactive user interface with cursor control provided by a mouse – invented by Doug Engelbart and his group at SRI. To constitute an office information system, a large number of Altos would be inter-connected with a local area network, Ethernet. Specialized computers for services that could be shared either logically or for reasons of cost would also reside on the network. (Little will now be said of Ethernet, or local area networks, for they represent the second paradigm of computer communications and will be reconstructed in detail in future chapters. Hence, PARC will be visited more fully later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alto display system was first demonstrated at PARC in November 1972. By April 1973, an Alto worked – a year later there were forty of them. During this period and subsequently, it would take on its finished look when enhanced by Ethernet, the first laser printer and application software, in particular word processing (Bravo and Gypsy) and electronic mail (Grapevine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, SDS struggled. First there was the mismatch of SDS’s products, both hardware and software, and the needs of the market. Then SDS was slammed by the slow down in government spending and the computer recession of 1970-71. In response, in 1972, Xerox reorganized SDS, eliminating it as a separate business unit with its own general manager, and merged it into the copier operations. It continued to lose money, forcing yet another change in strategy in 1973 – no longer would SDS-Xerox compete head-on-head with IBM. Like GE and RCA, SDS-Xerox found it could not match the first-mover advantages and market power of IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The June 1975 issue of Business Week described IBM and Xerox as two of the big winners in office automation. It mattered little. By the Xerox’s Board of Director’s meeting the following month, the painful decision could no longer be avoided. No hope existed either of turning their computer business around or of selling it to anyone else. The only real option was to shut SDS down, take the loss – an estimated $1.3 billion&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc263&quot; href=&quot;#fn263&quot;&gt;263&lt;/a&gt; – and get on with life. McColough rationalized the action at the time by saying that Xerox did not have to sell stand-alone computers, it only had to be able to handle “information in digital form.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc264&quot; href=&quot;#fn264&quot;&gt;264&lt;/a&gt; Later he admitted: “In retrospect, the Scientific Data acquisition was a mistake.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc265&quot; href=&quot;#fn265&quot;&gt;265&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the SDS employees were assigned the task of building hundreds of Alto II – a refined design – shipped primarily within Xerox. Also in 1975, a Systems Development Division (SDD) was created to productize PARC technologies. In 1976, John Ellenby, the leader of the Alto II project, proposed building an Alto III, but an alternative design, one advanced by the Office Systems Division (OSD) in Dallas, won out. Those at PARC and SDD felt shunted aside. In 1977, McColough asked Ellenby to prepare a massive demonstration of PARC technology for a “Futures Day” World Conference for Xerox executives and management. It came off without hitch and impressed all. Even so, nothing happened. SDD, under the leadership of David Liddle, persisted in trying to gain support for their product ideas within OSD, but without any success. In 1978, Xerox reorganized OSD, in essence closing it down and combining it with the copier operations. That didn’t work. In 1979, OSD was re-established under the leadership of Don Massaro, who joined Xerox by way of the acquisition of the disk drive company he helped found, Shugart Associates. All the while the Alto technology remained suspended in organization mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1979, Ellenby and Liddle traveled to Dallas to present the product plans of SDD to Massaro. Massaro saw immediately the possibilities and encouraged Liddle. Subject to organizational approvals, OSD would market and sell the Star System SDD was developing. Star was intended to be a next generation Alto, both lower in cost and higher in performance. They got the go-ahead and in February 1980 began preparing for shipment in the spring of 1981. The Alto technology finally appeared on track to be commercialized. In April 1981, Xerox OSD began shipping the Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the Star proved a dead-end. It was too expensive, not functional enough - it didn’t have a spreadsheet – and totally proprietary. Xerox would not compete in the market for desktop computers either. Yet, mastering digital technologies to the extent they did, enabled Xerox to remain competitive in copiers and printing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any lead time Xerox had disappeared in the nine years that elapsed from the first working Alto to shipment of the Star. In August, IBM shipped the IBM Personal Computer. At first it hardly resembled the Star, but in time, thanks to the visionary developments at PARC, the way had been cleared and personal computers brought an end to corporate information systems centered around the mainframe computer.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The first three decades (1945-1975) of computer innovation and economics were motivated and financed first by government and then corporate interests. Although computers had come a long way from being measured by the ton and thenumber of rooms they occupied, they remained expensive, hard to use, and without any practical value to individuals. With over one hundred thousand computers in use, individuals were becoming increasingly informed about computers and their use at work. As importantly, young people, teenagers and college students, began to view computers not as technological marvels to be mastered by only a few, but as the new jalopies, to be torn apart, re-built and even improved upon. This then begins the story of how computers became products for individuals, not just organizations, and in so doing expanded the market potential to hundreds of millions not hundreds of thousands of units. In the process, the personal computer dislodged both mainframes and minicomputers from their hallowed role as the centerpieces of corporate information systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trajectory of personal computers began in the same MIT Lincoln Labs so important to mainframe and minicomputers. In the development of SAGE, those writing computer code began interacting directly with the computer, not by batch-processing. As they quickly learned, real time computing held significant benefits for individuals as users not just large applications such as SAGE. Among the first to recognize and write about computers designed for use by humans was Dr. J.C.R. Licklider. As noted earlier, the TX-2 computer was the first instantiation of a computer used by a person, not simply embedded in a larger application (although neither its original design nor long-term use was as a personal computer). The first computer designed as a personal computer was the Alto of Xerox PARC – a design influenced by the TX-2. As important as many of the design concepts of the Alto would become to future personal computers, it was not the Alto that most influenced the early years of competition. That role was assumed by the unlikely candidate of an inexpensive hobby kit microcomputer – the Altair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The January 1975 cover of Popular Electronics displayed the Altair 8800 and proclaimed: “The most powerful minicomputer project ever presented – can be built for under $400.” Intended to be sold to individuals, not organizations, the Altair 8800 by MITS (Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems) of Albuquerque, New Mexico&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc266&quot; href=&quot;#fn266&quot;&gt;266&lt;/a&gt; was not the result of a well planned strategy. Rather it represented a last ditch effort by a failing calculator company to avoid bankruptcy. Years earlier, in 1969, when Ed Roberts, the founder and president of MITS, decided to innovate calculators for sale, it made sense. But by early 1974, small firms like MITS couldn’t buy components for what others were selling finished product. Prices had dropped from $150 in 1973 to an average price of $26.25 in 1974 due to aggressive pricing by semiconductor entrants like Texas Instruments and National Semiconductors. MITS, whose calculator sold for $99.95, faced sure bankruptcy. But Roberts had been having thoughts of a new product, and not another calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivated more by technological challenge than business success, Roberts toyed with the idea of designing a computer around a microprocessor. Now facing certain disaster, yet also aware that the magazine Popular Electronics wanted to highlight a computer as a cover story, Roberts decided to go for broke and design a computer to be assembled by users. But what microprocessor? He decided to use the 8080 because it would execute the programming language BASIC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc267&quot; href=&quot;#fn267&quot;&gt;267&lt;/a&gt; He then negotiated a volume purchase agreement with Intel calling for a price of $75 for each 8080 compared to the list price of $360.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc268&quot; href=&quot;#fn268&quot;&gt;268&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts next reached an agreement with Popular Electronics. If he delivered his computer by a certain date, it would appear on the cover. Roberts then had to convince his bankers to loan him the $65,000 needed to invest in a prototype – he already owed them $300,000. Probably because they assessed the bleak prospects of repayment if they did not loan him the additional money, he got his loan.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc269&quot; href=&quot;#fn269&quot;&gt;269&lt;/a&gt; The bankers hoped for sales of 200 units; Roberts had illusions of 800 units. Just prior to the deadline with Popular Electronics, Roberts shipped his only prototype by Railway Express which lost it. Popular Electronics went to press with a cover photo of the computer’s front and top panels. Then they waited. Would they get as many as two hundred orders? After just two weeks, they had their answer. They needed help just to open the mail. Their bank account went from a $400,000 loan to a cash balance of $250,000.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc270&quot; href=&quot;#fn270&quot;&gt;270&lt;/a&gt; At a Homebrew Computer Club meeting in April 1975, members were told MITS had orders for 4,000 computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc271&quot; href=&quot;#fn271&quot;&gt;271&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those individuals interested in computers, the cover of Popular Electronics was a call to action. Some like Bill Gates and Paul Allen, desperate for any way to get in on what they saw as the coming growth in microcomputers, immediately contacted Roberts to see if he would be interested in selling their BASIC software. With so many offers, he told them all that he would do a deal with the first one to have BASIC working on the Altair. Six weeks later, Allen demonstrated their code to Roberts and a deal was struck. Newly named Micro-Soft (the future Microsoft) had made its first sale of microcomputer software.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc272&quot; href=&quot;#fn272&quot;&gt;272&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the success of the MITS/Altair was brief, its impact was long lasting. MITS and Altair made computers cheap, made them open, catalyzed third-party microcomputer software and set in motion institutional processes essential to the emerging personal computer market-structure. First, the Altair was cheap. The designers of the Alto viewed ten thousand dollars as a minimum, bare-bones, hardware cost. The Altair sold for $395. With its success, the Altair proved that individuals, not just organizations, would buy computers. And if it had not been the Altair, it would have been another microprocessor computer, Popular Electronics planned to run a cover story on computers and, as events proved, buying demand existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crucial contribution of the Altair was its open architecture. It had 18 slots in which additional computer-cards (printed circuit boards or PC boards or cards) could be inserted and made to interconnect to all the other boards by means of a bus – the electrical and physical characteristics of the board interconnecting all the slots. Others quickly realized that they could innovate computer-cards to both complement the Altair, although they might very well compete with MITS, as well as compete directly with the Altair. In 1976 alone, fifty hardware companies entered the market.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc273&quot; href=&quot;#fn273&quot;&gt;273&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By making the Altair open, MITS unintentionally benefited from as well as incented the creation of “external economies.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc274&quot; href=&quot;#fn274&quot;&gt;274&lt;/a&gt; External economies sprang up as other products and firms – the market – made available what MITS did not, or could not, offer for sale. MITS had to let users insert PC boards at a later date because initially they were unable to supply all the PC boards promised or needed. These empty slots made it possible for others to begin supplying competitive memory and input/output boards, or boards with entirely novel functionality. As a struggling small company, MITS was in no position to command the “internal economies” of doing everything within its organization as had IBM with the System/360 or DEC with the VAX-11/780.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the Altair created a necessary condition for the emergence of third-party software firms, such as Microsoft. MITS did not develop user application software. Yet software that made the Altair useful. In one sense, software defined subsequent microcomputer dynamics just as the microprocessor had – although very little will be said about these important issues here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, MITS and Altair set in motion processes and conditions which created essential institutions of personal computers. For example, computer clubs, newsletters, trade shows, and trade magazines developed. Computer clubs and newsletters sprang up, initially with a MITS/Altair focus, but soon without vendor preference. These informal institutions made it easy and non-threatening for interested individuals to learn and share information and knowledge – information and knowledge not forthcoming from the small vendors. The most influential club was the Homebrew Computer Club of Palo Alto, CA. It became a veritable beehive of entrepreneurial activity. Trade shows also went from Altair specific to vendor independent – MITS held the first in March 1976, and by August a vendor independent one was held.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc275&quot; href=&quot;#fn275&quot;&gt;275&lt;/a&gt; Soon the clubs and trade shows were complemented by new trade magazines. These were all mechanisms of information and knowledge diffusion that facilitated the rapid spread of microprocessor technologies to the economic sector as had government actions in the earlier trajectories of transistors and integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost overnight, competition to MITS and Altair emerged. And no wonder – from the verge of bankruptcy at the beginning of 1975, MITS’s revenues soared to $13 million in 1976.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc276&quot; href=&quot;#fn276&quot;&gt;276&lt;/a&gt; IMSAI Manufacturing fought the battle of imitation first by selling kits in 1975 and then assembled computers in 1976. It soon dominated the sales of ‘Altair’ microcomputers, selling 13,000 units through 1978&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc277&quot; href=&quot;#fn277&quot;&gt;277&lt;/a&gt; before collapsing into bankruptcy in the spring of 1979.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc278&quot; href=&quot;#fn278&quot;&gt;278&lt;/a&gt; Then there were those who tried alternative microprocessors: such as Southwest Technical Products using Motorola’s 6800; or created their own microprocessors as had MOS Technology, a start-up founded by Chuck Peddle selling the KIM-1 computer built using its own, inexpensive, 6502 microprocessor. (Peddle previously worked at Motorola and helped design the 6800. As might be expected the 6502 resembled the 6800.) Then came existing firms. In October 1976, Commodore bought MOS Technology, a serious threat because Commodore believed to have the resources to dominate the market. Others created their own computers. Tandy Corporation with its Radio Shack stores as distribution system introduced a Z-80 based microcomputer, the TRS-80 Model I, in August 1977. Texas Instruments would be second to only Commodore in market share in 1981.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc279&quot; href=&quot;#fn279&quot;&gt;279&lt;/a&gt; MITS, however, would not participate in the growth of the market-structure it helped launch. Countless organizational problems forced its sale to Pertec in May 1977 and operations ceased only two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Computer was the most important early computer start-up. The story of Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak is well known. They were “phone phreaks,” Silicon Valley teenagers undaunted by new technologies, who attended Homebrew Club meetings, then couldn’t get their employers – Hewlett Packard or Atari – interested in their vision of personal computers. Frustrated, yet confident that the market for personal computers was large and growing, they founded Apple Computer in 1976 and introduced the Apple II at a trade show in 1977. The Apple II continued in the vein of the Altair: it was open, encouraged and benefited from third-party software, and made use of external economies. Empty slots made the Apple II open. And while Apple supplied the proprietary operating system, software developers were encouraged to supply application software. The most important software was Visicalc – the first spreadsheet. Visicalc, along with word processing software, made the Apple II attractive to professionals and individuals. By outsourcing everything they could, Apple relied on market availability, not internal development or operations, for the components and manufacturing resources needed to build the Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apple II was an immediate success; revenues in 1978 reached almost $8 million. Jobs began designing their next computer: the Apple III. In a clash of vision with Wozniak, Jobs made it a closed system with no empty slots. At first the Apple III proved unreliable –a reputation it would never overcome. Only 65,000 were ever sold; less than the number of Apple II’s sold in 1980, the year the Apple III was introduced. It reportedly cost Apple $100 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc280&quot; href=&quot;#fn280&quot;&gt;280&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1979, Xerox’s venture capital arm, considering an investment in Apple, arranged a tour of Xerox PARC for Jobs. There he saw the Alto with bit-mapped display, graphical objects, fonts, windows and all controlled by a mouse. He also saw Ethernet, a way for personal computers to share resources and interconnect. “I was blown away,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc281&quot; href=&quot;#fn281&quot;&gt;281&lt;/a&gt; Jobs said later. Shortly afterwards he recruited Larry Tessler from PARC and charged him with the design of the Lisa computer –heavily influenced by the architecture of the Alto. But it was painfully slow and way too expensive – $10,000.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc282&quot; href=&quot;#fn282&quot;&gt;282&lt;/a&gt; It too cost Apple, maybe as much as the Apple III did. Without newly competitive product in a product category experiencing rapid new product introduction, the Apple’s market share plummeted from 13.5% in 1981 to 6.9% in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lisa set Apple on a new course of computer design, however, strongly influencing their next computer, the Macintosh, introduced in January 1984. The Macintosh set the standard for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the personal computer. Even so, Apple never captured the glory once theirs. A new personal computer architecture had arrived – one even more open than was Apple’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-1980, executives at IBM had reason to be worried. It had become very clear to them that IBM needed to sell a personal computer. Their customers asked about them and clearly planned to buy desktop computers, even if only for spreadsheet use. Competitors were entering the market like Xerox, which had introduced a Z-80-based Xerox 820. IBM also knew of the Alto and was shocked to see television advertisements extolling the promises of their Star computer. Then there was Exxon buying up companies to make an assault on the office market. And there could be no doubting the demand for personal computers was growing rapidly – Apple’s IPO of December 1980 was widely anticipated. The Corporate Management Committee (CMC) and President John Opel assigned William Lowe the task of recommending a course of action. In July he reported: “The only way we can get into the personal computer business is to go out and buy part of a computer company, or buy both the CPU and software from people like Apple or Atari – because we can’t do this within the culture of IBM.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurring but strongly preferring to sell their own computer, not one of another manufacturer, Lowe and a dozen engineers he assembled were given a month to come up with a prototype design. They first contacted a number of potential suppliers, including Intel and Microsoft. They decided to use the Intel 8088 over the Motorola and Zilog chips. Originally they saw Microsoft as a vendor for BASIC, but they asked Microsoft to write a report on how the two firms could interact. Knowing IBM was going to use the 16-bit 8088 and that the dominant operating system, CP/M of DIgital Research, would have to be re-written, Microsoft succeeded in selling IBM on a new operating system, MS-DOS or PC-DOS – one Microsoft would buy from Seattle Computer Products and up-grade as needed. In addition to supplying both operating system and BASIC, Microsoft, and in particular, Bill Gates, strongly influenced IBM to make their design open. IBM entered the personal computer market-structure leveraging external economies rather than doing everything internally as it had so successfully with the System/360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1981 proved critical in the history of the personal computer. In March, Osborne Corporation introduced the Osborne I, a complete computer with application software bundled into the base price of $1,795, and it was portable, or as described then – “luggable.” It was Z-80 based and came with word processing, spreadsheet and data base software. It was an immediate hit. Osborne sales were $6 million in 1981, $70 million in 1982, $93 million in 1983, before declaring bankruptcy in 1984. In the spring of 1981, Xerox introduced the Star for $16,595. Then IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer, or PC, on August 12. Before the end of the year, 13,000 PC’s were shipped.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc283&quot; href=&quot;#fn283&quot;&gt;283&lt;/a&gt; IBM had captured the dominant design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took but a couple of years for the trajectory of personal computers to go from competitive to one of a dominant design. 1982 was the year everyone grew. It was confusing – most of all to corporate customers. According to Business Week of August 2, 1982: “at least 140 new companies have sprung up since 1977.” Well over fifty companies competed in selling microcomputers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc284&quot; href=&quot;#fn284&quot;&gt;284&lt;/a&gt; In the midst of the confusion, buying demand, especially corporate buying demand, sought vendors such as IBM who were more stable and would survive. In 1983, IBM rocketed to a 26% market share. Michele S. Preston, an industry analyst with L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, an investment bank, was quoted in the October 3, 1983 issue of Business Week: “The biggest surprise has been how quickly, and to what extent, IBM has become so dominant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM PC became the dominant design for many reasons: it captured the transition to 16-bit processers, was an open system, made best advantage of external economies, and carried the IBM name. Most competitors used 8-bit processors, so IBM was first to capture the benefits of 16-bit processers. (This opportunity was the same as the jumps from 8 to 16 and then to 32-bit processers in minicomputers.) The PC’s openness encouraged both feature and price competition – all to the benefit of the user. (Companies making “clones” of the PC emerged. Compaq became the first company ever to do $100 million in sales in its very first year.) Buying, not making, enabled IBM to take every advantage of existing external economies. And, of course, there was the market and financial power of IBM and its control of corporate computing. Interestingly, the growth of the PC threatened IBM’s traditional customers – the Management Information Systems departments. Much more will be said in the coming history of computer communications on this transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumping ahead to the end of 1988, a comparison of costs between the three systems of computer use – personal computers, minicomputers or mainframe computers – displayed how compelling the economics were for personal computers. In data reported in the June 5, 1989 Business Week for a sample costs of a network of 20 workstations using personal computers versus terminals connected to either a minicomputer or mainframe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-227-comparative-cost-of-computer-networks-285&quot;&gt;Exhibit 2.27 Comparative Cost of Computer Networks &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc285&quot; href=&quot;#fn285&quot;&gt;285&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;PC network&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$95,000&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Terminals tied to a minicomputer&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$30,0000&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Terminals tied to a mainframe&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$6 million&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate computing rapidly adopted the architecture first advanced with the Alto: personal workstations, communications networks, and specialized servers. It became known as client/server computing and clashed with the host-centric computing that had prevailed for nearly two decades. In the process, corporations began wanting all their computers to be interconnected to form corporate-wide information networks. But to do so required interconnecting computers over telephone networks as well as constructing networks not controlled by the telecommunication firms, especially the giant AT&amp;amp;T. None of which was possible in 1968, when telecommunications was a regulated monopoly extant AT&amp;amp;T. How the freedoms of attachment and interconnection were won will be told next – in Chapter 2. Changing Rules of Competition - AT&amp;amp;T and the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Innovation of information technologies became a priority for the military after World War II. In funding the SAGE (Semiautomatic Ground Environment) air defense system beginning in 1951, the Air Force accelerated technological change in ways that could never have been imagined. One modest subcontract called for AT&amp;amp;T to innovate a device to transmit digital information over telephone lines. That device would be later modified and introduced commercially as a modem by AT&amp;amp;T in February 1958. It marked the beginnings of the economic history of computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T had the nascent modem market to itself until the mid-1960s. Then growing demand for faster modems than those supplied by AT&amp;amp;T led to a surge in entrepreneurism and competition. Two of the first new entrants, Codex and Milgo, would enter the modem business to escape their uncertain futures as military contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even as competition emerged, the regulated AT&amp;amp;T had the power to prohibit connection of equipment other than its own to the telephone network. In 1965, Thomas Carter filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;amp;T challenging those rights. Carter proved to be but the tip of an iceberg, one whose hidden importance was being shaped by the explosive growth in the use of computers by corporations. Concerned that the regulatory protection AT&amp;amp;T enjoyed might thwart the emergence of data processing, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) launched a public inquiry into the issues in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing use of computers, abetted by the commercialization of time-sharing, drove the growth and innovation of not only modems but also multiplexers. In 1968, a start-up, American Data Systems, introduced a second-generation multiplexer; dramatically increasing the number of computer devices, primarily terminals, that could share a telephone line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1967, years of aggressive government spending raised inflation concerns and financial investors turned to stocks for price appreciation, not just dividends, and in the process drove the prices of technology stocks to unprecedented levels. Aggressive investors funneled market profits into venture capital funds that in turn sought investments in exciting technologies, especially those related to computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clash between those wanting to connect innovative equipment to the telephone network and the long-standing regulatory policy supporting AT&amp;amp;T sped to an unexpected outcome by the end of 1968. The history of data, and thus computer, communications was about to become significantly more complex, and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/3.1/Beginnings-of-Modem-Competition-Codex-and-Milgo-1956-1967/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Starting a company does not always begin with a grand vision of the future. Sometimes the motivation can be wanting simply to do what one enjoys most. Other times it might be the unwillingness to work for others. More often it is some odd combination of reasoning and feeling that is less important that having acted, as if what else would one have done. Such was the case for Jim Cryer and Arthur Kohlenberg in 1962 when their employer, Melpar Electronics, informed them that they were closing the advanced research laboratory they had been running as director and chief scientist, respectively. Even though offered the option to move to Virginia, both men had little desire to leave the Boston area. Rather they believed that they could win technology development contracts being let by government agencies. So they incorporated a new company, Codex, and joined thousands of other companies swept up in the Federal government’s funding of technology innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 1960’s were a remarkable period for scientists and engineers with an entrepreneurial itch. Federal government funding for technological innovation seemed bottomless. Following President John F. Kennedy’s challenge in May 1961 to put a man on the moon, funding for advanced technologies surged again, adding to the sizable increases that began after World War II when military spending grew to counter the global threat of the USSR and communism. One of the most important investments in the history of information technologies was the Air Force’s SAGE (Semiautomatic Ground Environment) project; an air defense system undertaken in 1951 to detect Soviet aircraft coming over polar routes. When the USSR launched Sputnik in October 1957, US fear shifted into over-drive. Science and engineering became instant national priorities. In 1958, the ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) and NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) were created and monies flowed to technology as never before. Then came President Kennedy’s rallying vision in 1961. The large government defense contractors found themselves too busy to compete for every new contract, nor able to maintain technical superiority given the explosion in new technologies. Opportunities lay everywhere for a few scientists and engineers to form a company and win development contracts, even production orders. The Federal Government effectively boot-strapped technological innovation by playing both venture capital investor and ultimate customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryer and Kohlenberg knew just such an opportunity: the Air Force wanted better error-correcting codes for digital transmission over telephone lines. They also knew Robert Gallager, then a young professor at MIT, and his graduate student, Jim Massey, had developed new error-correcting techniques, thought a sure bet to secure a development contract.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  Their instincts were right. Soon they had a contract to develop exotic error-correcting codes for the Air Force’s Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS): the successor to SAGE. BMEWS generated radar data in Northern Canada that was then transmitted over telephone lines to computers in the States. The long telephone lines frequently experienced noise, or worse yet, power outages, that corrupted or destroyed the data being transmitted. Error-correcting codes were needed to restore the lost data. Better codes required more of the total capacity of the communication lines, or bandwidth, leaving less bandwidth for radar data. More powerful codes also stimulated the need for faster modems: the devices that transmit the discrete 0’s and 1’s of digital data, or information, over the continuously varying analog voltage of telephone lines. (See Exhibit 3.1.0 Modem.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-310-modem&quot;&gt;Exhibit 3.1.0 Modem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/modem-example.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modem Diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modems were first innovated by AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs for the Air Force as part of the SAGE project. Those modems transmitted data from remote radar sites in Canada to IBM 790 computers in the United States at the speed of 2000 bits per second (bps).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  A paper, “Transmission of Digital Information over Telephone Circuits,” describing this first modem implementation was published in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1955.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  The name modem comes from its function: modulating, or suppressing, information onto a telephone line, and then demodulating, or recovering, the modulated information from the line. The design objective is to accurately transmit as many 0’s and 1’s as possible in a fixed period of time. Since each 0 or 1 is a bit, the convention is to rate modems by how many bits per second (bps) they transmit.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  The faster the modem, the more challenging it is to innovate; particularly with lease-line modems, the ones of interest to Cryer and Kohlenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modems come in two types: dial-up or lease-line.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  Dial-up modems are used with the public switched telephone network (PSTN, or more familiarly, POTS: plain old telephone system). Lease-line modems are used with leased lines (also known as private or dedicated lines). The distinction is important for dial-up modems make connections when used and only incur telephone line charges for the time connected. The technical challenge arises from the fact that a user may not be using a dial-up modem from the same manufacturer as the one being connected to. Hence, inter-compatibility or inter-operability, and the role of standards, are crucial. Lease-line modems, on the other hand, always remain interconnected over a leased line and bear the cost of the line whether in use or not. Since lease-line modems are invariably from the same manufacturer, standards are less important than are the questions of speed and reliability. The two types of modems require very different technologies to be mastered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modem AT&amp;amp;T introduced in February 1958, the Bell System Data Set 103, was a 300 bps dial-up modem. At the time, no one thought 300 bps unduly restrictive as neither computer terminals nor most printers operated at faster speeds. Next AT&amp;amp;T introduced the 1200 bps Data Set 202 series, again dial-up modems. Finally, in 1962, they announced the 2400 bps Data Set 201 series for leased or private-lines.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  Throughout this period, AT&amp;amp;T had little competition. By 1965, however, competition emerged in lease-line modems where AT&amp;amp;T did not posse the monopoly powers they did for dial-up modems. This poised little immediate concern to AT&amp;amp;T as leased lines represented approximately 2 percent of telephone line use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speed had mattered from the beginning. Even before taking possession of their first AT&amp;amp;T modems in the 1950’s, the Air Force wanted faster ones. The need for speed came from wanting to create and maintain a worldwide command and control system for air defense. Brigadier General H. R. Johnson, Director of Point to Point Planning for Headquarters Airways and Air Force Communications Systems (AFCS), USAF, from 1950 to 1955, remembers a senior member of his technical staff, Bill Pugh, calculating: “a suitable goal would be 10,000 bits per second in a voice band” for modems. That goal was then set forth in 1956 in: “the proposed General Operational Requirement that AFCS sent to the Air Force, which subsequently became the research document for the Air Force Communications System.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  Yet a decade later, reliable modems operating at that speed remained an illusive goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such was the background in 1966, when Cryer and Kohlenberg began taking seriously the idea of Codex developing a lease-line modem to sell to the Air Force. That they knew the Air Force yearned for higher speed modems for their air defense system made the opportunity seem a sure bet. Only to-date, they had little experience, or for that matter any real interest, in selling products. Their competence lay in solving difficult technical problems, not in managing what they imagined as the boring business of stamping out the same products, day-in, day-out. The very prospect demeaned Codex’s proud corporate ethos of: “if not technically challenging, it was not worth doing.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  Even so, Cryer and Kohlenberg worried about Codex’s dependence on the feast-or-famine nature of government contracts; when sales could be $1 million one year and nothing the next. Selling a product, such as modems, did have imagined advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussing the subject with MIT’s Gallagher, Cryer and Kohlenberg learned a high-speed 9600 bits per second (bps) modem - four times faster than the fastest commercial modem then available from AT&amp;amp;T - was possible. Wanting to know how, Gallagher told them about Jerry Holsinger, a 1965 MIT Ph.D. graduate whose thesis had been on high-speed data transmission over telephone lines. He last heard Holsinger had left MIT Lincoln Labs and was employed by a small R&amp;amp;D shop on the West Coast named Defense Research Company (DRC). Intrigued, Cryer and Kohlenberg convinced themselves that a 9600 bps modem would give Codex the competitive edge and hopefully the financial security they needed to be successful while upholding their proud tradition of solving hard problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On meeting Holsinger in early 1967, Cryer and Kohlenberg discovered he had already formed a company, Teldata, and was soliciting investment from venture capitalists or anyone else who had money. Holsinger claimed he had a working prototype of a 9600 bps modem, one developed at Defense Research Corporation with funding from the National Security Agency (NSA).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  He confided his original design had not worked on normal telephone lines, but he had perfected the design, and had a working breadboard prototype.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;  All he needed to do was convert his modem to printed circuit boards to have the world’s first 9600 bps modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holsinger thought of himself as an entrepreneur, not an employee working for a salary or as a research scientist. Only he was having trouble convincing others that they should invest their money with him, not surprisingly given he lacked business experience and was only two years out of graduate school. Cryer and Kohlenberg persuaded Holsinger they were serious about building a modem business and, lacking an alternative, Holsinger agreed to sell Teldata to Codex in May 1967. Codex acquired 82.36% of Teldata’s shares for $94,000.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex embarked on its journey into modems by way of acquisition. Many other defense contractors and electronic companies, like Rixon Electronics, Collins Radio and Stelma, began selling modems, like AT&amp;amp;T had, by using technology they developed for the government. The first independent company really to challenge AT&amp;amp;T, Milgo Electronics Corporation (Milgo), hired a talented individual, Sang Whang, and funded the project internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monroe Miller and Lloyd Gordon, hence the name Milgo, had served the defense agencies and NASA ever since founding their company in 1956. They, like Cryer and Kohlenberg, learned that NASA and military agencies wanted faster modems. In 1965, they hired Sang Whang out of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute to develop a line of modems to sell to the Kennedy Space Center for down range instrumentation. In 1967, Milgo introduced its commercial 2400 bps modem, the 4400/24PB. Edward Bleckner, head of Milgo’s efforts to enter the modem business, hired an executive search firm to find a seasoned sales/marketing executive with modem experience. They luckily caught up with Matt Kinney on the telephone as he was stranded in an airport by a snowstorm. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They asked me if I’d like to come and talk to them about a job, and I said:  “Where are you?”  They said:  “Miami, FL.” The answer:  ‘You bet your sweet life!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In joining Milgo in January 1968, Kinney brought to Milgo needed experience in selling commercial data communication products and an understanding that significant changes might soon propel the demand for data communications; that is, if Tom Carter won his case against AT&amp;amp;T. Kinney remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tom Carter is one of my oldest and dearest friends. Hell I knew in ‘66 that if Carter prevailed, which seemed highly unlikely at the time, that the industry would take off.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Few believed Thomas Carter had a chance. An easy-going Texan, inventor and modest entrepreneur, Carter had been hassled by AT&amp;amp;T ever since he began selling the Carterfone in 1959. Even more seriously, AT&amp;amp;T threatened to suspend telephone service on lines using Carterfones; all this fuss over a modest device making voice connections between mobile radios and the telephone network possible.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 1.1 - Carterfone) So that people on oilrigs or in remote locations might talk to their superiors or family; yet a product that AT&amp;amp;T did not sell, nor would they tariff – permit to be attached to the public telephone switched network (PTSN).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many advantages AT&amp;amp;T enjoyed, as a regulated monopoly, was the right to prevent products made or sold by others from being attached to “their” telephone network. Non-AT&amp;amp;T products were considered “foreign attachments.” This is important to the history of modems, for while AT&amp;amp;T did allow lease-line modems obtained from competition to be attached to lines they leased, AT&amp;amp;T would not let competitor dial-up modems, modems that by definition were attached to the PTSN, be used by their customers; virtually any person or organization using a telephone. This posed a very big problem for companies like Carter Electronics wanting to offer customers solutions that necessitated use of the PTSN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since AT&amp;amp;T would neither agree to re-sell the Carterfone or tariff it, Carterfone became a foreign attachment no customers could use legally. Carter’s lawyers advised him he had no recourse against the regulated AT&amp;amp;T but to file an anti-trust lawsuit. So on November 29, 1965, he did: Thomas F. Carter and Carter Electronics Corporation v. American Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph Company et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why no one, including his friends, thought Carter, had a chance requires a skip back in time to the Hush-A-Phone, a foreign attachment seemingly as innocuous as a Carterfone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 22, 1948, the Hush-A-Phone Corporation (HAPC) filed an antitrust suit against AT&amp;amp;T; charging AT&amp;amp;T prohibited telephone subscribers from using its product: the Hush-A-Phone. Available since 1929, the Hush-A-Phone was simply a plastic cup that fit over the telephone microphone to increase the privacy of telephone conversations and to reduce extraneous noise. As harmless as it would seem, AT&amp;amp;T and the Bell operating companies viewed the Foreign Attachment Tariff Restrictions as banning not only electrical interconnections, but attachments of any kind.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; In place since 1913, the Tariff read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No equipment, apparatus, circuit or device not furnished by the Telephone Company shall be attached to or connected with the facilities furnished by the Telephone Company, whether physically, by induction or otherwise, except as provided in this tariff.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the agency that regulates AT&amp;amp;T, held the HAPC hearings in 1950. AT&amp;amp;T argued, among other things, that the Hush-A-Phone distorted speech, and any one in this country might be called by, or might call, someone using a Hush-A-Phone and, consequently, they are going to get a lousy telephone call. That’s harm. They’re not getting what they paid for. Six years later, the FCC ruled in favor of AT&amp;amp;T, accepting the logic of inducing a bad phone call and displaying an unwillingness to challenge the prohibition on foreign attachments. HAPC then took the unusual step for the day and appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 21, 1955, the Court ruled in favor of HAPC. Reasoning that the same effect of the Hush-A-Phone plastic cup could be created by cupping one’s hands around the microphone, Judge David Bazelon wrote the tariff was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;unwarranted interference with the telephone subscriber’s right reasonably to use his telephone in ways which are privately beneficial without being publicly detrimental. Prescribing what changes should be made in the tariffs to render them “just, fair, and reasonable” and determining what orders may be required to prohibit violation of subscribers’ rights thereunder are functions entrusted to the Commission.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither the FCC nor AT&amp;amp;T appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court, treating the Appeal Court’s decision as essentially “no big deal.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;  AT&amp;amp;T filed a new tariff that permitted foreign attachments as long as they did not “endanger telephone employees, property or service.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; They also tariffed the Hush-A-Phone.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;  Only the world did not change for other competitors wanting to sell products, such as dial-up modems, to customers connected to the PTSN. Those manufacturers had to get AT&amp;amp;T to either resell their product or agree to tariff it because it did not endanger. If AT&amp;amp;T wouldn’t, that competitor was compelled to file an anti-trust lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later, an even more important signal that AT&amp;amp;T could ban foreign attachments played out. The Eisenhower Administration ended an antitrust suit that had been filed against AT&amp;amp;T in 1949 by the Truman Administration. That suit had attempted to divest AT&amp;amp;T of Western Electric (WE), its manufacturing and product operations. The intent had been to end AT&amp;amp;T’s monopoly over telephone equipment. In 1956, AT&amp;amp;T’s rights were affirmed and the antitrust suit dropped. Between the HAPC case and the termination of the antitrust suit, AT&amp;amp;T, with the help of the FCC, government and courts, had steeled itself against change and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter clearly faced an uphill battle. One quickly put on hold when the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, referred the case to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. The Court wanted guidance as to the legality of the tariff permitting telephone companies to suspend, or terminate, service if foreign attachments were connected to telephone company facilities.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;  At the FCC, the Carterfone case was referred to the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB), the organizational arm responsible for AT&amp;amp;T tariffing. There it joined a long list of other important issues.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;  Hearings were scheduled for the following year, in April 1967.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;  The glacial movement of law was about to encounter the suddenness of technological change.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By the time the Carterfone case had irked AT&amp;amp;T executives, a more serious challenge had emerged. Corporations were beginning to use computers on a scale never imagined, increasingly involving communications over the telephone network. AT&amp;amp;T management’s instinctual reaction was to resist any use of the telephone network that they did not control. Only these new uses also represented a potential source of revenue growth if AT&amp;amp;T could exercise its regulatory powers. Extending the reach of regulation into the competitive computer market set AT&amp;amp;T against IBM and likely every one of their corporate customers, and created problems vastly more complex than squashing some pesky entrepreneur from Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the mid-1960’s, computers had become a fast growing business because they were desperately needed and were finally becoming usable and affordable. This compelling combination of need and solution propelled the sales of computers from $600 million in 1960 to $7 billion in 1968 – a compounded growth rate of 36 percent a year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; No wonder AT&amp;amp;T executives contemplated how to grab a piece of the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate executives needed computers to cope with an increasingly complex world. In part that complexity was being driven by technology. As H. Igor Ansoff wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 1965:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 20-year period since World War II has seen a continuing acceleration of product change. Triggered by accumulated technology and pent-up consumer demand, product innovation has become an increasingly important tool of competition and growth. To the business manager it has brought both opportunities and problems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid proliferation of products, shorter product life cycles, emergence of entirely new markets, slowing growth in more traditional markets, and potential globalization of everything, all contributed to the felt need by executives for not only computers, but computers capable of providing information both “real-time” and “on-line.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; The needs that earlier had driven development of the SAGE air defense system now permeated the language of corporate management. Indicative of how important the computer had become, a 1967 survey by the management consulting firm Booz, Allen &amp;amp; Hamilton concludes:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day may not be far distant when those who analyze annual businessfailures can add another category to their list of causes – failure to exploit the computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate America did not have a computer that was truly usable and affordable until roughly 1966. That computer, announced in grand style on April 7, 1964, by Thomas Watson Jr. and the management of IBM, was the Sytem/360 series of computers. Costing an estimated $5 billion to develop, the System/360 represents the beginning of the third generation of mainframe computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; IBM sold an unbelievable 1,000 System/360’s in the first thirty days. The System/360 consumed IBM management’s attention for years before becoming the product they announced that proud day, traumatized their customers into the future, and sent IBM’s competitors scrambling for survival. The effect was cataclysmic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;System/360 might never have happened if not for military funding motivated by the Korean War. In 1950, Thomas J. Watson, President and CEO, and father of the Watson Jr. who announced the System/360, managed an IBM that controlled 90% of the office machinery market. As for the prospects of computers, Watson Jr., remembers his father believing”the electronic computer would have no impact on the way IBM did business, because to him punch-card machines and giant computers belonged in totally separate realms.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Korean War broke out, Watson “put”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; IBM at President Truman’s disposal. After studying how best IBM might help, James Birkenstock, manager of the IBM Future Demands department, and scientist Cuthbert Hurd recommended IBM build a “general-purpose scientific” computer. The new computer – code named the Defense Calculator – became the most expensive investment in the company’s then history.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; It would become the basis for their commercial computers introduced in 1952. Watson Jr. remembers the subsequent confusion: “Our engineers and production mangers weren’t sure how to proceed.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding IBM’s deficiencies, Watson Jr. made it a priority to win a contract being let by MIT and the Air Force to develop a computer for the SAGE air defense system. Jay Forrester, the MIT scientist responsible for procurement, held serious discussions with Remington Rand, RCA, Raytheon, Sylvania, and IBM. In October 1952, he selected IBM to be the subcontractor assisting MIT’s Lincoln Laboratories finalize the SAGE computer design. For IBM, SAGE represented the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art computer technologies from the most advanced computer development laboratory in the world. But while IBM learned, staff at Lincoln Labs felt burdened. Norman Taylor, one of Forrester’s most trusted managers, remembers: “IBM seemed awful stupid to us. They were still designing circuits like radio and TV circuits.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1955, IBM completed the SAGE computer prototype. The AN/FSQ-7, or Q7, weighed 300 tons and occupied twenty thousand feet of floor space.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAGE air defense system became obsolete, however, before its full implementation: it had not been designed to track incoming missiles. Even so, it catapulted IBM from “stodgy company” to technological leader.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt; In 1954, a year before completing the SAGE prototype, IBM would introduce improvements - in part learned from designing SAGE - into its languishing 702 computer (the one based on the Defense Calculator) and reintroduced it as the 704. &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt; Acclaimed a “creative masterpiece,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt; the 704 established IBM as the market leader. The benefits of designing and building an advanced computer for the government were not lost on IBM management. After they lost a bid in 1955 to build a super fast computer for the University of California Radiation Laboratory, they sold a more aggressive design to Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; Although ultimately a failure, it contributed to the knowledge and skill needed to design and build the System/360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM rode the System/360 to great success and an estimated 70% of the mainframe computer market. Revenue soared from $2 billion in 1964 to $6.9 billion in 1968. Competing against only seven firms, known as the “Seven Dwarfs” (Burroughs, Control Data Corporation, General Electric, Honeywell, RCA, National Cash Register, and Sperry Rand’s Univac division), IBM, cast as “Snow White,” dictated what peripherals could be connected to its computers and even what software could be used. Competing against IBM proved crushingly difficult and prohibitively expensive.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1968 Business Week article assessed the growth of IBM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since it entered the computer business 15 years ago, IBM’s volume has increased 17 times (to $5.3 billion last year [1967]) and its net income has gone up 20 times (to $651.5-million). Last year, IBM zoomed past Texaco and U.S. Steel to become the nation’s eighth largest industrial company when it added $1.1-billion in revenues. That is like creating another Coca-Cola or another Celanese in just one year.  In Wall Street’s assessment, IBM is now the most valuable corporation around. Early this week, IBM’s common shares were worth $41.5-billion. The common shares of AT&amp;amp;T, with assets eight times larger, were worth $26.3-billion. The stock market appraises IBM stock as worth at least as much as the combined shares of 21 of the 30 companies that go to make up the Dow-Jones industrial average.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM did not always get everything right. In failing to follow the government’s lead into time-sharing, IBM had left a window of opportunity open to its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-sharing first surfaced as an idea in 1959, when Christopher Strachey, a British mathematician, gave a paper on time-sharing at a UNESCO congress. Near the same time, and working independently, Professor John McCarthy distributed an internal memo about time-sharing at MIT. Under the leadership of professor F.J. Corbato, the MIT Computational Center first demonstrated time-sharing in November 1961.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-sharing differed significantly from the batch-processing paradigm of computing embodied in IBM products, including the System/360. In time-sharing, many simultaneous users believe they have exclusive control of the computer; a sleight of hand made possible by the enormous speed of computers compared to the finger-pecking slowness of humans. In batch processing, one user, normally an operator processing users’ programs, had sole control of the computer, one job at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-sharing next benefited from the visionary leadership of Dr. Joesph Carl Robnett (J.C.R.) Licklider and his power to invest government funds. In October 1962, when Jack P. Ruina, the third director of ARPA, needed to hire a director of a newly created Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), he made as insightful and inspired a hire as one can make when recruiting Licklider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licklider, or simply “Lick” to all who knew him, espoused a radical new concept of computing. He saw the computer as more than just a fast numerical calculator. “Man-computer symbiosis,” as Licklider envisioned it, meant computers would participate as tightly coupled partners with humans, exploiting cooperative decision-making, enabling interactions not possible within the prevailing paradigm of computing, batch processing.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; Such “interactive computing” demanded significant advances in the state of computing, which was what made Licklider such an ideal person to head up an office dedicated to funding advanced information technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licklider, a psychologist, began his journey into the world of computers after he joined the electrical engineering department at MIT. In the summer of 1951 he became a member of Project Charles, the summer study group that contributed so significantly to the SAGE Project and the creation of Lincoln Laboratory.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt; He subsequently employed analog computers for his psyco-acoustic research and modeling. Then one late night in 1956, as he hovered over his paperwork, lost in thought, Licklider was interrupted by a curious Wesley Clark, one of Lincoln Labs most prominent computer designers who had played leading roles in the design of three of the first “small” computers, the TX-0, TX-2 and LINC. Clark remembers wandering into Lick’s basement room:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I found this fellow, and I introduced myself, and that turned out to be Lick, and he was clearly a very interesting guy. He was doing some psycho-physical experiments and we got to talking and explained to one another what we were up to. I invited him to come down to the TX-2.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big ideas can seed in the most unexpected places. Two scientists on chance meeting shared their professional enthusiasms and the words of one fractures implicit understandings of the other, creating space for new ideas to form and grow. Such was the case when Clark showed Licklider the TX-2. Licklider immediately understood digital computers would one day be small and personal. More than a tool to calculate, they would become a medium to transform the experience of living. In the flash of a moment, Licklider’s career switched course and, in time, so would the history of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1957, Licklider left MIT to join the small Cambridge firm of Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) to pursue his passion for human-computer interactions. He convinced BBN to buy the first PDP-1 minicomputer from the start-up firm Digital Equipment Company (DEC) He then attracted talent, such as Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, two of the future founders of artificial intelligence, and others, all drawn to his, Licklider’s, efforts to realize interactive computing. In 1960, he published his seminal paper: “Man-Computer Symbiosis,” describing a vastly grander vision of what computers could be than current conventional wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On joining ARPA in October 1962, Licklider had his vision of computing, a small office, a very large budget, and his knowledge and instincts of which individuals at what institutions were doing interesting research. In choosing projects advancing the state of computers and communications to fund, Licklider formalized his existing social network, transforming it into a network of individuals and institutions that would revolutionize computing and computer communications.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt; Licklider remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I went to ARPA there was the assumption that I was going to run a command and control project, and it was my conviction that you can’t really do command and control with batch processing. So I got agreement and we were off and running.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategically, Licklider focused his investments on thirteen different research projects, primarily at MIT; the University(s) of California at Berkeley, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles; University of Southern California (USC); Carnegie-Mellon University; the University of Utah; the RAND Institute; Stanford Research Institute (to become SRI International (SRI)); and Systems Development Corporation (SDC).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt; He selected projects on the basis of the talents of a few individuals at each organization, individuals who he personally knew. Licklider’s initial choice of projects, combined with his commitment to long-term funding, proved essential to his success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his most successful projects was Project MAC (Multiple-Access Computer). At the time, the Office of Naval Research had been funding research on time-sharing at MIT in the Information Processing Center.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc50&quot; href=&quot;#fn50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt; Licklider, desiring change, proposed that MIT create an inter-disciplinary, inter-departmental lab to build a time-sharing computer under the direction of Robert Fano. Fano, encouraged by Licklider, and with MIT’s agreement, submitted a proposal to ARPA, and in 1963 Project MAC received $2.2 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt; Project MAC would become the most influential organization and research effort in time-sharing. (Project Multics, another very influential time-sharing project, succeeded Project MAC.) By 1967, IPTO would be providing over $12 million to a dozen time-sharing projects, both at universities and at research organizations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt; The first computer company to emphasize time-sharing was General Electric (GE). In May 1964, a GE computer was used in a time-sharing demonstration at Dartmouth College.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt; That summer, GE announced all its 600 series computers would support time-sharing using software developed with Dartmouth. That fall, MIT surprised everyone with the announcement that it would buy a GE computer for its time-sharing operations. IBM scrambled.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would take two years before IBM announced their System 360/67 time-sharing computer in 1966.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt; Recognizing the importance of time-sharing, IBM stated it would represent 30% of the computer market. GE projected that by 1970, 75% of all computers would support time-sharing. Business Week projected a $2.5 billion time-sharing market in five years up from only $20 million in 1968.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-sharing became increasingly popular as the Computer Utility. In 1966, the resident computer expert at the FCC, Dr. Manley R. Irwin wrote in an article titled “The Computer Utility” for Datamation:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the next decade electronic data centers are expected to sell computational power to the general public in a way somewhat analogous to today’s distribution of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Computer Utility seemed a perfect metaphor in a time when computers were expensive, difficult to program, and required trained personnel who were in very short supply.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt; If computers were going to be used by most, if not all companies, then sharing made sense, especially given the success of the utility concept in both electricity and telephony.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc59&quot; href=&quot;#fn59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosion in growth of computer service bureaus seemed to validate the Computer Utility concept. Service bureaus, as either independent organizations or operations of computer manufacturers, sold computer time and services to other companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc60&quot; href=&quot;#fn60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt; Existing since the earliest days of commercial computing, it was not until time-sharing that service bureaus could support real-time access to many users at the same time. By 1966, an estimated 800 service bureaus generated $650 million in revenues – thought to be growing at 40% per year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc61&quot; href=&quot;#fn61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt; IBM, even though restricted as to how they could compete in the service bureau business by their 1956 Consent Decree with the Justice Department, ran two nationwide service bureaus.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc62&quot; href=&quot;#fn62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of Computer Utilities galvanized the logic of many users employing the telephone network to connect to distant computers. Customers required modems to transmit computer data, digital information, over the analog telephone network. Faster modems than those available from AT&amp;amp;T. This power of AT&amp;amp;T to restrict the right of attachment of equipment to the telephone network was what made the Carterfone case so important.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Before 1965, Bernard Strassburg, Chairman of the Common Carrier Bureau of the FCC, viewed the relationship between AT&amp;amp;T and the FCC as collaborative:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was truly a symbiotic relationship. The regulated monopoly operated in what was considered to be the public interest and, in turn, was shielded against incursions by rivals and competitors, including the possibility of government ownership.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc63&quot; href=&quot;#fn63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late 1966, however, Strassburg had radically rethought his view as he came to understand the importance of computers. He realized users would want to interconnect terminals and computers over the telephone network in ways certain to be resisted by AT&amp;amp;T. In a speech to an audience of computer professionals on October 20, 1966, he declared:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Few products of modern technology have as much potential for social, economic, and cultural benefit as does the multiple access computer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc64&quot; href=&quot;#fn64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg spoke of the problems of the coming convergence of computers and common carrier communications - telecommunications. He identified the problem of market entry: Who would be allowed to sell what products and services? Did AT&amp;amp;T have the right to monopolize products and services other’s wanted to sell? Strassburg also asserted the FCC’s role as being to support progress:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Commission is obliged by the policies and the objectives of the Communications Act to ensure that the nation’s communication network is responsive to the requirements of an advancing technology. The Commission has the obligation, the authority, and the means to reappraise and refashion any established policies in order to promote the public interest through an effective realization of the social and economic benefits of current technology.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc65&quot; href=&quot;#fn65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 9, 1966, the FCC, announced the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) would hold a public inquiry titled: Notice of Inquiry, In the Matter of Regulatory and Policy Problems Presented by the Interdependence of Computer and Communications Services and Facilities (Docket F.C.C. No. 16979).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc66&quot; href=&quot;#fn66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt; The Notice read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are confronted with determining under what circumstances data processing, computer information, and message switching services, or any particular combination thereof–whether engaged in by established common carriers or other entities–are or should be subject to the provisions of the Communications Act.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc67&quot; href=&quot;#fn67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strassburg began seeing the Carterfone case as a way to revisit the foreign attachments tariff. For it was becoming obvious that the prohibition of foreign attachment impeded data processing use of the telephone system and the innovation of communication devices. In Strassburg’s words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We used the Carterfone issue and the Carterfone proceeding as a vehicle for revisiting the policy, which was basically a Bell System policy, which had been embraced by the FCC and the regulatory commissions for many generations, against customers, willy-nilly, interconnecting anything they chose to the telephone network, no matter how innocuous it might be unless the item was specifically authorized by the telephone company’s tariffs. Well the telephone company wasn’t likely to tariff anything of consequence, so as a result, anytime anybody wanted to promote a piece of equipment and to have it work with the telephone network, they either had to sell it to the Bell System, if they could convince Western Electric and Bell that they had something sellable, or if they couldn’t succeed in that channel, then attacking the tariff insofar as the claim was unlawful – and that the   But that was a very cumbersome process to go through; the administrative hearing and the time and the cost involved that, to a small entrepreneur with a piece of equipment – it discouraged people.  It discouraged the market from developing, and that’s why, I think, the United States was so far behind other countries, in customer-premise equipment there was no entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurship was blunted and discouraged by this institutionalized practice of saying: ‘You can’t connect with us.’  In other words, everything that went on had to go on within the Bell System, Bell Laboratories. That was where innovation began and ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not entirely.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In June 1967, Jerry Holsinger, now working for Codex, began the challenge of converting his prototype 9600 bps lease-line modem into a shippable product. A year later, in May 1968, Codex introduced the AE-96, the world’s first 9600 bps modem. It weighed approximately 125 pounds, and consisted of sixty-six printed circuit boards of RTL semiconductor logic. When installed, every pair of modems needed to be manually “tuned” to the telephone circuit, and when the line characteristics changed, as they invariably did, the modems had to be re-tuned in order to work. Re-tuning was more than simply an inconvenience, it required qualified personnel to make adjustments to the modems at both ends of the telephone circuit at the same time - a serious problem given many early customers wanted to use the modems on expensive international circuits. As was true for many early electronic products using RTL logic, the AE-96 generated so much heat that keeping it cool presented a problem. Since each end of the circuit required an AE-96, the total cost for a customer was $46,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex management and the Board of Directors knew they needed to hire personnel with commercial experience if they were going to be successful. Jim Cryer, President of Codex, felt the most pressure to find someone to head sales and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art Carr needed little persuading. He recently had completed an assessment of the opportunities in data communications for Computer Control Corporation (or 3C, as it was fondly known) and recommended that the minicomputer manufacturer make data communications a strategic focus. No stranger to this new field, one of 3C’s best customers was the time-sharing operations of GE. Only Honeywell now owned 3C and, for reasons long forgotten, Carr’s recommendations were not adopted. The timing could not have been better for Codex. Carr, convinced of the emerging opportunities in data communications was ready to leave 3C. In his enthusiasm for data communications, he was even willing to overlook the fact that Codex lacked any commercial experience, telling himself that maybe their lack of experience meant freedom to run his own ‘show,’ the opportunity he really sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly coming to terms, the outwardly calm, yet intensely competitive, Carr joined Codex as Vice President of Marketing in July. Decades later, he still remembered his first day with the company:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jim Cryer, the founding president of Codex, was a fine man, but he was the world’s greatest optimist. It’s just beyond my ability to describe it to you, but I can give you an example. I started at the end of July at Codex. All of the orders that had ever been received in Codex in its corporate history, which then was about six years, were on three or four typed sheets of paper. They were strictly in the military business, some years you would get an order, and some years you wouldn’t. He had a memorandum waiting for me the day I started that was about four or five pages long that added up to six or seven million dollars of business that was about to close, and the very first thing – now this is a company that had just done a million dollars, OK, the very first thing I did was take a two week vacation. I said to him: ‘If you’ve got all this business lined up, I was going to go down to the Cape this year.’ And he said: ‘Oh, yeah, no problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryer then recruited James Storey as Vice President of Administration. Soon the increased costs began straining Codex’s financial resources. Without more money, all their efforts at self-transformation would mean little more than accelerated death as bankruptcy. The good news was that the prospects of the AE-96 had investors and investment banks claiming they easily could raise the money Codex needed. The phenomenal success of the IBM System/360, the promise of time-sharing and the growth of service bureaus, all contributed to an excitement for computers - and technology in general. And that kept investors salivating for the next great product opportunity. With the prospect that the stranglehold AT&amp;amp;T had on connecting to the telephone network might be ending, what would be a more perfect product than the highest speed modem?&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/3.6/Multiplexer-Innovation-American-Data-Systems-1966-1968/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The same dynamics that were driving the potential buying demand for modems were having a more immediate impact on multiplexers, the second great product of data communications. Multiplexers make it possible for many users to share the same communication channel at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplexers date to the days of the telegraph, and, although incrementally innovated over time, performed the same task as when first created: subdividing a communication channel into a larger number of channels. State-of-the-art in the early 1960’s were frequency division multiplexers (FDMs). Developed by the telephone and telegraph companies in the 1930’s and 1940’s, FDMs partitioned the frequency of an analog voice channel into multiple lower speed subchannels with each subchannel occupying a defined range of frequencies separated by frequency guard bands or safety zones.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc68&quot; href=&quot;#fn68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 3.6.1 Frequency Division Multiplexer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-361-frequency-division-multiplexer&quot;&gt;Exhibit 3.6.1 Frequency Division Multiplexer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/frequency-division-multiplexer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Frequency Division Multiplexer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for guard bands imposed a practical limit on the bandwidth of a FDM to 1800 bps to 2000 bps.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc69&quot; href=&quot;#fn69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; However, as computer terminals were particularly slow (75-150 bps), a large number of terminals could be supported by FDMs. FDMs did not require modems - another advantage. Even so, as the number of terminals that needed to be connected to computers increased, a new solution was needed - one to be innovated by a new start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Art Wilkes received an offer too good to pass up, and resigned from AT&amp;amp;T to work for his best customer, Scantlin Electronics (SE).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc70&quot; href=&quot;#fn70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; His job was to sell their newest FDM capable of connecting 150 terminals to one 2400 bps circuit.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc71&quot; href=&quot;#fn71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt; SE’s business of leasing on-line stock-quote terminals to brokerage firms and other financial organizations was booming and Wilkes had no problem getting them interested in the new FDM. Concurrently, Wilkes’ boss, Bob Schaaf, was writing a business plan to launch SE into the product business, presumably to sell their FDMs. Schaaf, however, surprisingly recommended selling a yet to be developed line of time division multiplexers (TDMs), a recommendation that was summarily rejected. Around this same time, late 1967, Wilkes was let go for not meeting sales quotas, despite the fact that the FDM did not work. Wilkes and Schaaf would strike deals leaving them free to pursue any ideas developed at SE in return for foregoing any owed compensation and stock options from the company. Immediately they began planning to start of a company selling the TDMs they would develop. In January 1967 they incorporated their new company: American Data Systems (ADS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time division multiplexers did away with the notion of frequency sub-channels inherent to FDMs and instead gave every connecting terminal, or device, a fixed time slot on a rotating basis. (See Exhibit 3.6.2 Time Division Multiplexer) The effect was to dramatically increase the number of terminals or devices that could be serviced by a factor of four, and with incremental innovation over time, by a factor of ten. TDMs, unlike FDMs, required modems for they needed a digital circuit made possible by modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-362-time-division-multiplexer&quot;&gt;Exhibit 3.6.2 Time Division Multiplexer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/time-division-multiplexer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Time Division Multiplexer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In need of someone to engineer and build some prototypes, Wilkes called his college roommate, William Norred, a site engineer with a technical support company for the Apollo moon program. Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was responsible for everything from sweeping the floors up through the storage of rocket propellants. Art called me one day and said: “I’m thinking about starting a company. Would you like to participate in it?” I said: ‘Yes. What are you going to do?’ He said: ‘We’re going to make modems and multiplexers,’ and I said: ‘What’s a modem? And what’s a multiplexer?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignorance did not deter Norred who readily said “Yes.” He and his wife gathered their few belongings, packed them into their car and, in February 1968, drove from Texas to California:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I arrived, Art told me that the money had fallen through. I said: ‘That’s fine. I’m moving in with you,’ and I actually lived in his den for a number of months. In fact, the first multiplexer was built in his garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred began building the TDM, while Wilkes and Schaaf searched for funding.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The sustained growth economy of the United States that began in the early 1950’s had neither the breadth nor legs to support the policies and actions of the Federal Government during the 1960’s. The simultaneous pursuit of both “guns and butter” – the Vietnam War and the “Great Society” – forced the Government to issue too much money. Perceived by a growing number of professional fund managers as a certain prescription for inflation, they sought new ways to increase their investment returns to offset the erosive potential of inflation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt; To earn higher returns required new investment strategies, one of which was to begin investing in stocks – the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE, or “Big Board”), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and National Quotation Bureau (later to become NASDAQ) – not solely dividend yield but for price appreciation,. Buying stocks for their growth potential turned into a stampede the day after President Lyndon B. Johnson’s State of the Union Message on January 10, 1967, when the third largest volume of shares traded in the then history of the Big Board changed hands. The day set-off a two-year bull market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most desired stocks were the “glamour” stocks or “Houdini issues:” IBM, Xerox, Polaroid and Kodak.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc73&quot; href=&quot;#fn73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt; Stock prices traded as high as fifty times next year’s projected earnings. Investor appetite and willingness to pay high prices for technology companies induced private technology companies to go public in order to raise always-needed cash and create desired liquidity for shareholders. Computer leasing companies proved an immediate favorite. By June/July 1967, investors actions resembled a “speculative orgy”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc74&quot; href=&quot;#fn74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt; according to Business Week with the AMEX up 50% and the NASDAQ up 40% – by August it would be up 70%. It seemed as if all a company had to do was embed “tronics” in its name, and it became a “high-flyer.” The markets peaked in September 1967, then regained momentum in the spring of 1968, opening another market window for technology companies, especially that were computer related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “hot” market for technology stocks induced the transformation of venture capital from largely an activity of wealthy families to one of professionally-managed fund partnerships.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc75&quot; href=&quot;#fn75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt; Investors, having made money on their private investments that went public, wanted to reinvest their capital gains in other new, private technology companies. The goal was to achieve ten to twenty times their investment in three to five years. A new breed of venture fund managers emerged in response. Unprecedented sums of money began flowing into venture capital. By 1970, the first year for which records were kept, $83 million was invested, up from maybe $10 million in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Their recently introduced 4400/48, priced at $5,885 each, proved to be the first reliable 4800 bps modem to work over unconditioned, or minimally conditioned, telephone lines.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc76&quot; href=&quot;#fn76&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt; The 4400/48 was an instant hit. Investment bankers began selling management on the idea of going public; the market for technology stocks that had been so hot through much of 1967 looked to be returning, and anything to do with computers was certain to generate buying interest. Needing cash to finance their growth, Milgo filed and went public in May 1968. Their timing could not have been better. In the first month of trading Milgo’s stock price doubled.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc77&quot; href=&quot;#fn77&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt; Then in August, Milgo signed an agreement with Racal Electronics, Limited (Racal), a United Kingdom corporation, to sell Milgo modems internationally, raising another $250,000.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc78&quot; href=&quot;#fn78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt; By October it had become clear that the data communication business needed to stand on its own, and a wholly-owned subsidiary, International Communications Corporation (ICC), was chartered with three percent of the stock distributed to employees.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc79&quot; href=&quot;#fn79&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt; (The convention will be to use Milgo, not ICC, as the corporation name, for eventually that was to become industry practice.) Modem sales for Milgo in 1968 would total $1.1 million, second only to AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Codex management, the “feeding frenzy” for the public stock of young technology companies continued into the fall of 1968. With promises for the future more important than current operating results, and with the performance of Milgo’s stock on record, Codex went public on December 23, 1968, raising $2.1 million, with a company post-money valuation of $12.5 million. The success of the offering rested entirely with the excitement generated by the revolutionary AE-96, not the low margin, unpredictable government R&amp;amp;D operations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc80&quot; href=&quot;#fn80&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt; Sales of $1.3 million for 1968, however, included no modem sales.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

The more people Wilkes and Schaaf talked to, the more they believed their window of opportunity would be brief if one believed all the rumors of competition.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In April 1967 the Carterfone hearings began. Since Carter was attacking the tariff prohibiting foreign attachments, the hearing was treated as a Complaint Proceeding with the involved parties arguing their case before an administrative law judge or Hearing Examiner, in this case, Chester F. Naumowicz, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernard Strassburg, Chairman of the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB), now convinced of the importance of computers and the need to encourage innovation and competition in telephone equipment, directed the CCB staff to argue before the Hearing Examiner that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the tariff was inherently unsound and should be declared unlawful, as unjust and unreasonable, and therefore unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCB then recommend the tariff be replaced with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;tariff provision that ‘clearly and affirmatively states…that customer-provided equipment, apparatus, circuits, or devices may be attached or connected to the telephones furnished by the telephone company in the message toll telephone service for any purpose that is privately beneficial to the customer and not publicly detrimental.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc81&quot; href=&quot;#fn81&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearings were over in just seven days. The parties now had to wait for Examiner Naumowicz’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the AT&amp;amp;T lawyers had argued in the Carterfone case as they had in the past, this philosophy no longer went unquestioned within AT&amp;amp;T. The change began when H. I. Romnes became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in early 1967. Romnes did not fully agree with AT&amp;amp;T’s long-standing policy opposing foreign attachments and stated publicly shortly after taking office that AT&amp;amp;T’s responsibility for the network could be maintained with the use of “suitable interfaces or buffer devices to keep the attached equipment from affecting other users of the network.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc82&quot; href=&quot;#fn82&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt; He also assembled a high-level Tariff Review Committee to conceive alternative interconnection tariffs that would protect the network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc83&quot; href=&quot;#fn83&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1967, Examiner Naumowicz issued his initial decision. Ignoring the CCB’s argument for a broad policy change, he ruled narrowly that harm from use of the Carterfone had not been proven: ”We here consider on a specific device and the evidence as to what, if any, effect it will have on the system.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc84&quot; href=&quot;#fn84&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that fall, responses to the FCC’s Notice of Inquiry began arriving. A sensitive nerve had been struck. An already burdened CCB saw thousands of pages of input and exhibits piling up. As CCB staffers began leafing through the materials, two subjects kept coming up again and again: the prohibition on foreign attachments was unduly restrictive, and telephone rate structures were designed for voice, not data, communications. Equally clear, the CCB had neither the resources nor expertise to make sense of the responses from fifty-five corporations. In early 1968, CCB contracted with the Stanford Research Institute, International (SRI), a think tank and consulting firm on the West Coast, to do the analysis. The SRI report, however, not expected until March 1969, would be upstaged by intervening events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 26, 1968, the FCC, in a surprising and unanimous decision, accepted the CCB’s recommendation and ruled that the tariff restrictions in Carterfone case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;are, and have since their inception been, unreasonable, unlawful, and unreasonably discriminatory under the Communications Act of 1934.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc85&quot; href=&quot;#fn85&quot;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission then concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The carriers may submit new tariffs which will protect the telephone system against harmful devices, and they may specify technical standards if they wish.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc86&quot; href=&quot;#fn86&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc87&quot; href=&quot;#fn87&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T responded:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc88&quot; href=&quot;#fn88&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have had the whole subject of connection of customer-owned devices in our network under intensive review for some time. Our intent is to be as responsive as possible to evolving communication needs through making our network available to expanding uses. At the same time, safeguards are essential to assure that other users of the network are not adversely affected.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc89&quot; href=&quot;#fn89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, Datamation, a leading trade journal, reported the FCC decision as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FCC dropped one shoe June 26 when it decided that Ma Bell’s foreign attachment restrictions are unnecessary, and unfair to users; last month, computer users and foreign attachment manufacturers were waiting for the other shoe to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experts familiar with the arcane world of communications utility regulation agreed that the next move was up to the carriers. As one lawyer put it: ‘the commission has blasted a gaping hole in the tariff wall, leaving the carriers dangerously exposed. At this moment, any user could hang any foreign attachment on his telephone line and not worry too much about getting arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added, however, that the user would be hurting himself as well as the telephone company. ‘The carriers lost largely because they couldn’t prove that foreign attachments were harmful. Almost certainly, they will now be looking doubly hard for such evidence in the hope of persuading a judge to overturn the commission’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ruling, if it stands, breaks the market for modems wide open, and provides a major opportunity for independent manufacturers in areas like touch-tone keyboards and picture-phone type units. There are no authoritative figures on the number of Western Electric’s modems in the dial-up network, but one manufacturer says that’s where 90% of the business is. Among data set suppliers are General Electric, which announced an extensive line late last year, Automatic Electric, Milgo, Rixon, Collins Radio, and Ultronic.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc90&quot; href=&quot;#fn90&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a press conference held in August, AT&amp;amp;T Board Chairman Romnes and President Ben Gilmer proposed a “newd ata access arrangement,” under which independently manufactured terminals could be coupled electrically, inductively, or acoustically to the public telephone system through a “protective device” and a “network controller.” The data communications user would pay to have the protective device installed, and a pay monthly rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1968, the FCC asserted its decision: devices that were privately beneficial without being publicly detrimental could be connected to the interstate telephone system.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc91&quot; href=&quot;#fn91&quot;&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Fall, Strassburg wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A decision by the Commission to relax the restrictions on the customer’s use of foreign attachments would expand the opportunity for wider participation in not only the computer equipment market, but in the communications equipment market generally.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc92&quot; href=&quot;#fn92&quot;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1968, AT&amp;amp;T filed new tariffs that far exceeded the expectations of the FCC. Customers would be allowed to directly connect terminal equipment to the public switched network provided they used an AT&amp;amp;T supplied protective connecting arrangement (PCA).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc93&quot; href=&quot;#fn93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 1.4 - AT&amp;amp;T Carterfone Tariff.) Strassburg later testified: “AT&amp;amp;T went well beyond the requirements of Carterfone.” The FCC ruled the new tariffs would become effective January 1, 1969.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc94&quot; href=&quot;#fn94&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

They consisted of a guarded AT&amp;amp;T, a handful of military contractors innovating modems, a few firms innovating FDMs, and an FCC seemingly satisfied with the course of events. Few would anticipate the wrenching changes following IBM’s introduction of the System/360 and the commercialization of time-sharing. The popularized vision of the Computer Utility captured the future of computing and highlighted the need computers had for access to and use of the telephone network. Decades of regulatory policy and AT&amp;amp;T intransigence could not stem the tides of technological change set in motion by computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1968 ended with real competition emerging in data communications. Milgo and Codex had innovated high-speed modems, revealing AT&amp;amp;T’s lack of commitment to advancing modem technology and products. A bullish stock market rewarded both company’s efforts and potential futures as they launched successful initial public offerings. American Data Systems would introduce the second-generation multiplexer, a TDM, and win a major contract from IBM. The imaginations and hopes of other entrepreneurs would be unleashed by the success of Milgo and Codex. Newly emerging venture capitalists awaited eagerly to invest in their dreams and soon new companies would be born,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even as the future of data communications seemed to be successfully unfolding, a small network of computer scientists, supported by the same IPTO office of ARPA that had funded time-sharing, began questioning whether computer networks really could be built of modems and multiplexers. The results of that questioning and the revolution leading to a radical paradigm shift comes next.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/4.0/Overview/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In October 1962, when Dr. J.C.R. Licklider became the first Director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), he already had a reputation as prompting leading-edge computer research. He advocated the development of time-sharing (many users using one computer at the same time) when computers of the day processed one task for one user at a time. Then in 1963 he proposed an even grander vision: an Intergalactic Network. Thousands of computers, millions of computers, interconnected so users on one computer could share information and work collaboratively with users on many other computers. Who would have ever imagined such a thought? Licklider did, and he did not hide it under a basket, but shared it with his colleagues. By dint of his energy, enthusiasm and ability to inspire and lead others, Licklider created a founding vision for computer communications, and momentum essential to this history took hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1965, two computer scientists influenced by Licklider, Dr. Lawrence G. (Larry) Roberts and Thomas Marill, conducted an experiment to understand what it would take to interconnect two computers. It highlighted the complexity of the problem, with the obvious conclusion that circuit switching -the way the telephone network worked - was a poor match for the needs of computer communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telephone network had been designed to meet the needs of voice communication. Someone hand-pecked a telephone number into an instrument, and the request traveled down a wire to a switch that checked to see if the connection could be made, and did so if it could. Then and only then could the two people talk. Many seconds, sometimes even minutes, elapsed with no one taking notice, being distracted with what they were going to say or an absent thought. To computers it was an eternity, even by the standards of the slowpoke computers of the day. But how else would one build a communication system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, in 1959, another computer scientist, Paul Baran, asked that very same question for different reasons. By 1962 he and others working with him had documented an alternative communication system, one based on exchanging small messages, not on making circuits. To most it seemed, well, absurd. Then in 1965, a British computer scientist, Dr. Donald Davies, proposed the very same idea. Roberts would return to the idea of a message-based communication system when he took on the responsibility of building a network for computers in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts had to sort out many questions, such as how would one build such a network or how would it work? There was no blueprint, no prior example to be improved upon. A few ideas, some money, not much, when combined with motivated, exceptional scientists, and a vision gave rise to the birth of computer networks. In mid-1968, a Request For Quotation was distributed to potential contractors inviting bids to build such a network.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/4.1/The-Intergalactic-Network-1962-1964/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When Dr. J. C. R. Licklider became Director of the IPTO (Information Processing Techniques Office) office of ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in October 1962, he had a vision of computing vastly grander than time-sharing. Yet knowing it would take all the resources and management he had at his disposal to implement the desired number of time-sharing projects, he decided to leave the issues of interconnecting the time-shared computers for the future. In April 1963, Licklider first described his over-arching vision of an “Intergalactic Network” in a memo to computer scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licklider remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term ‘Intergalactic Network’ was a kind of intentionally grandiloquent way to express the idea, because we didn’t really expect to get at that right away. It was all we could possibly do to make timesharing systems work.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licklider conceived a future of networked computers when few computers supported more than one user, and most people would have labored to conceive a future of thousands, let alone millions, of computers. It required a true soaring of the imagination to see end-user computing when the paradigm of the day was batch processing with users passing decks of computer cards to trained operators and sometimes having to wait days to receive their results, hardly interactive computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only for the self-effacing Licklider, computer networking came naturally. A gracious man with endless enthusiasm for new ideas and the will to implement them, Licklider’s career mirrored his innate gift for connecting with people. As a member of the Project Charles, an MIT summer study that advanced the need for an air defense system that became the genesis of the SAGE Project, he came into contact with some of the best science mangers of his time. He then taught at MIT and became a group leader at MIT’s Lincoln Labs, witnessing first hand the countless collaborations between these organizations, government agencies and commercial contractors. Throughout this period Licklider’s insatiable quest for new ideas brought him into contact with the finest computer scientists of his day. When in 1957, he left MIT to join Bolt Beranek and Newnan, he would rely on this network of talented individuals to assemble an exceptional staff. In creating an environment of unbridled energy for exploring how computers could be made more ubiquitous and useable, he advanced the state of many basic ideas, especially time-sharing. Mining this milieu, he made the fantastic leap that guaranteed that the future of computing would evolve into a gigantic network: an Intergalactic Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at IPTO, Licklider again drew upon his network of individuals as well as a number of forward-thinking corporations to bring this grand new world into being. For the most part he was successful, but not always. When he invited the participation of AT&amp;amp;T and its Bell Labs, he generated little more than personal frustration. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The telephone company wasn’t interested. Well, Buick used to have the expression: ‘When the better cars are built, Buick will build them.’ I have a feeling the telephone company felt: ‘When there’s a time for networks, we’ll know about it.’&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1964, after only two years, Licklider left IPTO for IBM to assume a role he later described as more promoter than scientist or researcher. In September, Dr, Ivan Sutherland, a young prescient computer scientist and a member of Licklider’s network, took over as the new Director of IPTO. One of his first, and easiest, decisions was to fund the work of his friend Dr. Lawrence G. (Larry) Roberts, a principal investigator at Lincoln Labs. Roberts informally led the group Wes Clark once headed; the same Clark who had earlier so influenced Licklider. Roberts, who was to become one of the giants of computer communications, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nobody knew what anybody should be doing with the computer. The TX-2 was really a tremendous machine. When Ivan went to ARPA, we worked together to supply money to the group, and as a result, I wound up being in charge as the contract monitor for ARPA, but on no formal terms at Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and Sutherland had known each other since entering the MIT doctoral program in 1959. They quickly became friends, sharing both an office and a passion for computer graphics. When preparing their computer demonstrations to complete their degree requirements, they used the TX-2 computer at Lincoln Labs on alternate nights. (In their final exams, each demonstrated algorithms that become seminal in computer graphics.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1964, Licklider, Sutherland and Roberts were among a contingent of ARPA scientists traveling by train to Hot Springs, Virginia, to attend the Second Congress of the Information System Sciences sponsored by MITRE Corporation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; The trip afforded the scientists the rare opportunity to interact as a group and they crammed every minute with conversations later characterized by Licklider as intense and spirited. When the trip began Roberts had at best a modest interest in computer communications. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t have any strong direction at that point, or before that point. Lick was arguing for the ‘Intergalactic Network’ concept. Lick and I and a number of other people talked at the conference about what the next thing would be, and I concluded that the thing to work on would be the communications between computers and to computers, because the computer stuff itself was a big team activity at that point, and one that I thought I knew how to handle anyway. The real challenging task was to try to interlink these systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

In February 1965, Sutherland turned to his friend Roberts, who always had the time and energy to tackle something new, and authorized Roberts to proceed with an experiment to study how to interconnect computers. In July, Roberts contracted with Thomas Marill, founder of the time-sharing company, Computer Corporation of America (CCA), to devise a network experiment. Marill, a former student of Licklider’s, took the project on largely because he too was motivated by Licklider’s Intergalactic Network vision. In October 1965, Roberts and Marill connected a TX-2 computer at MIT Lincoln Lab with a Q-32 computer at System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, CA using a lease-line from Western Union.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The simple yet path-breaking experiment proved that the computers could run programs and retrieve data on the remote machines, but that the circuit-switched telephone system presented problems. Roberts remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And what we found is that you can connect the computers fine internally and the time-sharing systems both could call on each other, but the communications was slow and unreliable and difficult – and made the whole process so slow it wasn’t very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the telephone network proved unattractive as a communication system posed a very significant problem, because other than the totally unsuitable telegraph system, the telephone system was the only nation-wide communication system in existence at the time.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In January 1878, the first telephone switch went into operation in New Haven Connecticut. Switching technology had advanced drastically over the intervening decades, yet the basic function had remained the same: interconnect users of telephones by creating circuits between them. Every telephone has a line, or circuit, that connects physically to a telephone switch. In the simple case of both the person making the call and the person being called are connected to the same switch, the caller dials the number of the desired person, the switch checks to see if the line is available, and if it is, the two lines are interconnected by the switch. The connection is maintained until one person hangs up his or her telephone, at which time the switch terminates the connection, freeing both lines for other calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three characteristics of this type of switching, called “circuit switching,” are important. First, before the two parties can talk the circuit between them has to be created, and it takes time for a switch to check if a connection can be made and then to make the connection. Second, when a connection has been made, it creates a dedicated connection. No other party can reach either party of a dedicated connection until that connection has ended. Three, since switches are very expensive one accounting policy telephone companies implemented to recover their investment was to institute a minimum charge for every telephone call, generally three minutes. For voice calls that lasted many minutes, a minimum charge did not represent a problem. But communications between computers often last less than seconds, much less minutes. It was difficult to image how circuit switching could work efficiently for computer communications when such a system took minutes to make a connection, created dedicated connections so only one person, or party, could be in connection with another party, and had a prohibitive cost structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these issues were generally understood before the experiments of Roberts and Marill in 1965, they were once again strongly confirmed. The experiments also made it abundantly clear that the problems confronting computer communications were not only with the circuit-switching architecture of the telephone system. Host operating system software of the day assumed there was only one Host and all connecting devices were as if “slaves.” Hosts were not designed to recognize or interact with peer-level computers; the concept of peer-level computing did not yet exist. Thus, in interconnecting two computers, one had to be master and one slave. The problem only became worse if more than two computers wanted to interconnect and communicate. Nevertheless, the problem of Host software was considered to be solvable if a suitable communication system could be designed and made to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, an inquisitive innovative scientist, Paul Baran, had already explored the problems of circuit switching beginning in 1959. By 1962, he had made his concept of a message-based communication system publicly known. Independently, in 1965, an English scientist, Donald Davies reached the same conclusions as had Baran and would coin its name: packet switching.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/4.4/Paul-Baran-1959-1965/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Paul Baran exemplifies the principal that if one must work, find something really important to work on. Ever exuding a quiet, even polite, intensity that speaks of someone who is confident of what he is thinking, by 1959, just ten years out of college, Baran already had discovered the problem he wanted to work on. Baran wanted to prevent a nuclear holocaust, not for money or fame, but from personal angst. After graduating from Drexel Institute of Technology, he went to work for the computer start-up Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company before moving on to Raymond Rosen Engineering Products. A few years later, he moved to California and landed a job with Hughes Aircraft as a junior engineer on the Minuteman missile control system. These experiences proved important training in digital design and implementation. While at Hughes, he attended UCLA graduate school at night where he earned his master’s degree in engineering. Baran then joined RAND where he dedicated himself to solving the problem of nuclear missile command and control. At the time, he had absolutely no concept of a solution or that his solution one day would be seminal to a global communications revolution destined to transform human society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAND, short for “research and development, “is a unique organization. Created at the end of World War II to preserve the operations research capability developed by the Air Force during the war, it first found home tucked under the protective wing of Douglas Aircraft Corporation in California However, a research organization managed by a manufacturing organization proved an uncomfortable fit. To secure its autonomy, the Ford Foundation advanced seed money to convert RAND into an independent, non-profit research organization chartered to work on problems of national security. Being a true think tank, it never implemented ideas developed by its staff, but left them for other organizations to pursue. An exception came early, when MIT Lincoln Labs subcontracted computer programming for the SAGE project to RAND. In two short years, RAND would divest the effort to a specially created organization funded by the Air Force: Systems Development Corporation, better know as SDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way the Air Force made RAND researchers aware of its needs was to distribute a weekly list of requests for study.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Baran, in search of a project, reviewed the weekly postings and his interest was soon sparked by a project concerning the survivability of the military’s strategic command and control system. Baran made a proposal, which was accepted, and he began by studying the survivability of the AT&amp;amp;T telephone network – the communication system the Air Force depended on. He concluded it was a disaster: a few well-placed bombs could disrupt communications throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran had found his focus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How to build a robust communications network that could survive an attack and allow the remainder of the network to behave as a single coordinated entity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s telephone network vulnerability came from its highly centralized design. At the time, networks were either centralized or decentralized. In centralized networks, all end points (nodes) connect to one central switching point. In decentralized networks, clusters of smaller centralized networks are interconnected to form one large network, thus eliminating a single point of system failure. (See Exhibit 2.0 Centralized and Decentralized Networks.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran then looked to see if more robust networks could be constructed than decentralized ones. In his investigations, he was strongly influenced by his understanding of how the brain worked. He had numerous interactions with Warren McCullough of MIT, an influential cognitive scientist. Inspired, Baran examined networks in which every node connected to every other node – a distributed network, but found little if any research on the subject. (See Exhibit 4.1 Distributed Network.) To discover how distributed networks behaved under disruptions, Baran modeled various configurations and simulated attacks against the network. He concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A critical mass of the structure occurred when a network reached about 15 to 20 nodes in width and used a redundancy level of about three times as many links as the minimum needed to tie all the nodes together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-440-centralized-decentralized--distributed-networks&quot;&gt;Exhibit 4.4.0 Centralized, Decentralized &amp;amp; Distributed Networks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_4.4.0_Centralized_vs_Distributed_Networks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of Centralized, Decentralized &amp;amp; Distributed Networks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to how to build such a network, Baran recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Having figured out how to get robustness, I then had to tackle the problem of getting signals through this fishnet type of network. Analog signals deteriorate rapidly when you have many links in tandem. Therefore, I concluded that all communications would have to be digital to maintain signal quality. I initially thought in terms of ‘minimal essential communications.’ I proposed to relay teletype signals from one AM broadcast station to another, building on an idea earlier proposed by Frank Collbohm, the President of RAND Corporation. (Unlike skywave HF transmissions, AM broadcast ground wave signals did not depend on the ionosphere for propagation.) The limitation of Colbohm’s idea was that there was no intelligence to relay signals. I proposed merely to flood the network where subsequent messages wash out the older messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran presented his solution to the Air Force. He was told that while his proposal might take care of the President, the Air Force and other military branches also needed a system with a lot more capacity to communicate with field personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1962, Baran presented a paper titled: On Distributed Communications Networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; In it, he proposed the radical computer communication concept of standard message blocks routed as “hot potatoes” in a store-and-forward system. He would write:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In communications, as in transportation, it is most economic for many users to share a common resource rather than each to build his own system, particularly when supplying intermittent or occasional service. This intermittency of service is highly characteristic of digital communication requirements. Therefore, we would like to consider one day the interconnection, of many all- digital links to provide a resource optimized for the handling of data of many potential intermittent users: a new common-user system. Present common carrier communications networks, used for digital transmission, use links and concepts originally designed for another purpose - voice. These systems are built around a frequency division multiplexing link-to-link interface standard. The standard between links is that of data rate. Time division multiplexing appears so natural to data transmission that we might wish to consider an alternative approach, a standardized message block as a network interface standard. While a standardized message block is common in many computer-communications applications, no serious attempt has ever been made to use it as a universal standard.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to how the messages will be passed, Baran creatively proposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Torn-tape telegraph repeater stations and our mail system provide examples of conventional store-and-forward switching systems. In these systems, messages are relayed from station to station and stacked until the “best” outgoing link is free. The key feature of store-and-forward transmission is that it allows a high line occupancy factor by storing so many messages at each node that there is a backlog of traffic awaiting transmission. But the price for link efficiency is the price paid in storage capacity and time delay. However, it was found that most of the advantages of store-and-forward switching could be obtained with extremely little storage at the nodes. Thus, in the system to be described, each node will attempt to get rid of its messages by choosing alternate routes if its preferred route is busy or destroyed. Each message is regarded as a “hot potato,” and rather than hold the hot potato, the node tosses the message to its neighbor who will now try to get rid of the message.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran began presenting his ideas to others. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I conducted probably 40 or more briefings around the country on my research throughout government and to major research organizations. Many who were proficient in computer technology felt the concepts to be viable. Those who were familiar only with conventional analog transmission had the most difficulty. AT&amp;amp;T that held the monopoly for telecommunications at the time was among the most negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran submitted his seminal paper to the “IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems” in October 1963 and it was published in March 1964. In August 1964, RAND Corporation published “On Distributed Communications,” Vols. I through XI by Baran with Sharla Boehm co-authoring Volume II and J. W. Smith authoring Volume III. These volumes set forth the concepts of how communication networks could be designed as a message-based, distributed system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it remained only an idea. To really see if it worked, a message-based system needed to be built. In 1965, the opportunity seemed to present itself. Baran remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1965, a formal RAND Recommendation was made to the Air Force to implement my plan. The Air Force had the not-for-profit MITRE Corporation organize a committee to review the subject in detail. The recommendation of the committee was to immediately proceed. Then came one of those brilliant strokes of higher-level management. The Department of Defense ruled that the agency that should be building the system was the Defense Communications Agency, not the Air Force, since it would be used by more than one service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the composition of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) – personnel with no computer or digital experience, exactly those who had proved most skeptical and negative to these new ideas – Baran recommended the project be shelved, arguing it was better to wait for the right group to manage its creation.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1965, Donald Davies, Deputy Superintendent of the Autonomics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), London, attended an International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Congress meeting in New York City. The IFIP meeting started Davies down a path of discovery that would lead to the same conclusions as Baran, although with special twists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the future seemed to be time-sharing and the most influential project was Project MAC of MIT. On the suggestion of a colleague, Davies arranged a seminar at the NPL in London on November 2 and 3 with scientists from MIT to discuss Project MAC. Larry Roberts attended. Davies remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were talking not so much about communications, but about the concept of time-sharing and how it affects the way you do computing and all sorts of things. The communications aspects had interested me, because I had a history of interest in telephone switching and things like that. Nothing very much in detail was said at that meeting about solutions to the problem, but several people said how difficult it was: how you could get hour-long telephone calls in which not very much data was transmitted; what you could do about making communications more efficient and so on. During the meeting, I went over and thought about this, and it seemed to me that since the actual data rate was very variable, which is to say a few bits would pass over and then there’d be a long pause and so on, and I thought rather than opening a bandwidth for the whole time, it was sensible to treat the information in terms of short messages and simply transmit these by store-and-forward methods from one place to another. I simply sat down and did a few samples on the back of an envelope, literally, to see how this would work out. My first thought was that if you had to store messages and transmit them, there must be a delay, and this might defeat the whole purpose of the thing, which was to have rapid communications. It soon became obvious that this wasn’t so, and that if you chose fairly high data rates, by the standards of the day, and fairly short messages, the storage time was so short that it didn’t really affect your communications. Simple idea. I began to work this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, November 10, 1965, Davies wrote a short paper titled: “Remote On-line Data Processing and its Communication Needs.” He concluded that the delays inherent in a store-and-forward system did not need to conflict with the objective of instantaneous communications, as long as the line speed was at least 10,000 bps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davies, like Baran five years earlier, brought to the problem a background in digital technology. Having experience with the earliest stored-program computers (1947-1951), Davies instinctively turned to the same “message block” solution formulated by Baran. To Davies, it was an obvious solution to the mismatch between the “voice” telephone circuit and the needs of time-sharing. In his words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of effort in time sharing systems had gone into avoiding the waste of the computer’s time while it waited on the user, the thinking time, but the telephone network’s contribution to the cost had been ignored. Essentially, the communication network gave the user transmission capacity while the computer dealt in blocks of information, mostly in short units. This was the mismatch that set me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 8, Davies circulated an eight-page paper entitled “Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-Line Data Processing” to individuals within the telephone company (then the British Post Office) and others known to be interested in telecommunications. Davies remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few comments came back, none destructive, but none very enthusiastic. The most common remarks were that it was only message switching, which was understood, or that it would be fine, but nobody could build the necessary ‘message switches.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encountering no strong opposition, Davies continued work by attaching the Proposal to a research program called ‘programming research’ in order to avoid attracting too much attention.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 16, 1966, Davies gave a public lecture titled: “The Future Digital Communication Network.” Typically twenty to thirty people attended such talks. A standing room only crowd of at least a hundred and twenty people showed up, mostly from the British Post Office and various telecommunications manufacturers. In the spirited discussion that followed, a few people from the Post Office proved especially negative, and would form a nucleus of opposition to Davies’s proposal to build a message-based experimental network for the Post Office (just as Licklider had been frustrated by the monopolist AT&amp;amp;T in the United States). Davies’ lecture was published in June 1966 as a 25-page report titled “Proposal for a Digital Communications Network.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his report, Davies used the word “packet” for the first time to refer to the messages circulating over the network. He had given this the new network architecture the name that would stick: “packet switching. “&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Packet switching represented a paradigm shift in communications technology. A paradigm shift that in combination with the digital revolution would, and has continued to, transform not only the nature of computer communications but communications of every kind, including voice. But few could have imagined such implications in 1966. There had to be working proof that a communication system could be architected based on a technology different than creating circuits; that in some as of then undiscovered manner, messages or packets might simply be launched into a communication network and be delivered error-free to their destination. That first working proof on a scale that could not be dismissed was the Arpanet, a story to be told shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran and Davies both had training and experience that enabled them to intuit the implications of digital transmission for “intermittent” or “short messages.” The coming digital transmission circuits would be so much faster than the then existing analog circuits that the carrying capacity, or bandwidth, of the digital circuits would accommodate many users or messages at the same time. Making those implications even more dramatic was the burst-like and asynchronous nature of computer communications. Users frequently transmitted short messages in request for information, or in response to requests, with responses often being much longer messages. Furthermore, humans take time to respond, whether in thought or physical dexterity, whereas computers perform as if instant in comparison. These differences between computer and voice communications were not new to the computer scientists drawn to revolutionizing computer communications, for many of them had intimate knowledge designing and coding operating systems for computers, systems that communicated by passing messages. So what had been new to Baran and Davies had become common knowledge to those who would design and construct the Arpanet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packet switching as in the sending and receiving of packets might have been an obvious alternative to circuit switching, but exactly how to build such a system remained unclear. Hundreds of questions and concerns remained, such as how would the messages between computers be parsed into the presumably fixed length packets that would circulate within the communication network? Then how would the packets be reassembled into the original messages, especially if the packets arrived out of order? How would packets be buffered in the store-and-forward switches if the transmission possibilities were unavailable and the switches became overloaded? What about congestion, or error-correction, and so on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the purity of packet switching came into question for there were compelling reasons for creating circuits between communication parties. Was there a combination of the use of circuits and of packets that might be optimal? Such as users, or programs, interacting with the system as if circuits were being created and yet the communication network functioning as if simply passing packets? This concept, that of virtual circuits, not real or physical circuits, but virtual circuits being created to better effect communications would become important albeit not at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution of how to build large, multiple networks of computers will not be fully demonstrated until 1988 and, even then, the solutions that would be thought to dominate would with time change. But the world of future computer communications, future as in looking forward from 1965, would never have become what it will without the profound impact of packet switching.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/4.7/Planning-the-ARPANET-1967-1968/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Robert (Bob) W. Taylor succeeded Sutherland as Director of the IPTO. Taylor completely subscribed to Licklider’s vision of an Intergalactic Network. Furthermore, he faced the essence of the problem every day in his office: he had three different computer terminals because he needed access to three different computers. Taylor remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By late ‘65, early ‘66, there were a number of ARPA sponsored research groups that had built for themselves, and were using in their own work, some of the first time-sharing systems. So, it occurred to me, sort of taking off from this tongue and cheek ‘Intergalactic Network’ phrase of Licklider’s, that the next thing to do was obvious, and that is – if we had singular communities who could interactively communicate through a time-sharing system that they were all members of, why couldn’t we have clusters of communities interact, members of one community could interact with members of another community, as though they might be sharing a single time-sharing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1966, influenced by the experiments conducted by Roberts and Marill at Lincoln Labs, Taylor decided the time had come for ARPA to focus on interconnecting existing, and planned, time-sharing systems into an ARPA scientific community. Not having the money to launch a new project, he approached Charles Hertzfeld, Director of ARPA.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; He remembers explaining to Hertzfeld:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are certain experts in certain fields who sit in California, and there are other experts in that same field who sit in Massachusetts or someplace else, and if we can make this work, we can have a medium through which they can work cooperatively, and so we get amplification of ideas. Another advantage of tackling this problem is that we might be able to achieve some fail-soft characteristics in any collection of computing that the Defense Department would especially be interested in.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that discussion probably lasted 15 minutes, and he immediately was excited about it, and he said: ‘You’ve got the money. How much do you need to get started?’  I gave him a number, and he pulled it out of another one of his ARPA projects, and said: ‘Go.’“&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor next needed a program manager. His first choice was Roberts. Roberts, however, wanted nothing to do with becoming a program manager or of moving to Washington. Unable to think of anyone as qualified as Roberts, Taylor kept asking and Roberts kept declining. Taylor remembers the ruse that won the day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In September or October of ‘66, it dawned on me that ARPA supported 51%, or thereabouts, of all of Lincoln Lab’s work. So I went to see Hertzfeld and I said: ‘Charley, is it still true that ARPA supports 51% or more of Lincoln Lab,’ and he said: ‘Yeah.’ I said: ‘Well, you know this network project that I’m trying to get off the ground?’ He said: ‘Yeah.’ I said: ‘Well, there’s a guy at Lincoln Lab that I want to be the program manager for it and I can’t get him to come down here. His name is Larry Roberts. I’d like for you to call the Director of Lincoln Lab and tell him that it would be in Lincoln Lab’s best interest and Larry Roberts’ best interest if the Director of Lincoln Lab encouraged Larry Roberts to come down to Washington and be the program manger for this project.’ Charley said: ‘Sure,’ and he picked up the phone with me in his office, and he called the Director of Lincoln Lab and had a short conversation and he hung up the phone, and about a month later Larry accepted the job. In Christmas of that year, he came down with his family and they stayed at my house over the holidays because they didn’t have a place to live yet. I blackmailed him into fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Roberts aboard as program manager, Taylor began visiting various ARPA contractors, explaining the purpose of the network in an effort to generate support. Not wanting to give others access to their computers, most of the contractors resisted the concept. It became very clear that the challenge of bringing into being the world’s first computer communication system would involve more than just technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his legendary intensity, Roberts tackled the challenges of bringing into being a network to interconnect the ARPA community. To him, the concept of communications by exchanging messages or packets seemed neither strange nor novel. It was simply a logical extension of how computers communicated internally – exchanging blocks of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts remembers the beginnings of building a computer network:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of us in computing were clearly not going to go after it on a circuit switched basis. We were all thinking in blocks. That’s the way computers worked. So we approached it very differently than the communications people. We thought in terms of: “How can we do this such that it will be a functionally useful service for the computers?” I got together groups and committees of the ARPA people and started working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He first focused on how to build a packet network; fully realizing that there also existed the challenge of how computers would communicate across the intended peer-like network, and that the two were dependent, locked in some unseen co-evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After numerous conversations, Roberts concluded his first major decision had to be the network topology: how to link the computers together. A topology of interconnecting every computer to every other computer didn’t make sense, based on the results of his experiment at Lincoln Labs and the absurdity of projecting hundreds of computers all interconnected to each other. The number of connections would explode as the square of the number of computers. A shared network, however, entailed solving the problem of switching when using a packet, or message block, architecture. To explore the questions of packet size and contents, Roberts requested Frank Westervelt of the University of Michigan write a position paper on the intercomputer communication protocol including  “conventions for character and block transmission, error checking and re transmission, and computer and user identification.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two alternative architectures for a shared network emerged: a star topology or a distributed message switched system. A star topology, or centralized network, would have one large central switch to which every computer was connected. It represented the least development risk because it was well understood. However, it was also known to perform poorly given lots of small messages – the precise condition of packet messaging. On the other hand, a distributed message switching system as proposed by Baran and Davies, had never been built, but held the theoretical advantage of performing best given lots of small messages.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; With a choice needing to be made, the upcoming annual meeting of ARPA contractors seemed an ideal time to air the issues and reach a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Clark remembers the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the meeting it became clear to me what the problem was. So I slipped a note to Taylor stating ‘I know what to do.’ Taylor probably didn’t look at my message until after the meeting. It was fairly obvious to me to put the communication functions in a separate, smaller computer outside the computer ‘network.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, Taylor, Roberts, Clark and Dave Evans shared a taxi to the airport and discussed the network topology decision. Taylor remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Larry, prior to this taxi ride, was thinking of a network controller in a centralized sense; something in the center of the country, a large machine, that would control the network, and I was nervous about that. I talked to Licklider and to Wes about it, separately, and Larry wasn’t irrevocably wedded to the idea, but that was his model at the time. In the cab to the airport after this meeting, I got Wes talking about it. Whether he had sorted it all out prior to that cab ride or whether he sorted it out based spontaneously in the conversation in that cab, I don’t know. But he said:  “Why have a central control.  Why not have small machines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it was fairly obvious. I think somebody else would have come to it with a little more time. Let those little computers talk to one another and serve as terminals to which the big machines would talk. In a sense, that took the big machines outside the network. The concept up to that point was that the network was the big machines plus all the interconnections, and my sudden realization at the meeting was that you wanted the machines outside the network, not inside it. Larry or Bob asked me how to get these little small computers built and I said I thought there was only one person who could do that job in the country, namely Frank Heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, Roberts and his staff studied Clark’s suggestion and concluded that the idea of a separate computer located at each site handling the network functions was an ingenious solution. In addition to its technical merits, it allowed the network to be designed and built independently of host computer hardware and software, greatly simplifying project management. The small computers, to be called interface message processors (IMP’s), together with the telephone lines and the modems would constitute the message-switching, communications network, or “Subnet” (or subnet.) (See Diagram 4.7.0 The Subnet and Hosts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagram-470-the-subnet-and-hosts&quot;&gt;Diagram 4.7.0 The Subnet and Hosts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_4.7.0_Arpanet_subnet.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Arpanet subnet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts understood a deep and important dilemma of the emerging network. Computers wanted to communicate in message sizes very much larger than ideal for a packet network. This meant an IMP would receive a message from its Host computer that it would have to parse into packets that in turn would traverse the subnet. The packets would then have to be reassembled into the message before being usable by the Host and, most likely, even before being delivered to the Host. Realistically, that implied that the IMPs would have to store packets before forwarding them.  Such a network had never been designed, much less built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of us thought, clearly, in those days, about computer switching rather than circuit switching; some sort of computerized switching.  You got the traffic in and you put it out.  It could have been that we put it out block for block as fast as it came in; it could have been that we stored the whole message and forwarded it. What we concluded was that you wanted to not store the whole message and forward it, and you couldn’t have a perfect virtual cut-through where you sent every block immediately synchronously because it might interfere with the next message. So you had to do it in some smaller breakdown, which is like a packet, or whatever, which, of course, is the size lump you’re in anyway, because you’ve got to put sum checks on it every interval. So, there wasn’t any question about packets – and clearly Donald gave it the name – that we had to be in that sort of size. Now and then, each one of us in the world would derive what length that ought to be ultimately for sum check, because of errors, and that was around the thousand-bit area then, with error rates that were in existence then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts sought help from Leonard Kleinrock his former officemate from MIT, now on the faculty of UCLA.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;   Even though Kleinrock was not working on network queuing theory at the time, in his Ph.D. thesis, he had shown that a large store-and-forward could work, despite the delays introduced by store-and forward. In 1964, Dover Publications had published his thesis as a book; the same year RAND had published Baran’s work. Kleinrock reflects, saying the ideas in “Communication Nets: Stochastic Message Flow and Delay” “lay fallow in the scientific literature because it was, in some sense, before it’s time. Nobody believed these networks could be built. It drew upon ideas from classical military communications networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, Roberts was also coming to the opinion that a limited experiment would not be very meaningful: a network of many nodes had to be created if the network was going to be useful for serious purposes. But that introduced the problem of how to convince that many more potential computer sites to devote the resources to the network, as opposed to their existing priorities. Licklider comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have the strong impression that Larry thought there was no little experiment that would be very helpful; that he had to have a network with many nodes – a dozen anyway and probably 100 – and that it had to be used for serious purposes, and that his problem was – what he had to excel at as a manager was actually getting this whole ARPA community to make ten or fifteen percent of everybody’s effort to get the network to go. He though he was in a good position, that he had not only the people who could build it, but enough people to use it, if he could only get them really focused and interested. I believe I was director of Project MAC at that time, and I loved the network. I had trouble with my people about it. They didn’t like it, but I said: “I estimate as a minimum, ten percent of our effort is going to be the network. It’ll just happen that way,” and partly that was promotion on my part and partly it was true belief, but most of the others were much more interested in what they were doing than Larry’s network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Taylor began giving more responsibilities to Roberts, hoping that Roberts would succeed him as director of IPTO. It meant Roberts had less and less time for the network project. To compensate, Roberts recruited Barry Wessler from the University of Utah to be his assistant. (Wessler would not actually join IPTO until early 1968.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in another important community event that caused historical course-corrections, came the ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles in Gatlinburg, TN, October 1-4, 1967. Roberts presented a paper: “Multiple Computer Networks and Intercomputer Communications.” In it he lamented the deficiencies of dial-up telephone circuits, yet nevertheless concluded that the communication links between IMPs would be 2400 bit/second dial-up circuits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; That constraint would not last very long, however, for another speaker, Roger Scantlebury, presented a paper authored by Davies, Bartlett, Scantlebury and Wilkinson, describing a local network being developed at NPL based on Davies’ ideas and employing much higher speed circuits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; (On returning to the U. K. after the Gatlinburg conference, Scantlebury reported: “It would appear then that the ideas in the NPL paper at the moment are more advanced than any proposed in the USA”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts took the findings of the NPL team seriously, later describing how they influenced his thinking: “The NPL paper clearly impacted the ARPANET in several ways. The name “packet” was adopted, a much higher speed was selected (50 Kilobit/second vs 2.4 Kilobit/second) for internode lines to reduce delay and generally the NPL analysis helped confirm the concept of packet switching.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at Gatlinburg, Roberts and Baran finally found time to talk. Roberts remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The RAND work was very detailed, since it covered the whole network including microwave and one valuable analysis on routing. The hot potato routing algorithm was a useful starting point for the ARPANET routing design.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;After the Gatlinburg conference, Roberts began writing the Request for Quotation (RFQ), the document prospective contractors would use to bid building the network. He also began devoting more time to selling the network to ARPA contractors, all of whom were stretched thin for resources and were disinclined to reallocate ten to fifteen percent of their budgets to a network project, especially since it would give others access to their coveted computer(s). For those sites not willing to cooperate, Roberts held the ultimate source of persuasion and was willing to exercise his power if needed. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we just convinced them all they weren’t going to get any computer funding anymore unless they cooperated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone needed to be convinced of a network’s potential benefits. In an article published in Science &amp;amp; Technology in April 1968, Licklider and Taylor wrote of a future day “when people of similar interests will work with each other through a network of computers – even when they are in the same room.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; Later in the article, they predicted: “What will on-line interactive communities be like? In most fields they will consist of geographically separated members, sometimes grouped in small clusters and sometimes working individually. They will be communities not of common location, but of common interest. In each field, the overall community of interest will be large enough to support a comprehensive system of field-oriented programs and data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might be a vision of the future, but the challenges of the present were much more modest. When distributed in July 1968, the Request for Quotation (RFQ) specified a four-node network with the potential to be expanded to 35 sites. The first nodes would be UCLA, SRI, UCSB and the University of Utah. UCLA would be installed in September 1969 with successive sites to be added monthly. (See Diagram 2.3 Initial Arpanet.) The minicomputer-based IMP’s were to be interconnected by 50 kilobit/second leased lines. The network transport mechanism was to be packets, but the IMPs would communicate with the Host computers using messages. Messages could be roughly eight times the size of a packet; hence, an average message would be parsed into eight packets. The RFQ outlined what the network was supposed to do, both structurally and functionally, without specifying how to do it. It would be the responsibility of the winning contractor to mold the concepts in the RFQ into a working system. Clearly it was hoped that some of the uncertainty of the design would be clarified in the responses to the RFQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagram-480-initial-arpanet&quot;&gt;Diagram 4.8.0 Initial Arpanet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_4.8.0_Arpanet_first_4_nodes.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Arpanet - first 4 nodes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve firms responded to the RFQ. IBM, the largest computer company, did not respond, despite Licklider’s past evangelizing. Neither did AT&amp;amp;T bid. Four contenders held supplementary technical briefings and final negotiations were conducted between two finalists: Raytheon, and Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When ARPA released the RFQ in July 1968, BBN had assigned the responsibility of preparing its response to Frank Heart, the head of Division 6. Heart had extensive experience with computer communications including work on the SAGE system at Lincoln Labs. Heart also enjoyed personal relationships with many of the ARPA personnel, including Roberts. After the Michigan meeting in 1967, Clark had recommended Heart to Taylor as the one person who could connect the computers together without relying on a central computer to direct the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart recalls attaching no special importance to the project:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one realized at this stage how big it was to be. After all, it was just to build a four-node network. We did not know it was going to start a revolution!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart’s core team was made up of former Lincoln Labs employees who had followed him to BBN: Severo Ornstein, who had once worked for Wesley Clark, had responsibility for the hardware design; Will Crowther was the principal software designer; and Dave Walden worked for Crowther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Kahn, another key contributor, was loaned to the team from BBN Division 4, the division responsible for time-sharing and computer research. A man of inexhaustible energy, Kahn served as a member of the technical staff of AT&amp;amp;T’s Bell Labs while a graduate student at Princeton University. After completing his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1964, Kahn joined the faculty of MIT. In 1966 he left MIT to become a member of Division 4 at BBN where he reported to Jerry Elkind. Elkind encouraged Kahn to pursue networking projects and had already introduced Kahn and Roberts. Elkind believed designing a computer network was of national importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart remembers the importance of his team’s shared experiences building real-time computer systems at Lincoln Labs, including the influence of SAGE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The whole SAGE system, of course, was built on computers communicating with each other and with radar sets. So that was a well-mined area in terms of the simple technology of using modems and connecting data sources to computers. At that time, very few people understood how to build real-time computer systems. That was one of the things that the people who worked at Lincoln had learned, that when you’re building radar systems, or the SAGE system, or systems to handle seismic data, or radio telescope data, performance was very critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing included more than experience, it included the knowledge and systems to manage into being risky, existence-proof technical systems. Roberts, himself having thrived at Lincoln Labs, did not ignore the advantages of working with others so trained. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Raytheon had a good proposal that competed equally with BBN, and the only distinguishing thing in the long run for my final decision was that BBN had a tighter team organized in a way that I thought would be more effective than a very steep commercial structure with lots of managers and vertically – so I didn’t believe they’d keep the schedules as well, but they had a good proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week before Christmas 1968, BBN learned it had won the ARPA contract. While pleased, the team knew the real work now began. There was one light moment: before receiving their formal notification, Senator Edward Kennedy telegramed BBN, congratulating them on having won the “Interfaith Message Processor Project.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Licklider’s vision of an Intergalactic Network would finally be launched in the contract let by Roberts at IPTO at the end of 1968. The Project would become known as Arpanet: a network created by ARPA. It would revolutionize how computers would communicate with each other and, in doing so, would unleash unimagined change, technological, economic, social, and human. It would become a discontinuity in historical progress. For contrary to those who doubted the feasibility of packet switching, it worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though at first information was available only to the most interested, Arpanet would become widely known. Those heavily invested in circuit switching, such as the firms designing and building modems and multiplexers, charged on in their own world, ignoring the coming of packet switching. It was not that they did not see the growing computerization of corporate America, they did. Only they saw immediate products, revenue and success doing what they already knew how to do. The next chapter tells the story of Data Communications from 1969 through 1972. The following chapter reconstructs how the Arpanet went from the letting of a contract to a demonstrable system.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/5.0/Overview/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By year-end 1968, the decisions by the management of Codex and Milgo, to broaden out of their government contracting businesses and sell modems, showed markings of genius. Both companies were now public with cash in the bank and growth in their strategic plans. Even the multiplexer start-up, American Data Systems (ADS), had reason to be giddy. They had innovated the next generation time-division multiplexer and signed a million dollar contract to supply product to IBM. The managements of all three firms were so overwhelmed they had little time to worry about new competition or speculate as to how government policies might affect future sales. Which proved fortunate, for if they had, they might have doubted what they were doing and lost the very nerve that had them looking like early winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunities in data communication had become obvious by 1972, with over one hundred new competitors fielding products. Certain of these entrants had histories closely intertwined with those of Codex Milgo and ADS. The entrepreneurs founding Infotron, General DataComm, Timeplex, Paradyne, Vadic and Universal Data Systems, all acted for very personal, or local, reasons not because they saw weaknesses in those who had preceded them or because they possessed some grand vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which was probably a good thing, for if they had, the drastic economic brakes the Federal Government applied in January 1969 would have scared off all but the most committed. Concerned about inflation and an over-heating economy, the Government raised interest rates, increased the tax rates on capital gains, and filed an anti-trust suit against IBM. The days of ever-rising stocks prices would soon end, especially for technology stocks, and years of economic uncertainty would dampen investment and purchases of technology products including data communication products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the news was depressing however. The continual saga between AT&amp;amp;T and the FCC pointed towards more market competition and less market regulation. Not that AT&amp;amp;T was rolling over without a fight. One attempt to stifle competition resulted in the banding together of the modem manufacturers into a trade association, the Independent Data Communication Manufacturer’s Association (IDCMA). This group would prove instrumental in countering the immense market power of AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding all of the uncertainty surrounding them, the fates of Codex, Milgo and ADS continued to be decided more by their internal decisions and actions than by market forces or economic conditions. By the end of 1972, Codex and Milgo would have succeeded in their transitions to profitable companies while ADS would be struggling.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/5.1/Entrepreneurism-Flourishes-1968-1972/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1968, the economic opportunities in data communications from the increasing use of computers by corporations, the certainty of coming market competition in telecommunications, and the unprecedented capital available to be invested in high technology companies, all combined to fuel entrepreneurial ambitions. From a mere handful of competitors in 1968, over one hundred firms would be selling modems and multiplexers by 1972. The following firms would join Codex, Milgo and ADS in eventually seizing market leadership and market share from AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;infotron&quot;&gt;Infotron&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, a frustrated Stan Hunkins challenged his boss, the vice president of engineering of Ultronic Systems. Hunkins said he could assemble a volunteer team and design a stock-quote desk system in two months, a task the company had not been able to accomplish in over two years. Given a green light, they succeeded. Afterwards the team members hungered for more such opportunities and freedom. However, the acquisition of Ultronic by General Telephone &amp;amp; Electronics (GTE), a $2 billion company, portended more bureaucracy. The conversations of the group soon turned to forming their own company. In September 1968, Hunkins, Jim Hahn, Joe Andrews and Tony Barbaro launched Infotron in Hunkins’ basement. From their Ultronic background, they knew that companies wanted to interface large number of asynchronous terminals to computers. So they decided to innovate a time division multiplexer (TDM). In 1969 they introduced their TL110, so named because it multiplexed teletype machines that ran at 110 bits per second (bps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-datacomm&quot;&gt;General DataComm&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the founders of Infotron, Charles P. Johnson did not need others to convince him of the opportunities in data communications. Working early in his career at Illinois Bell Telephone, then selling telephone services to the SAGE project for International Telephone and Telegraph, and finally working for the military contractor Stelma, Johnson understood the need for modems and multiplexers. After Data Products Inc. acquired Stelma in 1968, Johnson decided it was time to strike out on his own. Needing a team, he approached others dissatisfied with the Data Products acquisition. Over the winter of 1968, Johnson, Robert Smith, Tom Lehrman and Jack Arcara wrote a business plan. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At that time, in the commercial world, you basically had your telephone network and some private line teletype nets that were supplied by Western Union or AT&amp;amp;T.  The way you fixed things is that when something went wrong, you picked up the phone and called Western Union or AT&amp;amp;T and said:  “My circuit’s down.  Fix it,” and you waited for it to get fixed.  For administrative teletype nets, low speed stuff, that was probably ok, but now you’ve got this huge computer center, and there’s going to be remote terminals – timesharing was beginning to come into vogue by that time – and that was not enough. We wanted to provide modems and multiplexers that not only could pass data through, link to link, but also have some diagnostic capability. We wanted to provide the user with some information as to what was happening. So there were some philosophies that came out of our background in the military systems and these big networks that were the foundation of the business plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the Johnson-led team formed General DataComm Industries, Inc. Incrementally innovating on the widely successful ADS-660 time-division multiplexer (TDM), they introduced their TDM at the International Communications Association trade show in 1970. They would have sales of $160, 000 in 1970 with a loss of $676,000. Western Union would be their first customer, and remained their most important customer for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeplex&quot;&gt;Timeplex&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Ed Botwinick, an analyst with the investment bank Goldman Sachs, came across a business plan written by a group of engineers wanting to leave Western Union to start a company selling TDMs (Sidney Kaplan, Richard Schmal John Elich). Having passed on making an investment in ADS a year earlier, Botwinick had maintained an interest in TDMs and met with the engineers. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their business plan didn’t really make sense, but their product plans did, so I became a member of the founding group, and I rewrote the business plan and raised all of the start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an initial investment of $210, 000, Timeplex began operations in 1969. In 1970, struggling to make sales, Timeplex signed a take or pay agreement with industry-leader Milgo. They ended 1970 with sales of $109, 000 and a loss of $205, 000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;paradyne&quot;&gt;Paradyne&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, a group of engineers led by Joe Looney left Control Data Corporation and founded Paradyne. Backed by venture capitalists, they pursued a product strategy of building modems and front-end data communication processors to be connected to mainframe computers. For five years they would struggle before becoming a leading modem manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;vadic&quot;&gt;Vadic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1969, Kim Maxwell and six others founded Vadic, one of dozens of companies that would jump into the dial-up modem business. At first, Vadic planned to develop both control systems and modems because they had one person who knew a little about each. But soon they realized they needed more focus and collectively decided it would be modems. Maxwell remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We looked around and then Carterphone sort of began to dawn on us as we went and talked to some potential customers. “What kind of modems would you like?” Well, people said things like Bell 103s. So we decided we better go find out what a 103 was. We bought the technical book from AT&amp;amp;T and we read through it. Now that tells you the level of knowledge and sophistication of this company that created the dial-up modem business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few years, Vadic would challenge AT&amp;amp;T as the leading innovator of dial-up modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;universal-data-systems&quot;&gt;Universal Data Systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Mark Smith, an engineer with SEI Systems, a government contractor, realized he did not want to work in an engineering job shop forever: he wanted to create products to sell. As he searched for what to do, he began reading about Carterphone. Knowing nothing about modems, he contacted AT&amp;amp;T to speak to a modem salesman. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the, quote, “salesman” came out and explained to me the reason that AT&amp;amp;T’s unit was more expensive and five times as big as the other units that were starting to show up on the market was that it had more resistors and capacitors in it, I figured that this might be a good business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Smith and a friend, John Howell, decided to start their own company, Universal Data Systems. Having but $30,000 between them, they kept their jobs and worked nights and weekends to build their first product, a Bell 202 lease-line modem. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We did the Bell 202 modem simply because it was conceptually, in every way, the simplest possible thing you could do, and we wanted to get started with something.  By August of ‘70, we had ten units that were basically complete. So we had our show and tell units. The first of August I resigned. We still had 25 of our $30,000 left by that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hustling whatever opportunities they could uncover, they soon bid on a large job for the Southern Company, a major utility in the southeast. In October they were notified they had lost the bid to ADS. Nearly out of cash and an end to their entrepreneurial aspirations, they received an unexpected phone call in December. Smith recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The program manager in Birmingham had gotten mad, for whatever reason, with ADS. He asked us if we’d like to supply the modems.  We said:  “Heavens, yes.” So we got a contract for maybe $200,000, and, in addition, we got a $50,000 advance.  That put us in business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in entrepreneurship was not limited to data communications. New firm formation also reshaped the nature of competition in software and minicomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1960’s, thousands of new software firms were founded, mostly after 1966.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  The real stampede occurred in 1969, after IBM’s announcement in December 1968 implying that they were going to unbundle software, which they formally announced in June 1969.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  While many speculated that the antitrust lawsuit the Government filed against IBM on January 17, 1969 prompted IBM’s decision, the more probable reason was software was becoming prohibitively expensive to develop and maintain. Software sold in generic packages to many customers had not yet evolved. Instead, software had to be created from scratch for every application and was generally a massive undertaking, a view reinforced by the expensive and challenging development of the software for IBM’s System/360. The well-publicized IBM experience reinforced that of the first true software project, the SAGE project, which at its peak, in 1959, employed more than 700 programmers and 1400 support people, half the total software manpower in the United States.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Yet after IBM’s unbundling announcement, entrepreneurs were ready to transform the opportunities in software into successful companies. Total sales of software, estimated to be only $20 million to $50 million in 1969, would soar to $400 million in 1975.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful software companies invariably used data communication products as did the products they sold to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;minicomputers&quot;&gt;Minicomputers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also driving the need for data communication products was be the new category of computers called minicomputers. With a history that also dates to the SAGE Project, and is considered to formally have begun with the introduction of the PDP-8 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1965, an industry with only a handful of firms in 1968 exploded to more than one hundred firms with the entrance of ninety-two competitors between 1968 and 1972, sixty percent being new start-ups.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  Sales would skyrocket from $200 million in 1968 to nearly $1.5 billion in 1975. More than four times as many minicomputers would be sold in 1975 than mainframe computers, tens of thousands of computers potentially needing modems and multiplexers, especially after time sharing-based minicomputers started becoming available after 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transforming changes taking place in information technologies were staggering because of new standards in software; advances in semiconductor technology such as Large Scale Integration (LSI) technology, integrated circuits, and semiconductor memory; on-line, real-time computing such as timesharing; radical reductions in costs due to volume production; capital available both privately and publicly; and quickening use of computers by corporations, all leading to ferment and growth, albeit no one at the time had a crystal ball as to how it would all shake out.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  Adding to the confusion were the gyrations in economic policy meant to bring stability but resulting in a roller coaster lasting longer than anyone would have imagined, or certainly wanted.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;On January 7th, 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank, fearing inflation, decided to slow the economy by raising interest rates: the prime interest rate would jump to a record 7%. Compounding the deadening effects of this dramatic rate hike, Congress in that same month increased the capital gains tax to 35% from 24% and repealed the Investment Tax Credit.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By November 1969, these actions had their intended effect and economic activity peaked, ending a growth cycle dating back to February 1961.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  A year later, November 1970, the economy bottomed and then grew for three years before peaking once more in November 1973. The next bottom was attained in March 1975. These quick successions of peaks and bottoms made for very different conditions than the ever-predictable growth of the 1960’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-year 1969, investors could no longer ignore the fateful signs of a slowing economy and the stock markets turned bearish. For anyone who did not appreciate how over-priced technology stocks had become, they soon took notice as their luster proved more a reflection of investors’ greed than companies’ prospects. Indicative of how technology would be impacted, domestic shipments of computer hardware dropped from $5.5 billion in 1969 to between $4-4.5 billion in 1970.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venture capital also began drying up in 1969. In 1970 and 1971 about half the amount committed in 1969 was invested in venture capital funds. (See Exhibit 3.0 Net New Commitments to Venture Capital Firms 1969 to 1978.) And that was the good news, because in the following years venture capital all but dried up. The lack of both public and private capital caused management to scramble. Thousands of companies that once dreamed of going public quickly sought to merge or be acquired. The stock markets would rebound with double digital growth in 1971 and 1972 before dropping drastically in 1973 and 1974 (the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index dropped 14.7% in 1973 and 26.5% in 1974).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;net-new-commitments-to-venture-capital-firms---1969-to-1978-million&quot;&gt;Net New Commitments to Venture Capital Firms - 1969 to 1978 ($million)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1969&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1969&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1971&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1972&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1973&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1974&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1975&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1977&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1978&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;505.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;271.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;251.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;156.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;133.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;124.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;19.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;93.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;68.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;978.1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The Carterfone decision of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1968 prompted, or likely forced, AT&amp;amp;T to change its prohibition on foreign attachments, and file new tariffs that became effective January 1, 1969. While these new “protective connecting arrangements” (PCAs) tariffs opened the door for entrepreneurs eyeing the opportunity to sell dial-up modems against AT&amp;amp;T, the struggle to obtain unobstructed market competition would take years of effort. At the time, however, the founders of Vadic, UDS and dozens of other start-ups saw only the opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCA tariffs for modems were called Data Access Arrangements, or DAAs. DAAs had two primary functions: first to assure the telephone network integrity by limiting the signal power of attached modems to a level that would not exceed the power-level of the network, and second to maintain exclusive Bell control of all network signaling functions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  Installable only by Bell personnel for a modest amount, and a continuing $2 to $4 per month fee, DAAs were a single circuit board that came with a separate telephone set having a voice/data switch. All network connections had to be made manually, and there were no provisions for either automatic dialing or unattended answering; even though Bell modems possessed these functions. So while the DAAs made it possible for independent manufacturers’ to connect their modems to the switched telephone network, they severely constrained their functionality and introduced costs over those of Bell modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protests sounded immediately. Why should modems of independent manufacturers be burdened with extra costs and reduced functionality? Bell was up to its old tricks again. Only now there were competitors not willing to let Bell get away with it. What seemed particularly preposterous to the independent manufacturers selling modems to telephone companies was that their modems would now have to be re-engineered to work with DAAs. Where was the logic that made it possible for independent manufacturers to sell a modem to a telephone company, which could sell it to a customer, while that very same modem manufacturer could not sell the same modem to that same customer? In response, AT&amp;amp;T claimed: “If we provide it, we maintain it and we know it’s going to work right. If the customer provides it, he might not maintain it, and a short might cause a voltage surge on the line which might kill somebody.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sympathetic as the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) staff was, the new AT&amp;amp;T tariffs were already more liberal than anyone would have thought possible only months earlier, and too much was at risk to proceed ‘willy-nilly.’ Bernard Strassburg, Chairman of the CCB, remembers telling those complaining:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, you may be right, but this is where it is right now, and until we find a better alternative, this is where it’s going to stay, because we’re not going to open up the network to indiscriminate connections for fear that this would degrade the performance of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing arm-in-arm with AT&amp;amp;T might have been past practice, but now the CCB wanted an independent assessment of alternatives to PCAs, freeing them from their dependence on AT&amp;amp;T’s recommendations. Seeking the most impartial, technically competent organization, the FCC contracted with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study the tariffs and to recommend alternatives.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;  A report was expected in about a year, with hearings scheduled for September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this same period, in February 1969, the FCC received the Stanford Research Institute report commissioned to analyze the responses to the Notice of Inquiry.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;  The report was too technical and detailed to be understood by anyone at the FCC or CCB. So Strassburg once again sought out Paul Baran, who had since left Rand and started the Institute for the Future (IF).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;  Baran agreed to interpret the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after taking the assignment, AT&amp;amp;T offered Baran’s IF a lucrative, and interesting, consulting contract. Needing the work, Baran notified the FCC of his potential conflict of interest and ceased being a consultant.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;  Baran remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it was very useful because they were able to get some inputs in how they are really perceived…..and that their real problem is going to come from the data communication entrepreneurs, because now, for the first time, they had a constituency who might perceived it worth their while going after AT&amp;amp;T. The old constituency in the past was never big enough, or had enough interest, to attend hearings or doing anything, but now you have these new entrepreneurs coming along and that you’re probably better off giving in to them and not threaten the rest of your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the FCC issued the Report and Further Notice of Inquiry to solicit opinions on the SRI study. Respondents’ comments would add little to the FCC’s understanding.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;  The CCB now had the task of deciding what actions they should, and would, take as a result of collecting the comments and materials through its Inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In early 1969, Codex used money from its public offering to fund a promotions campaign for its AE-96 modem. Mindful that if they could sell 50 modems in the coming year that they would equal all of last year’s sales, they were both stunned and ecstatic when they received 8,000 inquiries. It seemed as though all they had to do was scale up manufacturing and begin filling orders. That was until they had experience with customers using their modem. The AE-96 would not stay working. Carr remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We used to joke that we had made something less than 100 AE-96’s and shipped several hundred of them, because they kept coming back and going out and coming back and going out again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each passing month, Carr increasingly bore the brunt of Jim Cryer’s frustrations. Cryer, Carr’s boss and President, read the overwhelming interest in the AE-96 as customers ready to buy and didn’t want to hear Carr’s excuse of ‘but it doesn’t work’ for not meeting sales objectives. Since it had been Cryer’s decision, or mistake as was becoming more apparent, to bet the future of Codex on the AE-96, he leaned on his management to get results, at least as much as his emotions would let him. Being an engineer, this was difficult. And when results were not forthcoming, he felt betrayed and ever more isolated as he watched the ramped up operating expenses depleting the dwindling cash remaining from the Initial Public Offering. Crisis invaded every conversation and decision, suffocating any joy from their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving the cash crisis meant solving the AE-96 problem. No one understood the problem, much less the solution. Holsinger was stumped. Kohlenberg, bereft of ideas, turned in frustration to G. Dave Forney, who worked exclusively on R&amp;amp;D development contracts, and asked him to drop what he was doing to help. Forney, who had joined Codex in 1965 at the suggestion of Gallager, earned his Ph.D. from MIT in information theory and had virtually no modem experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A frustrated Holsinger identified the problem of the AE-96 as “phase jitter” – a problem he thought he had solved at DRC. Phase jitter, while endemic to telephone lines, remained largely unrecognized for it had no affect on voice communications or the slower speed modems of the day. Since telephone lines were not controlled for phase, every circuit could differ as to being either in phase or not. Phase fluctuations – hence jitter – caused modems that seemed equalized to the circuit’s characteristics to lose equalization. Since the AE-96s could neither detect nor correct phase problems, if phase jitter occurred, they ceased working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forney quickly, and cleverly, conceived of how to detect and correct phase jitter errors enough of the time to stabilize the performance of the AE-96. With Forney’s innovation, AE-96’s once equalized to a circuit could adapt to subsequent phase jitter. The required electronics forced the addition of another printed circuit board that had to be hung under the lid of the modem for lack of space. Named the Threshold Decision Computer (TDC) for marketing reasons, it pulled out as if from a drawer and had a red light that flashed every time it corrected an error. Carr recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, it worked. In fact, I remember going to Air France in Paris, which was the first transatlantic installation of 9600 bit per second traffic, and they used to run it with the drawer out all the time because it somehow gave them comfort to see this red light blinking, and I’d stand there watching the red light blinking and I said to myself – this was a machine that I had now observed going out and coming back because the equalizer wasn’t converging, and they were telling me how happy they were with it, and how wonderful it was, and how much money it was saving them, and I was standing there, shaking my head and looking at this light blinking on and off, and saying: “I really don’t believe I’m here.” You talk about pioneering days, it was really pretty bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Pugh, Director of Product Marketing since January 1969 when recruited from 3C by his former and now current boss, Carr, wanted to include the TDC with every AE-96 without charge, arguing that the modem did not work without it. But Cryer, facing a survival-threatening cash crisis, insisted it be sold as an extra. So the TDC, which made for a stable and working AE-96, sold for $2,000 and shipped with every modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, working AE-96s made obvious the problem that commercial customers did not have peripherals that communicated at 9600 bps. Recalling their days at 3C when they sold minicomputers to multiplex many incoming communication lines to host computers, Carr and Pugh turned to the idea of using a multiplexer. If Codex had a small, inexpensive multiplexer to multiplex and demultiplex eight 1200 bps lines, or four 2400 bps lines, onto one 9600 bps line, then the AE-96 would provide the transmission speeds customers wanted. As if by magic, a multiplexer of eight or four lines solved another problem thought to stand in the way of success. The added expense of the multiplexers, as well as the premium paid for the AE-96s, were recovered easily through reduced telephone line costs, for in the case of eight-line multiplexers and AE-96s, only one telephone line would be needed, not eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr and Pugh contacted ADS seeking to buy multiplexers they could resell, thus becoming an OEM to ADS – an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sells product that others resell, either with or without attribution. ADS had absolutely no interest in a OEM arrangement, strained as they were to engineer all the products in their development queue. Carr and Pugh then began arguing their case to Cryer and the engineers. Relieved to have at least reason for optimism, Cryer authorized an internal development effort to develop a multiplexer. (See Appendix 3.  Codex Marketing literature.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having persuaded Cryer of the logic of multiplexers, Carr next pressed his case for a 4800 bps modem. Only this time his reasoning fell on deaf ears, for building a product already being sold did not conform to the Codex credo of creating technically challenging products. But Carr refused to give up; every day his salesmen complained of having sold customers on upgrading to higher-speed modems, only to have them buy perceived less risky 4800 bps modems, often from Milgo, a competitor of growing concern to Carr. Certain he was right, Carr pressed Cryer at every opportunity: “A, it will work. B, I can sell it, and it would be nice if we had some money coming into the place!” Yet as hard as he lobbied and fought for a 4800, Cryer remained unyielding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By November, Holsinger no longer could repress his inner calling to start his own company, and he resigned from Codex. The man who first proved a 9600 bps modem possible had seen his knowledge and expertise institutionalized as Codex’s growing engineering department. Lacking challenges and sensing a boring future engineering slower speed modems, as being argued for by Carr and Pugh, Holsinger concluded he could do the same in a company of his own. In 1970, using the profits from the sale of his Codex stock, Holsinger, the entrepreneur, joined a long list of start-ups founding Intertel.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/5.5/ADS-Has-a-Blockbuster-1969/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;ADS had a head of steam entering 1969 with an innovative TDM and a contract with IBM. In having built diagnostics into the ADS-660, ADS had found a way to wedge itself successfully between the computer companies and the telecommunications giant AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;   So while it made for an uncomfortable existence, it was turf neither AT&amp;amp;T nor IBM claimed and offered fertile ground to grow before the behemoths awoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, sales, and thus the need for working capital, were growing so rapidly that despite their run-away success ADS was strapped for cash. Unfortunately in early 1969, selling stock to the public no longer existed as an option. In specifics lost to time, the Autonetics Division of North American Rockwell (Rockwell), a major defense and space contractor, and ADS learned of each other and began exploring whether an opportunity existed for ADS to exploit Rockwell’s modem technology. Rockwell had developed an automatically equalizing 4800 bps modem under military contract and now wanted to sell it commercially. ADS’s management couldn’t believe their good fortune. Only Milgo had a 4800 bps and it suffered from having to be manually equalized to the conditions of the telephone line. Not having to provide or pay for manual equalization would represent a significant economic and selling advantage.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hasty negotiations, an agreement was reached. Rockwell would sell their technology to ADS for $2 million. In return, Rockwell would invest more than $2 million in ADS and guarantee a line of credit in return for 25% ownership, leaving management and existing investors with 75% ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before year-end 1969, ADS shipped the first commercially available automatically equalizing 4800 bps modem. It was a disaster economically, however, costing as much to make as the price for which it could be sold. Without any good alternatives, management decided to sell the existing version until a modem built with new semiconductor chips from Rockwell could replace it. Then the projected cost of the modem would drop from $2,000, to $600 a unit – resulting in $1,400 of profit per modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heady from being uniquely positioned as the only company selling both TDMs and high-speed modems, ADS management broadened their vision to becoming the dominant supplier of all products needed to connect computers and remote peripherals, including IBM 2260 compatible controllers, computer based front-end processors, CRT terminals and terminals to replace either teletypes or IBM 2741 terminals. Bill Norred, head of engineering and manufacturing, began ramping up the engineering organization and, before the end of 1969, had a staff of nearly three hundred. ADS had close to four hundred employees. Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea was that we would literally provide everything from the computer interface all the way out to the terminal, except the telephone lines. In fact, I’ll never forget running this big multi-page ad, based upon the American Flag, that showed we provide everything but the computers and the telephone lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Propelled by the demand for their TDM’s, ADS revenues soared to nearly $5.0 million in 1969. ADS became the runaway success of data communications.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Carr knew he had to deliver or his days with Codex were numbered – Cryer had made that abundantly clear. Carr’s ears rang from Cryer’s blistering tirades: “I want to see results and I don’t want to hear again about needing a 4800 bps modem.” Carr understood that Codex faced a cash crisis, one stressing Cryer, but he expected a little empathy for the uphill battles he and his salesmen waged every day. Competition had never been more intense and if rumor had it correctly, Milgo would soon introduce a 9600 bps modem, eliminating Codex’s one truly unique advantage. Carr remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What was happening was Bell people would go around and say:  “Look, if 9600 was possible, AT&amp;amp;T would have done it. We have Bell Labs.” Scared the hell out of the customer.  Milgo would go out and say:  “Don’t buy two of these spooky things, buy four 48’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1970, Carr and Pugh scheduled a product-planning meeting to discuss the future of the AE-96. No one anticipated a meeting any different from the many other meetings they had shoe-horned into days routinely stretching into late nights, but history would judge differently, for decisions were made that set Codex on the path to becoming the world’s largest independent data communications firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refreshingly, after so many meetings devoted to yet another AE-96 crisis, the subject concerned the future and what Codex should do as an encore now that they had a product that worked, at least most of the time. After some light-hearted banter, and before the conversation could turn serious, Carr turned crusader once again, arguing that the sales force did not need an improved 9600 bps modem, at least not immediately, but rather they needed more products to sell - specifically a 4800 bps modem. Cryer, stubborn as Carr, repeated the obvious: they had barely enough cash to survive selling the products they had and certainly not enough to develop and launch a new product. He concluded with the now expected speech that the credo of Codex was to advance the state-of-the-art not to mimic the latest products of so-called competitors. And furthermore, how could Codex sell me-too products if they couldn’t even sell the world’s most advanced modem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the meeting could turn into another pointless standoff, Forney, who had become involved with modems again after Holsinger’s departure, suggested that maybe it need not be an either-or choice. He described a new technology being developed by Gallager, code named Modem-X, which was very different than the single sideband technology used in the AE-96 – a technology with which a competitive 4800 bps modem could not be built.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Forney believed the Modem-X technology, which would become known as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), could be the basis for both a better 4800 bps and a significantly improved 9600 bps modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lengthy discussion, Cryer relented, authorizing Forney to lead an effort to build first a 4800 bps and following that a 9600 bps modem using the Modem-X technology. Why did Cryer finally give in? Carr recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just incessant pressure from me, and the fact that we had a very bad year in ‘69. We were losing money, and had a bad negative cash flow. And I said: “Look, one thing about this, whether it’s challenging to you or not, Jim, I can sell it. I can collect from people for it without umpty-ump months of testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unknown to Carr, Cryer had already concluded that Carr had to be fired. However, he also knew he had to raise more money, and firing the VP of Sales immediately prior to a financing was a sure way to stall investors’ decisions until a new VP was hired, a delay he could not afford. He also did not want to hear potential investors parrot Carr’s insistence on the need for a 4800 bps modem. Fortunately, Forney had proposed a most ingenious solution: a potentially radical new technology to advance the state-of-art of 9600 bps modems, and also a virtually risk-free means to innovate a competitive 4800 bps modem. Carr seemed to win the day, but for reasons he did not yet understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pugh charged off to create both product specifications. Benefiting from the year of selling - and not selling - the AE-96, the specifications would focus on ease of installation, use, and service. Able to specify precise performance and quality measurements, Pugh set technical objectives that would make the new modems significantly better than the AE-96. Pugh also needed to project how many of each modem would be sold. Carr remembers his and the financial officer, Jim Storey’s, reactions to Pugh’s forecast:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked John Pugh to produce a forecast for how many 9600’s we could sell, and his forecast was 465 for the life of the machine, and we all sat around my conference table and howled laughing. We thought, and I’ll never forget it, I can see it like it was yesterday – we had sold and made stay 70 some AE-96s, so he was talking something like four times what we had done, and we thought it was so goddamned hilarious. We could believe that kind of a number for 4800’s, and Storey ridiculed the hell out of him. It’s a legend around Codex about this meeting, where we all laughed at John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forney had started work immediately, knowing Codex’s future depended on his success. Sales of the existing AE-96 were nowhere near sufficient to support the company financially. Government contracts were a luxury of the past, and financial projections indicated Codex would be out of cash in a few months, and unable to meet their bank’s requirements to borrow money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking alternatives, Cryer and Storey began discussions with their investment bankers, Kuhn, Loeb &amp;amp; Co., hoping to raise the equity capital needed to finance operations. By the end of March, terms were finalized and the closing scheduled for April 6th. With their money problems soon to be over, management sighed a collective relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr then left for Hawaii to attend a military conference. He had been trying to sell the military a way to create more communication circuits, or channels, out of existing circuits – the military had a desperate need of more international circuits as a consequence of the Vietnam War. Carr believed if he could sell the “channel packing” concept, it might generate desperately needed revenues and cash flow. Since most of those in the chain of command he needed to convince were attending the Hawaiian conference, he hoped he might pull one more order out of the military, an order that would give Codex breathing room until their new modems were ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After encouraging meetings, Carr returned home on Sunday April 5th to be available, if needed, for the closing of the financing on Monday. Tired from the long trip, he was greeted at his front door by an anxious baby sitter with a handful of phone messages marked Urgent. His first call back left him stunned. Earlier that day, Jim Cryer had died from a heart attack while playing tennis. An emergency Board of Directors meeting was to be held the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Monday morning the shock of Jim’s death crowded out the stress everyone had been feeling. No one knew what to say. The Board members offered their condolences to the staff, and awkwardly drifted into the conference room, trying to collect their thoughts before the meeting began. Kohlenberg, weakened by Hodgkin’s disease, came in, knowing the company he helped found was deep in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the meeting was called to order, the representatives of Kuhn, Loeb &amp;amp; Co. explained that under the circumstances it would be impossible to close the financing. A new investment memorandum had to be written and circulated. Realistically, it would be months before a financing might close. After a few blank stares, the bankers left, and the conversation turned to: Who was to run the company? What was to be done about cash?&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;  Carr remembers what happened then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I found out, much to my surprise that day, that I was right at the top of the shit list, that I was about to be fired because the view of the board was that I had joined the company and I had pissed all this money away and not brought in any business, which was accurate, although there were, God knows, an awful lot of other flaws in the company, like the product didn’t work and we couldn’t build it and a few other trivial things like that. But just about every VP of Sales along Route 128 was being fired anyway, in those days. So I was literally within days of being canned when poor Jim dropped dead. So I walked into this board meeting, but hardly anybody was talking to me. And I’ll never forget, Arthur [Kohlenberg] came in that day, because of this tragedy, and the man was shaking like a leaf. He was in terrible shape. He was watching all of this, and after a while – and he was always known as Arthur and I was always known as Art. He said:  “You know, there’s something I don’t understand here. Why are you being unpleasant to Art?” The guy that was called the chairman, a fellow named Tom Meloy who was a legend in his own right, launched into this: “He’s pissed away all this money and not sold anything,” and Arthur really lit into him, that they didn’t know what was going on, that you can’t sell something that doesn’t work. He told them about the equalizers that didn’t converge and the whole nine yards, and when he got all done, probably a three or four minute monologue, he was so exhausted that he had to leave, and he said something like: “You stick with this guy. It’s not his problem,” and so on, and he left. That was the last time I ever saw him alive, because he died that July. He was never able to come back to work after that meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board elected Jim Storey Chief Financial Officer, or COO. Carr was neither fired nor made to feel welcomed. Carr continues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next month after Jim died, the Penn Central [a major railroad corporation] went bankrupt, and the whole spring of ‘70 was sort of the bottom of that whole thing and it was doomsday everywhere.” A few weeks went by and Kuhn, Loeb sent this book up that had no more correspondence to Codex than if I wrote a book [investment memorandum] about whales. We looked at it and said: ‘What the hell is this?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the next thing that happened was, they said:  “You’re the goddamn salesman, so you write a memorandum, and you go sell some stock.” And Fulton Rockwell, who was individual self-made venture capitalist on the board and investor in the company, he and I were designated by the board to go raise this money. Kuhn, Loeb threw up their hands. They said: “You can see, we not only don’t know anything about the company, we can’t raise the money.  We just can’t make these phone calls anymore, and if we’ve got to do it the real way, we don’t know how to do that for a company like this,” so Fulton and I were designated to go raise some money. I didn’t know anything about raising money, memorandums or any of that stuff. So I sat down and wrote this memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Along about the summer, Fulton and I went out and basically got thrown out of every place we went to trying to sell this sick company for – to get a half million dollars of working capital! Our concept was to go get $600,000, and when somebody told us how many shares we had to give them to get $600,000, that’s what we would do. It was in that state. In the meantime, we didn’t have any cash, because we needed the cash when Jim was going to close it, so every two weeks, Jerry Katzin and Storey and I would go down to the First of Boston, and we would beg for some payroll, and they would tell us that we couldn’t have it. “Get some equity,” and we’d show them the memorandum. This was a regular ritual. “Then sell the company,” and we said we would sell the company to anybody that will buy it, “just give us a couple of weeks payroll,” and that went on every couple of weeks. We offered the company to Raytheon. We offered the company to Damon, who was in the medical lab, blood analysis business; Christ, a rubber company in Muskegon, which made retreaded tires. Anybody the bank wanted to us to talk to we would. We offered the company to Milgo. We met them in New York, and then they came up and they visited the building in Newton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forney gave the Milgo executives a briefing and demonstrated the Modem-X, or QAM, technology. He remembers: “But they turned us down anyway.” ADS executives also investigated Codex before passing on the opportunity. (ADS and ESE had used a similar 16-point QAM in their 4800 bps modems as early as 1970.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;  Why ADS was not interested might be understandable given they had a similar technology, but Milgo passing is mystifying with the reasons lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Forney had a working 4800 bps modem, albeit only a breadboard prototype, one still a long way from a shippable product. But the prototype worked, and given everyone’s somber mood, this success represented a small ray of hope. A working prototype was also the kind of promising news that one would have thought might impress a potential acquirer of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of August a financing appeared possible. The partners of a new venture capital partnership, the Technology Fund, indicated a strong interest in investing $300,000. Carr remembers the month of September:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the beginning of September, Becker said they would put $300,000 up if A.) I would take over the company; B.) I would put some of my money in it, which I didn’t have; and C.) we got other investors together for a minimum of $600,000, which is what Cryer was looking for. I looked at all these numbers and everything said I would take over only if we raised a million or more, so we got into this circle problem. So the guy, a fellow named Higgins that Rockwell turned up, agreed to match Becker, so now we had $600,000, and then Kuhn, Loeb skinnied around and found enough other people. We actually raised $1,250,000. I had Fulton Rockwell sign a note for me at the bank and I borrowed $25,000 and put up my $25,000, which I wish was $50 or $100,000. I remember my wife asking: “Why are you going to do this thing?” And I said: “If I do it, we’ve got a shot.  If I don’t do it, we’re all out of work.  I’ve been betting on myself for years, I might as well do this.” She said: “What are the chances?” I said: “This thing looks like a destroyer, but it behaves like a submarine. That’s all I can tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storey had to step down from COO, and he and I worked out an arrangement the board OK’d. He was made Exec VP. He and I had a meeting the night before we signed the papers for this million-two, and shook hands on the deal, where I’d be one and he’d be two and we’d not let each other down, even if this thing went astray. We had been basically enemies up until that time because he was really trying to hang me out to dry. But it was a great exercise in emergency behavior. So we raised the money. I took over September 26, 1970. What we did is I cut the place back. We had, I don’t know, probably 135 or 145 people. We cut it down to about 90. We concluded that all of us had to go back to do what we had done five years earlier to get maximum productivity. What we did was, we kept the higher priced people, took as many people out as we had to get the burn rate right. Storey and I became a team that September, and that team was inseparable for the next fifteen years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1970, at the fall Joint Computer Conference trade show in Houston, Texas, Codex introduced their 4800 bps modem based on the QAM technology. They boldly named it simply the – “4800,” as if setting the standard to which all others had to conform. It was an immediate hit. Once they began demonstrating the 4800 on customer telephone circuits, it seemed no matter how bad the circuits were, the modem worked perfectly, from the moment it powered up without any need for adjustments or tuning.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;  Codex began shipping the 4800 in January 1971, and couldn’t build units fast enough to meet demand.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;  Which was good, for sales in 1970 were only $1.1 million, down nearly 50% from 1969. They lost $3 million. If Forney had not succeeded, Codex would surely have gone under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milgo, which had sales of nearly $14 million in 1970, its second straight year of high double-digit growth, would be the most impacted by Codex’s success. Milgo’s sales in 1971 would drop 35%.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Coming off a spectacular 1969, when revenues were $5 million, everyone expected 1970 to be a gangbuster year and geared up accordingly. However, products were late, the market for timesharing stalled – it seemed everyone who could use a TDM multiplexer owned one – and the modem chips from Rockwell for the “killer” 4800 bps modem did not yet work. Sales were down, not up, while expenses continued to grow. In September, the Board elected a Rockwell executive to replace Wilkes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember the third year because I used to keep a forecast of around $32 million pinned on my wall, and I think we ultimately did about three or four or something. But that was 1970 when the world came to a screeching halt. One of the reasons was the modem. We actually shipped somewhere close to between 200 and 400 modems to the field, these automatically equalized modems, to find out that it had flaws we didn’t understand. It did not behave well in the presence of frequency translation and phase jitter. Those were two of the parameters that, not having a lot of knowledge in the modem world, we failed to adequately understand. We shipped a lot to the field and got a lot back. We were shipping to customers who were trying it saying: “Boy, we have a big requirement,” and unfortunately the modem just didn’t work well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase jitter haunted ADS, just as it had buffaloed Codex, and as it would challenge every firm trying to innovate a high-speed modem. Few succeeded, having to wait for the solution to become public knowledge, before they could introduce competitive products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had ADS fatally over-reached or would it right itself?&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/5.8/AT&T-and-Computer-Inquiry-I-1970-1971/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;After the FCC had issued the Report and Further Notice of Inquiry to solicit opinions on the SRI study and while waiting for the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report regarding the DAAs, Strassburg remembers his perspective changing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We, I at least, felt there was a compelling reason to be concerned about certain trends that were out there, that Bell couldn’t be all things to all people for all times, that the environment had changed, or was changing, and that innovation and creativity didn’t all start within the walls of Bell Labs, and all the wisdom wasn’t necessarily in Bell Labs. We were also concerned – I was concerned that AT&amp;amp;T was beginning to grow big, in terms of not only revenue – they had always been dominant as a corporate power – but at this time it was getting awfully big, so was there room for other participants in this marketplace called communications?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 3, 1970, the FCC issued its Tentative Decision and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 28 F.C.C. 2d 291 (1970) or the “Tentative Decision.” The entire proceedings become popularly known as the “Computer Inquiry.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;  Public argument on the Tentative Decision was scheduled for September 3, 1970, and March 18, 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tentative Decision addressed four key issues:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-processing-computer-services&quot;&gt;Data Processing Computer Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone agreed that data processing did not exhibit economies of scale as did natural monopolies such as telephone exchange services. Therefore, the FCC concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;…in view of all the foregoing evidence of an effective competitive situation, we see no need to assert regulatory authority over data processing facilities in order to link the terminals of subscribers to centralized computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission retained the prerogative to “re-examine the policies set forth herein…if there should develop significant changes in the structure of the data processing industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-carrier-provision-of-data-processing-services&quot;&gt;Common-Carrier Provision of Data-Processing Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of common carriers offering data processing services was a more complicated issue and one that remained unresolved until the Final Report. The problem arose because data processing had been declared an unregulated activity. How could economically motivated cross-subsidies within common carriers from regulated to unregulated businesses be avoided?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;store-and-forward-message-switching-services&quot;&gt;Store-and-Forward Message-Switching Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC concluded that message-switching services are “essentially communications” and “warrant appropriate regulatory treatment as common carrier services under the Act.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;hybrid-services&quot;&gt;Hybrid Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid services were those having both data processing and message-switching components. The Commission, using a “primary business test,” declared that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Where message switching is offered as an integral part of, and as an incidental feature of, a package offering that is primarily data processing, there will be total regulatory forbearance with respect to the entire service whether offered by a common carrier or non-common carrier, except to the extent that common carriers offering such a hybrid service will do so through [separate] affiliates…..If, on the other hand, the package offering is oriented essentially to satisfy the communications or message switching requirements of the subscriber, and the data processing feature or function is an integral part of, and incidental to message switching, the entire service will be treated as a communications service for hire, whether offered by a common carrier or a non-common carrier and will be subject to regulation under the Communications Act.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the FCC heard oral arguments on the Tentative Decision from some twenty interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, 1970, the FCC received the NAS report commissioned in response to the uproar by the independent modem manufacturers over the tariffs filed by AT&amp;amp;T requiring the use of PCAs (DAAs).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 5.8.1  - NAS Recommendation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uncontrolled interconnection could cause harm to personnel, network performance, and property.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The use of protective couplers and signal-level criteria was an acceptable way of assuring network protection; however, the added equipment increased overall costs.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A program of standards and enforced certification of equipment would be another acceptable way of assuring network protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent study commissioned by the FCC, Dittberner Associates, a Washington-based firm of computer consultants, concluded that manufacturers of data modems and other types of interconnected customer equipment could easily build into their equipment the necessary circuitry to protect the telephone network. The common carriers need not be the only ones providing network protective couplers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;  Furthermore, a program of standards and certification would be an inexpensive way to extend interconnection privileges without harm to the common-carrier network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the NAS and Dittberner reports agreed that safe attachment of customer provided equipment could be accomplished without the objectionable carrier-supplied access arrangements or PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;  Knowing an alternative to the PCAs existed, and given no cessation of complaints – long delays in getting PCAs installed, too expensive, and constantly changing interface specifications – the CCB needed a plan of action. Due to manufacturer and customer interest, PBX standards and certification procedures were attended to first. On March 26, 1971, the FCC established a PBX industry advisory committee with some thirty members representing carriers, equipment manufacturers, and users. This committee had the responsibility of devising technical standards, as well as creating certification and enforcement procedures permitting direct connection of PBX equipment to the telephone network – without using PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same month, on March 18, 1971, the FCC, in a divided 4 to 3 vote, rendered its Final Decision in the Inquiry (Final Decision, 28 FCC 2d 267 (1971)).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;  In it, the FCC introduced the concept of  “maximum separation” to solve the problem of common carriers wanting to provide data processing services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;  To compete in the unregulated field of data processing services, common carriers must create separate subsidiaries with separate books of account, separate officers, separate operating personnel, separate equipment, and facilities devoted exclusively to the rendition of data processing services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;  These subsidiaries would lease communication services from carriers (the parent company or any other carrier) under public tariffs, just like competing suppliers of data-processing services.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;  Some issues remained, however, particularly those of “hybrid services.” But in general, the regulatory issues between data processing and communications seemed to have been settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-581---nas-recommendation&quot;&gt;Exhibit 5.8.1 - NAS Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/PCA-diagram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of PCA agreement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;For Carr and Codex the upcoming International Communications Association (ICA) trade show in Atlanta in June 1971 couldn’t have been better timed. By far the largest industry trade show, the ICA served as a giant magnet to decision makers and purchasing agents of firms contemplating the use of data communication products. With every significant vendor assembled under one roof, customers could comparison shop, viewing the latest and greatest products every firm had to offer, especially those from firms not yet advertising or too small or too new to have established adequate product distribution. And for those attendees simply trying to make sense of the dazzling explosion of products promising to save money, improve performance, or revolutionize how corporations used computers, seminars and tutorials conducted by company representatives or industry consultants ran back-to-back from morning to night. In compressing the normally diffused interactions of buyers and sellers into a three-day public fishbowl, a young company’s future easily could rest on the outcome of this one show, and Carr intended to make ICA an unqualified success for Codex and the 4800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, AT&amp;amp;T’s proposed private-line modem tariff announcements drowned out any hopes that the 4800 would dominate the buzz of ICA: AT&amp;amp;T wanted all customer-supplied private-line modems to use DAAs, and it intended to slash the lease rates of its modems. Since third-party modems had been safely connected to private-lines for years, show goers wondered why the sudden change in AT&amp;amp;T policy other than to justify their inane policy requiring DAAs for dial-up modems? AT&amp;amp;T appeared to be closing the barn doors after the proverbial horses had escaped. One question dominated every conversation: What could, or would, the independent modem manufacturers do to fight this blatant attempt to squash competition and their futures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small dial-up modem manufacturers couldn’t have been happier and did all they could to stir the controversy. Maybe now the larger private-line modem firms would conjoin their fight, finally realizing that if they did not fight AT&amp;amp;T tooth and nail, they might all be put out of business. It seemed that no matter where one turned, the conversation remained the same: What could be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outraged along with everyone else, Carr tried to remain focused, knowing if he didn’t capitalize on the early success of the 4800 before competitive products emerged, it mattered little what AT&amp;amp;T did because Codex might not be around to compete. Still losing money and having invested time and scarce resources into having a new 9600 bps modem, Carr argued that as egregious as the proposed tariffs were, they had little real effect on Codex. Even if you added $10 a month to the cost of buying a $5,000 to $10,000 modem, it did not change the significant economic advantages of ownership. Since AT&amp;amp;T only leased their modems. Equally, AT&amp;amp;T could lower their lease rates as called for in their new Information System Access Line (ISAL) pricing, but their new 4800 bps modem did not even bear comparison to Codex’s 4800. Moreover, AT&amp;amp;T did not offer a 9600 bps modem. So yes, AT&amp;amp;T needed to be reined in, but for now that had to be left for others as Carr had neither the time nor money to join the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Bleckner and Matt Kinney, President and Vice President of Sales of Milgo, on the other hand, had urged modem manufacturers to protest AT&amp;amp;T’s filings with the FCC from the start and now carried their crusade to the floor of the convention.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt; As executives of the largest independent data communications company – sales of modems were $9.8 million in 1970 out of total revenue of $14 million – they knew they did not have the means to fight AT&amp;amp;T on their own, yet would have to assume a leadership role if any coordinated response was to be made. But how were they going to stimulate collective action of competitive firms without running into legal problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bleckner and Kinney canvassed the other firms, they quickly found allies in Chuck Johnson and the executives of General DataComm (GDC). Since GDC also sold dial-up modems, they already fought the use of DAAs and welcomed the idea of new comrades in arms. When Bleckner and Kinney approached Joe Looney, President of Paradyne, they found him receptive, but with little time or money to contribute since Paradyne had just begun selling product. On the other hand, Looney agreed that if AT&amp;amp;T had its way, Paradyne might not have a future. So, yes, he was interested enough to listen to what might be proposed. Even Carr conceded the importance of unanimity and agreed to attend a group meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to reach agreement on a plan of action before the show ended, Bleckner and Kinney invited executives of the other modem manufacturers to join them in their hotel suite after the close of the exhibitions one day. In an act of true mutualism, nearly a dozen firms agreed to form a trade association called the Independent Data Communications Manufacturers Association, or IDCMA. The purpose of the IDCMA would be to fight AT&amp;amp;T and lobby for market competition. Four companies, Milgo, GDC, Codex and Paradyne would be the four founding members with Bleckner, Johnson, Carr and Looney serving as the initial Board. One of their first acts would be to hire legal counsel and contest AT&amp;amp;T’s intentions to require DAAs for private-line modems – AT&amp;amp;T soon withdrew its filing. The IDCMA proved essential to the coming into being of the data communications market-structure and of users winning their rights of attachment and connection to AT&amp;amp;T’s telephone network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spirit of cooperation exhibited by the formation of the IDCMA did not affect the month-to-month slugging it out for sales, however, and 1971 proved a struggle for the nearly one hundred data communications firms.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

In October, just after the close of the fiscal year, Codex introduced the QAM-based 9600, the long awaited successor to the AE-96, priced at $11,500. The QAM technology gave Codex a significant advantage in the market as Pugh explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we came out with the AE-96, which was a suppressed carrier, single side band modulation, a lot of people moved in and copied that, which was a mistake for them, because we had the QAM modem on the drawing boards. And about the time that Milgo came out with a single side band machine, AT&amp;amp;T came out with a single side band machine, and we had then announced our 9600, which was a QAM machine. We had the market all to ourselves for several years because it took them that long to catch up. That modem lasted for four or five years, and it was a marketing game. The 9600 became an instant hit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex had cleared a major hurdle by successfully innovating its second-generation 9600 bps modem technology.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/5.11/ADS-Falls-on-Hard-Times-1971-1972/",

Hit simultaneously with plummeting multiplexer sales due to a weakening time-sharing market, ADS reeled under a succession of bad results turning worse. By the September 1971 Board of Directors meeting, everyone expected management changes. Rockwell, asserting its ownership rights, replaced the President named the prior year with another Rockwell executive and fired co-founder Schaaf. The discouraging results from ADS did not deter Rockwell in September 1971 from acquiring controlling interest of Collins Radio, an organization that, in theory, competed with ADS and had estimated sales of modems and multiplexers of $2 million in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 1971 gave way to 1972 and one month ground into the next with no pick-up in activity, ADS sank ever more deeply into the ranks of the also rans. After the habitual ax-wielding September Board meeting, Rockwell executives had had it. They fired Wilkes, cut the company back to a bare minimum, and tasked Norred with selling the shell of a company to whomever for whatever.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;For Codex, 1972 couldn’t have been more different. Early in the year, they received the news they had been hoping to hear for four years: they had won the channel packing contract. First proposed to the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) in 1968, and the occasion of Carr’s trip to Hawaii in 1970, the DCA had bureaucratically decided to ask for competitive bids for the contract, soliciting bids from forty-four firms. Two firms, Harris Corporation and Codex submitted bids, and Codex won the $7.5 million contract by a margin of less than one percent of the total price. Before the joy of victory could be savored, however, there remained one small problem: Codex did not have the money to buy the parts, build the units or finance the receivables. The contract, three times their previous year’s sales, totally dwarfed Codex’s dwindling resources. Cash at fiscal year end 1971 totaled but $20,000. With a history of raising money under the most dire of circumstances, management presumed the channel packing contract could make a financing a slam-dunk. So Carr promptly contacted their investment bankers, Kuhn Loeb, who agreed, and began writing a prospectus for a public equity financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Carr’s back began aching, he soon guessed financing problems were imminent, for every past financial crisis had precipitated back problems. Sure enough, Kuhn Loeb called requesting a meeting. In the course of their due diligence, they had discovered a report by the prestigious consulting firm of Arthur D. Little (ADL) The modem according to ADL would soon be made obsolete by the all digital data networks announced by AT&amp;amp;T and competitors such as Datran. Clearly, Kuhn Loeb could not sell stock to the public given such a bleak prognostication. Carr and Codex management, in shock, argued vainly as the bankers simply pleaded ignorance and left the meeting suggesting Carr write a report refuting the ADL conclusions, which they could review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their heads for far-too-long buried in the day-to-day struggle for survival, Carr and the rest of management were forced to pause and examine their industry’s prospects. In doing so, they came to two conclusions, one comforting and one startling. First, they persuasively argued that the threat posed by all digital data networks was overstated and the future was promising for modems. The conclusion was eagerly accepted by Kuhn Loeb who wanted to do the financing – for no financing meant no fees or trading profits. The second conclusion remained private and came as a cold shower to management. If they, Codex, did not act quickly to engineer LSI-based modems their QAM-modems would soon be uncompetitive because LSI semiconductor technology promised to transform dramatically the size, power requirements, performance and pricing of all integrated circuit products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;  In mulling over this conclusion, Carr remembered his recent meeting with Norred who was trying to sell the assets of ADS.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;  Carr decided that maybe after he had put this financing to bed, he ought to contact Rockwell, the owner of ADS, to learn of their interest in modems. Certainly Rockwell had the requisite semiconductor technology and if Codex was going to engineer LSI-modems, they would need a strategic partner for sourcing the chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuhn Loeb, satisfied as to a future - or at least the reasonable possibility of a future - for modems, completed the prospectus and filed it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Proving the adage: “Never count a financing done until the cash is in the bank, “in 1972 the SEC informed Kuhn Loeb and Codex that since they had raised money in a private placement within the last twelve months, they could not now do a public financing. It violated a rule outlawing private placements in anticipation of a public offering. Since Codex traded over-the-counter, the whole matter was referred to a NASDAQ appeals board for resolution. Carr remembers pleading their case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, all BS aside, we have to do this public offering to finance that contract.  There is no conceivable way on God’s earth that we could have known we were going to be given this award, therefore we couldn’t have known we were going to do a public offering when we did the private placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals board adjourned after hearing Carr’s testimony and returned in a matter of minutes with the decision allowing Codex to proceed with the offering. On October 4, 1972, Codex raised $2,432,000 with a post-money valuation of $22.8 million. For fiscal year 1972, revenues totaled $4.0 million with a profit of $561,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex had achieved another important milestone.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

AT&amp;amp;T did not compete in the multiplexer market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1972, modem sales, exclusive of those of telephone companies, were estimated at $38 million and multiplexer sales at $21 million. (See Appendix 3.1 Data Communications Market) Total sales of $59 million were up more than six times those of 1968, or a compounded annual growth rate of 55%. Ninety-seven companies sold modems, only nineteen sold high-speed modems (4800 bps or higher). Nineteen companies sold TDM’s and twenty companies sold the older technology frequency division multiplexers (five companies sold both types of multiplexers). Twenty-two companies sold both modems and multiplexers. Frost and Sullivan, the market research firm whose estimates and information are used in this section, forecasted in 1972 that modem sales would peak in 1976 at $67 million and multiplexers would peak in 1977 at $75 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future would prove to be very different, however, for before 1988, modem sales would top $1 billion and multiplexer sales would exceed $500 million!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to 1972, the leading independent modem firm, Milgo, had sales of an estimated $12 million; or more than 25% of all modem sales and more than 50% of high-speed modem sales. Milgo did not compete in the multiplexer market, having ended its OEM relationship with Timeplex at year-end 1971. Milgo’s success stemmed from having a broad modem product line and a sales distribution strategy using manufacturing representatives rather that hiring its own sales force. Manufacturing representatives are independent organizations that sell the products of many manufacturers to end users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex had captured the role of technological leader with the introduction of its QAM-based 4800 bps and 9600 bps modems. Even so, since it declined to participate in the lower speed modem categories (for reasons of corporate credo), Codex would not overtake Milgo as market leader for many years. Codex was, however, the only company to innovate high-speed modems and TDM’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General DataComm joined Milgo and Codex as a public company in 1972. In that year, 70% of GDC’s sales would be to common carriers (telephone companies) and only 30% to end users.  Sales to Western Union would account for 42% of their sales. GDC had not yet broadened their product line to include modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timeplex’s sales for 1972 doubled those of 1971, and, in February 1973, Timeplex would become a public company. Infotron, Paradyne, Vadic, UDS and Intertel remained modest companies struggling to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADS, the early star of data communications, was firmly under the control of North American Rockwell by year-end 1972, and had an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies continued to compete. Ultronics had estimated sales of modems and multiplexers of $12 million. Western Union continued to be a purchaser of product used in its networks. Stelma’s sales persisted flat at roughly $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the great project war between AT&amp;amp;T and IBM heated up when IBM entered the market in December 1971 with a line of modems and communication processors. AT&amp;amp;T continued to dominate the market for computer terminals through its Teletype division of Western Electric. IBM was second to AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the effort to bring into being the Arpanet swung into full gear. BBN had won the right to build the IMPs that would be interconnected using leased lines from AT&amp;amp;T to create the communications network, or subnet. Now the many design issues left open had to be decided. Most importantly would be how packets would be routed through the subnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personnel from the Host sites had been meeting since mid-1968 to craft the host-to-host protocols that would function over the subnet yet, organizationally, they remained unsure of their role or how much authority they had to make decisions. No wonder, most were graduate students inexperienced with managing such a complex, unknown process. In February, BBN convened a meeting to discuss how this host software would communicate with the IMPs. Everyone left realizing just how much there was to do, and that so many questions remained unanswered. The meetings of the representatives soon assumed the formal name of the Networking Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBN delivered the first IMP to UCLA on schedule at the beginning of September. That same month, Robert Taylor left IPTO. Larry Roberts became the new Director, making Arpanet but one of his many projects, rather than his principal responsibility. Importantly, his expanded budgetary clout would help him persuade Host site personnel to make the network a priority - a clout very much needed for a network was not everyone’s vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts had other concerns. To make sense of how to expand the initial four-nodes into a cross-county network, he sought help from both new experts such as Howard Frank, and trusted friends such as Leonard Kleinrock. After months of testing, expansion began and pleasant surprises confirmed the value of having computers interconnected into a network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arpanet was not the only computer network experiment underway during the late 1960’s. Two others that would prove important were the NPL network under the leadership of Donald Davies in London and the ALOHAnet led by Norm Abramson in Honolulu. Both would have lasting impact on the history of computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-1971, Robert Kahn counseled a frustrated Roberts that a public demonstration needed to be staged to force Host site conversion to Arpanet. In October 1972, at the International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC), a hugely successful coming out party for Arpanet was held. The who’s who of computer communication attended and interacted, with many soon moving to new organizations and assuming new roles to lead the continued evolution of computer communications. It was a magical and exciting time, when a powerful new idea - packet switching - proved real and a torrent of activity and thinking was unleashed to reshape the way computers would communicate.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/6.1/The-Communications-Subnet-BBN-1969/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In January 1969, the BBN team began the painstaking tasks of fleshing out the design of the communications subnet. It had been agreed that the subnet would consist of minicomputer-based Interface Message Processors (IMPs) initially interconnected with leased telephone lines. Hosts would communicate with other Hosts by sending messages over the subnet. IMPs, in a process totally transparent to Hosts, routed a message by parsing it into up to eight packets with the destination IMP reassembling the packets into the message before delivering it to the intended Host. A message would consist of roughly 8000 bits, while a packet was limited to 1000 bits. Exactly how this was to work, reliably and error-free, was now the challenge. It was to be up to personnel at the Host sites to determine how sending messages rather than establishing circuits was to lead to a radically new means of communications between computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this architecture, a number of important issues remained to be specified; a routing mechanism, for example. The BBN response to the RFQ called somewhat vaguely for the “shortest-path routing, with certain metrics.” As Kahn recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had left the precise implementation open, because we knew it was an area we wanted to do more research. Paul Baran’s contributions to routing were very interesting, because they were among the first dynamic discussions of how you do routing. They were largely based on what he called “hot potato” routing. You have to understand where Paul was coming from. He was thinking of this kind of network as a survivable network from the point of view of military communications in the era of thermo-nuclear war. Herman Kahn had just written his book “On Thermo-nuclear War” which was getting everyone upset. So the military was looking for ways to deal with communications in very violent kinds of threat environments. I also think Paul was motivated almost entirely by voice considerations. If you look at what he wrote, he was talking about switches that were low-cost electronics. The idea of putting powerful computers in these locations hadn’t quite occurred to him as being cost effective. So the idea of computer switches was missing. The whole notion of protocols didn’t exist at that time. And the idea of computer-to-computer communications was really a secondary concern. What finally happened in networking was, in fact, very strongly derivative of what Baran was talking about, but he had not really laid a clear template for what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other issues that concerned Kahn, the principal architect, were congestion control, independence and deadlocks: How could the network be kept from being congested by too many packets? How do you build a system where each of the nodes would act independently of all the other nodes and still talk to each other without requiring global control? How to keep the network from coming to a grinding halt? The last concern, deadlocks, was more nebulous and became more “contentious.” Kahn believed this was an important issue, but was unable to convince anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after winning the contract, BBN received notice the project specification had changed: each IMP had to accommodate the connection of up to four host computers, not just one. This change was significant and concerned BBN, for if the specification was subject to change, how would they ever complete the project on time? Roberts and Heart began meeting regularly. Roberts was concerned about the schedule as well, for if the host sites did not take it seriously, it would be difficult to motivate them to make the project the priority Roberts felt necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and Frank Heart benefited from being from organizations that gave managers the “room to make it happen.” For when they made a decision, that was the decision. No other approval was needed. The high level of trust and integrity between the two organizations - grounded in the relationships among the many individuals who had been members of not only ARPA and BBN but also MIT and Lincoln Labs - facilitated project management. Roberts and Heart knew each other and knew they would likely be working with each other in the future. These cultural and organizational attributions became critical as Roberts and Heart pushed to complete the Subnet on schedule. Heart opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Larry at his level in ARPA, was very much in charge. Almost nobody was looking over his shoulder closely and, at BBN, I was a free agent. There was nobody looking over my shoulder either. So projects like this that are this hard, it’s very critical not to have too much back seat driving, and that’s one of the things about this project that was very unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","next" : "/section/6.2/Host-to-Host-Software-The-Network-Working-Group-1968-1969/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Roberts never questioned that each site would have to connect its computer to the subnet. For to convince sites that an outside contractor would be responsible for software residing on “their” computers was a thought so top-down as to undo the very heart of ARPA logic, that is, hire the best and leave them alone. He needed the Arpanet to be seen as the users’ creation, not a straightjacket imposed from on high. Thus the Host sites had to create the architecture and software that would make the Arpanet a functioning network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So concurrent with the release of the RFQ in June 1968, Roberts asked Elmer Shapiro of SRI to organize representatives from the initial four sites to begin working on the host-to-host issues. Shapiro chaired the first meeting of site representatives in early July 1968. This meeting began a process that would become even more problematic than the subnet development. Steve Crocker, who attended as the representative of UCLA, remembers:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first meeting was seminal. We had lots of questions – how IMP’s and hosts would be connected, what hosts would say to each other, and what applications would be supported. No one had any answers, but the prospects seemed exciting. We found ourselves imagining all kinds of possibilities – interactive graphics, cooperating processes, automatic data base query, electronic mail  – but no one knew where to begin. We weren’t sure whether there was really someone from the east that would be along by and by to bring the word. But we did come to one conclusion: We ought to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Taylor initiated an annual meeting of graduate students working on ARPA contracts, a meeting similar to the annual principal investigators conference. The first meeting was held in July 1968 at the University of Illinois, shortly after the Shapiro meeting, and was chaired by Barry Wessler, Roberts’ assistant since early 1968. Crocker attended as the MIT representative, and Alan Kay and John Warnock - not Steve Carr - showed up from Utah. Vinton (Vint) Cerf, a high school buddy of Crocker’s who had worked for IBM and was now in the Ph.D. program at UCLA, represented UCLA. Crocker recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Barry Wessler kept trying to get us interested as a group in this network, and the group’s reaction was not very positive. It wasn’t negative. There was no protest, but he wanted us to think about the issues of file sharing and some of those kinds of issues. We were all interested in artificial intelligence and graphics systems and other topics that were hot at the time, and there wasn’t a lot of response. It just sort of fell flat. So, the one thing that was true was that the community was not keenly involved in networking, and not really responsive. On the other hand, ARPA was pushing it and it was a serious vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the summer and fall of 1968, Crocker, Carr and Jeff Rulifson began meeting as Arpanet site representatives. Crocker remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We didn’t have a charter. There wasn’t any agenda. There wasn’t any mandate to go forward. There wasn’t any organization imposed. There wasn’t even any authority to do anything. We had been told, basically, that these IMP’s were coming and we would get connected, and that was all the structure there was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1969, Heart convened a meeting of site representatives at BBN to begin the process of educating the sites about the IMPs, so they would be ready to connect to them when they were installed later in the year. Crocker, Carr and Rulifson attended hoping to be told “what to do.” Crocker remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t think any of us were prepared for that meeting. The BBN folks, led by Frank Heart, Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein and Will Crowther, found themselves talking to a crew of graduate students they hadn’t anticipated. And we found ourselves talking to people whose first concern was how to get bits to flow quickly and reliably but hadn’t – of course – spent any time considering above the link level.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBN concluded that they had to provide information to the host sites if they were to develop the hardware and software needed to interface to the IMPs. Kahn assumed responsibility for creating a document specifying the IMP interface, a document to become BBN Document #1822.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the February meeting, Crocker, Carr and Rulifson realized that they were the leaders. If the sites were going to connect to the Subnet, they had to make some decisions and get to work. At their March meeting, they decided to begin documenting their conversations, not as formal minutes but as notes, a trail of thoughts, to which they gave the name Request for Comments. Crocker, who had become de-facto chairman of the small group of site representatives, submitted the first Request For Comment: RFC 1 - Host Software, on April 7, 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In RFC-1, Crocker described how the IMP software worked and its implications for Host software. Significantly, he described that when a Host wanted to initiate a connection with another Host, it did so by sending a link code that the IMP would use to establish a link with the intended Host. A second message could not be sent over an established link without receiving an RFNM (Request for Next Message). Each Host would have only so many links, and would have a limited number of links with each other Host. The creation of connections using links was tantamount to establishing virtual circuits between Hosts. Hence, while the subnet functioned by routing packets, Host connections functioned by sending messages over virtual circuits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; This distinction and its implications would embroil the computer communication community for over a decade and is, therefore, central to this history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point Crocker made in the RFC was the desire for some host-to-host error checking. BBN made it clear that no checking was needed, as the subnet would provide sufficient error-correction. This assumption would prove insufficient and, combined with the fact that no host-to-host checking would be built-in, caused future problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1969, BBN distributed Document #1822 to the sites and their representatives. It defined the physical, link level and packet level interfaces to the IMPs. With only three months to go before the sites began receiving their IMPs, site personnel needed help. Heart recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BBN put a great deal of energy into helping the host sites. We not only wrote 1822, but we didn’t just go and leave it. We went and involved ourselves with every single site in those days, talked to the people designing the hardware and software, helped them over rough spots. We put a lot of energy into working on the host side of it. Even though we couldn’t do it ourselves, we were very heavily involved. So for us, the problem was getting those hosts on, and we wanted that to work, otherwise the network wouldn’t be used and it wouldn’t grow. It was an important issue, and of course ARPA also was very anxious to make it happen, and encouraged us to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The schedule called for UCLA to receive the first IMP from BBN since UCLA, under the supervision of Kleinrock, was creating the software and hardware needed to measure network performance. Since no network like the Arpanet had ever existed before, measuring its performance was crucial to understanding its operating characteristics and, by so doing, knowing when and how to expand the network without inducing catastrophic problems. In recognition of its critical role, UCLA became known as the Network Measurement Center or NMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a meeting on March 21, 1969, Kleinrock reviewed the goals and objectives of the Arpanet work at UCLA. The following are excerpts from a memo he distributed on April 25th documenting what had to be done and assigning responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To: ARPA Employees Working on COMPUTER NETWORK RESEARCH Project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Goals and ObjectivesOur point of departure is the stated objectives as quoted below in our proposal to ARPA:&quot;The main purpose of this contract shall be to engage in those activities which enable UCLA to participate as a viable, creative, and significant node in the ARPA experimental computer network. These activities include:    -implementation of hardware and software to couple the UCLA HOST to its IMP;    -research in the development and use of analytical and simulation models of computer networks and time-shared computer systems;    -development of software procedures for active participation in the initial and full ARPA net;    -develop software suitable for measuring those network parameters which allow one to understand network behavior, which allow control of network functions and which permit us to assess the validity of our mathematical and simulation models;    -carry out studies on the use of remote facilities in a network environment.&quot;These objectives fit into what I see as the medium term development of computer research here at UCLA. Broadly speaking, one of our goals is to create science and engineering out of the 'art' portion of the field. This technology will lead to the intelligent design and prediction of existing and new computer systems.&quot;Kleinrock ended the memo:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a busy few months ahead of us running into late fall 1969. The real burden does fall upon UCLA since we are the first node in the net and it is important that we carry out our responsibilities in this role successfully. Following the creation of this network will come ‘fun time.’ That is, the use of the network and its vast power and challenge will provide considerable diversity of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As NMC, UCLA’s responsibilities ranged from working with BBN to make sure the necessary measurement capabilities were designed into the IMPs, to providing constant network monitoring and analysis once the network was operational. Knowing Roberts wanted to expand the number of sites connected to Arpanet as quickly as possible, the NMC plan called for three months of tests with the first four IMP’s prior to network expansion. John Postel, another graduate student working with both Estrin and Kleinrock on measuring computer performance, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we threw away all this stuff about probing inside another computer and began to think about how to measure networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his role in the group defining the host-to-host software, Crocker managed UCLA’s site preparation. The hardware needed to connect their computer(s) to the IMP was a high priority. Crocker looked into having an outside contractor build the connection, but a bid of $19,000 and six months prompted him to give the job to Mike Wingfield, a graduate student, who had a prototype working in less than six weeks for $4,000. The first IMP interface was a “box about a foot cube, maybe a little bigger, and elegant.” Crocker soon wished everything else were proceeding as smoothly. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, we were having a little trouble with the software. No big surprise, getting our software ready, and I knew that BBN was struggling with some subtle timing problem in the IMP’s and they were real worried about whether they were going to make their deadline. I looked at the calendar and I said: ‘Oh well, September 1 is Labor Day. There’s no problem, because that’s a holiday, that’s Monday.’ So I reasoned like this, I said: ‘First of all, BBN is running late. Second of all, September 1st is a holiday, so it’ll slip sometime after that. They’ll ship it out here and Honeywell will come in and try to get the machine working, and then BBN will send out a team and see if they can get their software working on top of that, so I’ve got an easy two weeks minimum.’ BBN fixed their problem, looked at the calendar and said: ‘We’re not going to miss the first date. Air ship the thing,’ and it wound up on our loading dock on Saturday, the end of August, and on the same day somebody showed up and wheeled it in and plugged it in and the program kept running from when they had unplugged it, and they had a working IMP. So all the reasons why I thought I had two weeks collapsed to about minus two days, and there it was. That was a bad day. So that was September, 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kleinrock too recalls the timely arrival of their IMP:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, to BBN’s credit, they connected this thing up, and that day we had bits moving back and forth. I think the next day we had packets moving back and forth and messages worked. It came in and the damned thing worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A milestone, one that even weeks earlier had seemed out of reach, had been achieved. BBN delivered the second IMP to SRI in early October, and UCSB and the University of Utah received theirs in November and December, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/6.4/IPTO-Management-Changes-1969/",

The transition proved seamless, as Roberts had by then already been given most of his new responsibilities. However, with each new responsibility, he was challenged to make time available for Arpanet. His solutions: to assign some of the Arpanet workload to Wessler and simply work more hours himself. A person less competent, committed, or able to maintain such a punishing schedule, would have had to concede active involvement with Arpanet. But not Roberts. In fact, the additional authority and budget power that came with the directorship gave Roberts even more clout to command the attention and cooperation of the sites connecting to the Arpanet - leverage that would become critical as Roberts pushed to get Arpanet not only up and running, but indispensable to the fabric of the ARPA community.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/6.5/Host-to-Host-Software-1970/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The host-to-host group kept growing in members as more sites began to take connecting to the Arpanet seriously. While a core group of graduate students and computer scientists met irregularly, nearly one hundred participants attended bi-annual meetings held on the east and west coast, These meetings were marked by serious arguments, some so heated that the only way to be heard was to shout down the objections of others, as members struggled to come to grip with what they were doing and not doing. There were no answers and even the questions sometimes eluded coherent articulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crocker recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We wanted a generic underpinning, but we didn’t know quite how to get there. We were struggling with it, so the first design we came up with, which we were by this time under some pressure to have, was a specialized design that would allow you to log-in from one place to another, but that was pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tension within the host-to-host group, between creating functional software and the desire to do something special and unique, surfaces in RFC 1000 of 1969: “With the pressure to get something working and the general confusion as to how to achieve the high generality we all aspired to, we punted and defined the first set of protocols to include only remote terminal and file transfer. In particular, only asymmetric, user-server relationships were supported.” The host-to-host group had settled for connecting remote terminals to computers and transferring files - the same application that had frustrated Roberts in his 1966 experiment at Lincoln Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 21, when Roberts and Wessler witnessed an initial demonstration of the protocol software by the host-to-host group at UCLA, Roberts could not hide his disappointment. He knew that to win support from reluctant sites for an expanded network would require more functionality than simply logging onto computers at other sites; particularly for those already having computers to log onto. Remote log-in was not a sufficiently compelling application. He had to create a sense of urgency, and more ambitious goals, if the network was to become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early December 1969, Roberts met with the host-to-host group in Utah and expressed his dissatisfaction with what had been accomplished and challenged them to be more aggressive. Again from RFC 1000:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Larry made it abundantly clear that our first step was not big enough, and we went back to the drawing board. Over the next few months we designed a symmetric host-to-host protocol, and we defined an abstract implementation of the protocol known as the Network Control Program. (“NCP” later came to be used as the name for the protocol, but it originally meant the program within the operating system that managed connections. The protocol itself was know blandly only as the host-host protocol.) Along with the basic host-host protocol, we also envisioned a hierarchy of protocols, with Telnet, FTP and some splinter protocols as the first examples. (See Diagram 6.5.0 Layered Relationships of the Arpanet Protocols.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagram-650-layered-relationships-of-the-arpanet-protocols&quot;&gt;Diagram 6.5.0 Layered Relationships of the Arpanet Protocols.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_6.5.0_Arpanet_protocols.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Arpanet Protocol Layers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crocker remembers the problem of overcoming the master/slave model of computer communications and the need for layering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the things that was very awkward was up until that time, if you looked at the design of an operating system in a computer, the view implicit in the design was that the operating system was the center of the world, and anything that was attached to the computer was a slave device. You could attach tapes and disks and card readers and printers and so forth, but the initiative was in the computer, and it would say when to talk or when to listen to those things. You try to connect two such devices together, two computers together, and they only know how to talk to each other as if one is the master. Well, if one is the master, then the other must be the slave. We knew that we wanted a much more flexible vision in which the initiative could be at either site, and there would be a coordinated or cooperative model of communications. But the applications that first come to mind, being able to remotely log-in to another thing or to move a file or do remote job entry, all are back in the master/slave model. We wanted those to be special cases, rather than being the only thing you could work with. So we knew that if we put those in as your basic model, that more ambitious things would always be fighting against those kind of things; the business of being able to download a program, of being able to have one machine act as a surrogate for another. So a general-purpose interprocess communication facility was definitely needed, and then you’d build things up on that. We knew we needed layers, but having a number wasn’t important. The fact was that things were built on top of each other, that you had the least commitment at a certain level and then you could build on top of that. Then all of the advanced ideas about how to get computers to cooperate on various tasks could be implemented. Those were the days when, instead of viewing the network as an electronic mail system, which was kind of an afterthought in a way, there were all these visions of shared databases and load balancing, or jobs would be shifted from one machine to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 1970, the host-to-host group (that had begun as a few graduate students meeting and freewheeling about how the Arpanet might be used) had evolved to a network of over one hundred participants confronting the need to make Arpanet functional without perpetuating modes of computer communications confining the future by the constraints of the past. The need for more formality included recognizing the importance of the host-to-host group. This prompted a name change to the Network Working Group (NWG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicative of the growing awareness of the Arpanet was the involvement of Robert Metcalfe with NWG in 1970. Metcalfe, a graduate student at Harvard looking for a topic for his Ph.D. and a job to make some money, had a friend on the MIT Project MAC offer him a position building memory or working on connecting computers to the Arpanet. Having been told that networking was “hot” as ARPA was pumping a lot of money into it, Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I said: ‘Network,’ but I didn’t know what a network was. I had no idea what a network was!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe then learned that ARPA had given Harvard money to connect their PDP-10 to the Arpanet, only they had no one to do it. Metcalfe said he could do it but Harvard was reluctant to turn the project over to an enthusiastic graduate student. Not one to be discouraged, Metcalfe crafted a clever solution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I went back to MIT and did some wheeling and dealing. I got them to agree that I would, as an employee of MIT, connect their PDP10 to the network and MIT would give Harvard a copy of what I built. I went back to Harvard and I said: ‘Have I got a deal for you!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvard still said no and turned the project over to BBN who in turn turned it over to another graduate student at Harvard. The indomitable Metcalfe began attending host-to-host meetings as a representative from MIT. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Computer Research Lab needed someone to do the networking software for their node of the network. So they said: ‘How would you like to do that?’ I said: ‘Fine.’ And I started going to these meetings which were led by Steve Crocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","next" : "/section/6.6/Network-Topology-1969-1970/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;During the summer and fall of 1969, Roberts struggled with the issue of network topology: the interconnection of nodes, or sites. Based on his prior experience with the telephone companies, he knew he had to order the communication lines well in advance of when they would be needed. So he began simulating network topologies on a computer and quickly concluding he needed expert help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-650-larry-roberts-early-design-sketch-of-arpanet-topology&quot;&gt;Exhibit 6.5.0 Larry Roberts’ early design sketch of Arpanet Topology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-6.6.0_roberts_arpanet_sketch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of T-1 circuit with channel banks&quot; /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts turned to Dr. Howard (Howie) Frank. Frank had founded Network Analysis Corporation (NAC), a company specializing in topological design based on his groundbreaking work at the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP). Frank remembers Roberts’ call requesting a meeting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Arpanet was a four node network. That’s what existed. He had a piece of graph paper on his desk and he was showing me extensions to the network. It was on the west coast at the time. But there was nothing on the east coast. He needed to order communication lines for that, and he said: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m just drawing these lines. Could you figure out a way to do this better?’ So, we wrote him a proposal, and we started our contract in October 1969. Larry had a deadline. It was a real deadline. He said: ‘ I can cancel the orders by this date.’ We analyzed the configuration that he had given us, and we developed the very first techniques for designing distributed computing systems, which were primitive compared to the ones we subsequently developed. I would say that within a period of two to three months – no more than that – we came back with a design which was something like 25% cheaper and had 40% more throughput than the one that he had come up with. We worked like a bear because it was truly a hard project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank and Kleinrock shared an interest in network design, although each looked at the problem from a different perspective. Just months before receiving his Ph.D. from Northwestern, a classmate told Frank: “Your thesis is in the book store.” Frank recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I charged over to the book store, and there I find a monograph by Len called On Communication Networks, Stochastic Message Flow and Delay. My thesis was titled On Probabilistic Graphs of Some Applications. So I open it up, and I look through it for three minutes, and discover it has nothing to do with what I’m doing. It’s the same general area, but he was looking at queues and networks and I was looking at the existence of the fundamental structures themselves. Essentially he was pumping traffic through and seeing what happens to the traffic. I was saying: ‘There is an underlying uncertainty in the network itself.’ Kleinrock used words like capacity, but really that’s not a deterministic quantity. The links may not be there because of reliability or vulnerability. Somebody may be attacking them or the nodes may not be there, and I was looking at the fundamental phenomenon of how do you talk about connectivity when the elements are uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Frank wrote a paper stimulated by Baran’s article On Distributed Communications and an article in the Journal of Mathematical Biophysics on what happens to human cells when they are radiated. In seeing the commonalties with Baran’s networks disrupted by nuclear bombardment, Frank developed a series of equations that reproduced everything Baran had done by simulation. The paper, Vulnerability of Communication Networks, published in the IEEE Transactions On Communication Technology in 1967, led to Frank being offered the position at the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP). The paper investigated how the Federal Power Commission approved Gulf of Mexico pipeline applications and Frank developed new techniques that proved valuable in finding solutions for expanding the Arpanet.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In December 1969, after all four IMPs had been installed; the Network Measurement Center (NMC) under the direction of Kleinrock began generating weird configurations of data traffic with artificial traffic generators in both the IMPs and Hosts in order to stress the Subnet to bring it to its knees; to stop it from functioning. This role put the NMC on a collision course with BBN since BBN had to correct the problems. Kahn of BBN had concerns of his own, especially regarding potential “deadlocks,” when the network simply froze and would not function. In December, he paid a visit to NMC and remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The very first test I ran on the net was a deadlock test. We deadlocked it. Dave Walden worked with me on the experiment and got to see it happen. I think it was six months later before everybody else sort of gradually came along to really understand the implications. It was a very frustrating time, because I couldn’t convey that notion to anybody else despite the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, a long lasting professional and personal friendship began between Kahn and Cerf began. Cerf remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The whole system was largely Bob’s architecture, and he came out to UCLA to go and find out, by kicking the tires, how this thing would really perform. He had some theories about places where it would break that not everyone agreed with him about, but he said he was going to go and prove that it would break in certain ways by generating traffic at UCLA and forcing it through this four node network in various and sundry ways. So, he and I worked together, me doing the traffic generation and measurement software and he was figuring out what experiments to perform for three or four weeks at UCLA. That’s a collaboration that has gone on ever since!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects, BBN became the new AT&amp;amp;T - seemingly indifferent to the users of the network. But from BBN’s perspective, their objective remained to satisfy their client, Roberts, and to assure a working network. Not to be concerned with every little problem arising from perverse network testing. Kleinrock recalls telling BBN:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the early days, when they came out with their proposal, we looked in their routing algorithm, which we were very interested in, and said: ‘This thing has loops. A packet can go back and forth, or in a circle.’ And they said: ‘No, there are no loops.’ But there are loops! They said: ‘No.’ So we simulated them and said: ‘Look, there’s loops.’ They said: ‘There are no loops.’ Then this four node network was implemented and we showed them loops, and the answer was; ‘Yes, there are loops.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This early work led to a new understanding of the phenomenological behavior of networks. Kleinrock explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You give me a network and I can analyze it’s performance in a very simple way. We developed exact mathematical formulas as well as approximations to understand networks. We also proved that measurement was very important. We were able to demonstrate deadlocks and degradation’s and explain what was causing them. We found that the whole issue of flow control was a key issue. For example, problems of sequencing, the keeping of things in order, causes deadlocks. The function of flow control is to make things move smoothly. If you want to do that, you put in controls. Once you put in controls, that’s called a constraint. If the network can’t meet the constraint, it crashes. So the thing you put in to help out is the thing that kills you, or degrades performance. We had a whole catalog of degradation’s and deadlocks which BBN eventually fixed. Those things are still present in every network today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite lingering problems and differences of opinion, the network worked. By June 1970, the network included SDC and RAND on the west coast, and BBN, MIT and Harvard on the east coast. All the while, network performance testing continued uncovering problems, most of which would be corrected, including some thought intractable.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  By mid-year, a rudimentary version of the Network Control Center was established at BBN.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;  Four more nodes were added by the end of the year: Stanford, Lincoln Labs, Carnegie Mellon and Case Western.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Great promise, modest functionality and pleasant surprises marked the early days of Arpanet. The vision of distributed computing as users and programs utilizing multiple, distributed, concurrent resources, be they other programs or simply computer cycles, remained just promise. The lack of host-to-host protocols, the foundations on which the higher level functions of distributed computing were to be built, limited network functionality. In fact, the only real application remained a primitive version of remote log-in. While instructive, remote log-in did not qualify as a major accomplishment. Even so, early surprises proved the value of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first surprise was that a user could switch terminal connections between local computers connected to the IMP simply by issuing a command to the IMP. Most terminal traffic never accessed the Subnet but stayed within host IMPs. (See Diagram 4.5 - Intra-IMP Traffic.) Easily switching a terminal connection between local computers was a great benefit to those needed access to multiple computers and reflected the need that would a decade later give rise to networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagram-680----intra-imp-traffic&quot;&gt;Diagram 6.8.0  - Intra-IMP Traffic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_6.8.0_Intra-IMP_traffic.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Intra-IMP traffic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second surprise was that network users were not frustrated by the lack of functionality; for that is all they wanted - terminal access to remote computers. Roberts remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What I had first expected was that traffic would be computer to computer; it would be transfer of software, the remote use of software, the interaction between machines – that people would be on their own machine doing something and they would need another machine for cycles of something. But it turned out that most people just used the network as an individual terminal on the other machine as a remote terminal. The concept of distributed computing was a future concept in a lot of respects, and the short term need was for a much better communication system to get people to their remote computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply providing terminal access to the Arpanet motivated the innovation of a second type of IMP – the Terminal Interface Processor, or TIP. (See Diagram 4.6 The Terminal Interface Processor.) The advantage of TIPs was that terminals could connect directly to the network via the TIPs without having to connect to terminal ports on a computer to effect network connection. Since computer terminal ports were limited and expensive, tying them up with terminals solely needing network connection was wasteful. Once available, TIPs gave sites without computers access to the Arpanet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagram-681-the-terminal-interface-processor&quot;&gt;Diagram 6.8.1 The Terminal Interface Processor.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_6.8.0_Terminal_Interface_Processor.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Terminal Interface Processor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBN received the contract to develop a TIP in mid-1970 and delivered the first TIP in August 1971. Kahn recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The TIP was a big deal, because now suddenly here you had an IMP, and the question was, how could you hook up these terminals to it. And in fact what we did back then was a mistake necessitated by the economics of the situation. The first IMP’s used 16k of memory. But you could put 32k of memory in the machine. So we used the bottom 16k for the IMP and we use the top 16k for the TIP. The TIP was an IMP that at the front-end was a multiplexer that would allow you to take all these terminals and multiplex them into memory. So that’s really what the TIP was. It was a bunch of software that got written in 16k of memory, plus this multiplexer which we called, at the time, the multi-line controller; that was designed by Severo Ornstein. The TIP connected up to sixty-three terminals to the network. With the TIP, the ARPANET took-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest surprise by far, however, was electronic mail, or email. While Roberts believed electronic mail would be an important network application, it never appeared in any of the original specifications, and most admit to being completely surprised. Kahn recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was email traffic, that was really the dominant traffic pattern. There was a lot of early experimentation, moving graphics back and forth. But in terms of total number of actions people took, there was probably more electronic mail activity, even though some of the other activities probably transmitted more bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, email consisted simply of a message from one person to another person. But as use grew, the pressure for additional functionality cried out for innovation. Roberts coded one of the first improvements: a “TECO hack” that allowed a user to select which message to read rather than being forced to read messages only in the order received. (TECO (Text Editor and Corrector) was an early editor language. Hack refers to an innovative, yet largely unsupported software program, and is generally a term of respect.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Lynch, who becomes important later, asserts that Ray Tomlinson and Dan Murphy, both of BBN and authors of TENEX, wrote the original Email program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tomlinson and Murphy created Email because they had a PDP10 to themselves to do development of TENEX. They had one machine, a BIG thing, right. Two guys, one machine, and they worked in shifts, I mean they basically worked twelve hours. Twelve on, twelve off, and sometimes they’d overlap, physically, and sometimes they wouldn’t. As soon as they got the file system to the point were it actually would stay together, they started writing notes to each other and leaving them in a place on the disk, and, you know: ‘I did this. This now works.’ Just little notes back and forth and it kept the history. When they reached the point where they had to interface the system to the Arpanet, they said: ‘Oh, well, let’s do it so it works from one machine to another.’ They made that leap because they were writing the network code as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email represented a new mode of interaction and communications: convenient, able to be left by the originator and picked up by the receiver at their convenience, and one did not have to respond immediately to a comment but rather could first give it thought. From the start, email was an informal mode of communication. No one worried about typos or structure. Communications that were short and to the point mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even though Arpanet did not initially represent the new paradigm of distributed computing envisioned by Roberts, it made possible a digital community of computer scientists and, with time other users, and, most importantly, it proved packet switching worked.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/6.9/Host-to-Host-Software-The-Network-Control-Program-1970-1971/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Distributed computing over the Arpanet required the communication protocols being created by a very bogged down NWG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The March 1970 NWG meeting at UCLA began with a presentation of the host-to-host protocols and highlighted the critical open issue of how to pass a connection from one computer to another? A heated discussion followed. Crocker and the members of the NWG, who now had been attending meetings for two years, believed in distributed computing: processes or programs executing in one computer should be able to pass connections automatically to another computer. One computer might serve as the log-in center, for example, to perform authentication and security before granting users access to the system. Once authenticated, the log-in computer would then connect users to their requested computer instantly. While seemingly a simple task, in a network consisting of a large number of computers and users, the complexity of assuring error free connections was significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crocker had modeled his thoughts on his understanding of the Multics operating system developed at MIT, and believed having some Multics experts at the meeting would facilitate the discussion. Crocker recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was a lot of controversy over this (reconnection feature), because it was somewhat more complicated than the other parts of the protocol. There was some resistance, and the Multics’ people, surprisingly, were the most resistant. They said we couldn’t implement things like this, saying that many of the ideas in the protocol I had thought were Multics-like, where we had sort of taken Multics as the role model for what a real multi-purpose, multi-user computer was, were too complicated. As it turned out there were pragmatic issues about who was allowed to program at which levels within the Multics group, and the people assigned to the NWG were locked out of the lower levels.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The institutional uncertainty felt by members of the NWG regarding their role and authority complicated the creation of the host-to-host protocols, especially for Crocker whose role had yet to be formally recognized. Crocker hesitated to raise these issues with Roberts, sensitive to being only a graduate student. He believed Roberts had more important priorities. Adding further confusion, Crocker thought he reported to Kleinrock. But since the issues of the NWG were not Kleinrock’s concern, and Kleinrock had other pressing matters, Crocker remained largely unmanaged. This lack of management accountability exacerbated the tendency of an inexperienced, creative engineer to seek a better solution at the expense of task completion, and Crocker proved no exception. Against this ambiguous formal structure was set the resistance of the ARPA sites to the whole undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crucial meeting of the NWG in Atlantic City in May 1970 did little to resolve the uncertainty of the group.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Crocker asked Roberts how official was the NWG and his role. Crocker recalls Roberts telling him in front of others: “Well, what’s your problem. You’re in charge.” Problem resolution ARPA style. At the same time, the papers presented at the meeting revealed the deep and innovative thinking that was developing within the group. The presentations included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Computer Network Development to Achieve Resource Sharing: Roberts and Wessler&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The Interface Message Processor for the ARPA Computer Network: Heart, Kahn, Ornstein, Crowther and Walden&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Analytic and Simulation Methods in Computer Network Design: Kleinrock&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Topological Considerations in the Design of the ARPA Computer Network: Frank, Frisch and Chou&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Host-Host Communication Protocol in the ARPA Network: Carr, Crocker and Cerf&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crocker remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember Frank Heart put up some diagram that had sort of the spectrum of the problem and the host-to-host protocols were a thin little sliver on one end and the data communications, the long distant telephone lines were the other thin sliver, and the IMP’s solved this problem that was really right in the middle. I remember looking at it and: ‘Well, that’s your point of view.’ From my point of view, all that lower level stuff was the bottom layer and then we had this vast territory to try to untangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1970, NWG members convened at UCLA and Harvard to finalize the protocols and address the issues of implementation. The problem of reconnection continued to defy solution however. A frustrated Crocker sought advice from Crowther, the senior software designer on the BBN team. Crocker remembers the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He said: ‘Why don’t you just, with respect to the issue of detecting if the next host might be trying to do the same thing at the same time, why don’t you just have the hosts send their message, and if it gets to the next host and the next host is already trying to reconnect, what we called the reconnection protocol, then it would just reply negatively, or it would just forget about it. And if you didn’t get a reply, you would just try again, and eventually, somebody would succeed.’  I was astounded! I was just shocked, not in the negative sense, but I just couldn’t imagine where an idea like that would come from, because it was statistically based, and it wasn’t the way I thought about things. I thought about things as interlocking puzzles, and you get all the pieces to fit exactly right, and the idea of a statistical process, which is pretty easy to see that it had a high chance of converging very rapidly, so it wasn’t a problem, but it just wasn’t the way I thought about software at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As meetings continued without resolution, Crocker began receiving direction. On August 5th, Wessler visited Crocker and finally gave him a direct order: “This is not going well, drop that portion of the protocol.” Later in August, Crocker visited ARPA and Roberts offered him a job at IPTO. During the year it took to finalize the terms of his employment, Crocker continued to run the NWG. To assist sites that had not yet interfaced their computers to the Arpanet, he organized a team of facilitators, including Postel and Metcalfe, to provide expert help on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough came in mid-February 1971 at a meeting at the University of Illinois. A subcommittee known as the “host-to-host protocol glitch cleaning committee” was formed to write an interim report. They essentially settled the design of the host-to-host protocol.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; But documenting the protocols so that user sites could code and implement the protocols was a very different matter: documentation had yet to be completed and implementation could take a very long time. The ever-impatient Roberts wanted sites to finish their implementations as soon as possible and become active involved Arpanet nodes. To eliminate the impasse of documentation, at the NWG meeting in May 1971, Alex McKenzie, of BBN, “took on the task of writing a definitive specification of the host-to-host protocol – not to invent new protocol, but to write down what had been decided.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; With this document, each site could then begin creating the computer code needed for their computer(s) to communicate with other computers connected to the network.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

The coming into being of ALOHANET began in 1966 when Norm Abramson joined the faculty of the engineering department of the University of Hawaii. He thought he was taking a “big gamble,” for although he would be able to continue his engineering research, he was giving up the intellectual stimulation of Harvard and Stanford where he had spent the last seven years. In addition, he had the challenge of finding his own funding. Then fate smiled on Abramson as he found funding that would lead to his making a permanent contribution to the development of network technologies with his radio packet switched network: ALOHANET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning of a newly created ARPA program named THEMIS – whose mission was to support research at “second tier” universities – Abramson and two of his fellow professors, Wes Peterson and Ned Weldon, joined forces to create a team with both communications and computer background. Abramson recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we cast about for a research topic that we thought would make sense to the Department of Defense, that we would be interested in, and said: ‘Well, communications for computers makes sense.’ The telephone system appeared not to make sense at that time, especially in Hawaii, and we thought we had something that was intellectually stimulating and a package that we could sell to ARPA. That’s how it all started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Abramson arranged through a mutual friend a meeting with Bob Taylor, Director of IPTO. Only when asked precisely what they wanted to do, Abramson could do little more than shrug. In another meeting in 1969, Abramson remembers telling Taylor and Roberts that the constraint of one communication channel per user in radio communications seemed unduly limiting. When again pressed for an alternative, Abramson could only express the frustration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Something much more sensible for radio can be done here than assigning a single channel for every user in the network. That’s crazy. That won’t work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where one person’s ideas began and ended is now a blur. What is clear is that at a meeting held later in 1969, without the participation of Talyor or Roberts, the important decision to directly transmit user information in a single high speed packet burst, now known as an ALOHA channel, was made. That is, every terminal would transmit its data to the host using the same radio channel. If collisions occurred, a terminal would not receive an acknowledgment and would re-transmit. No terminal had its own dedicated broadcast channel: all terminals would use the same channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a paper written in 1985 by Norman Abramson:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the beginning it was clear that the nature of the radio channel provided new system design options not available in systems using conventional point-to-point telephone channels. As the network planning proceeded, this key point assumed greater and greater significance. It would be gratifying to be able to report that this key difference between radio channels, with broadcasting or multiple access capabilities, and conventional point-to-point wire (or microwave) channels was appreciated as we began the project. Unfortunately, such an appreciation developed among the members of the project only with time; as is the case in many real-world situations, our foresight was not as clear as our hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even at the beginning of the project, however, it was understood that the intermittent operation typical of interactive computer terminals was a convincing argument against the assignment of point-to-point channels in a conventional frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) or time-division multiple access (TDMA) manner. Some form of sharing of a common communication channel resource appeared necessary.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again the intermittent operation of interactive computer terminals was causing communication system architects to rethink how to construct a data communications network. But what a preposterous notion - that all terminals share the same channel simultaneously!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next came the construction of a demonstration network to prove feasibility. Two graduate students under the supervision of Abramson, Charlie Bass and John Davidson, both of whom will become important to the history of computer communications, gained important experience working on ALOHANET. Maybe the most unlikely source of help, considering the demands on his time, was Roberts himself. Abramson writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to this financial support of the ALOHANET, Roberts also contributed to the success of the project in a way not ordinarily obtained from funding agencies. In a real sense, Roberts acted as another member of the research staff of the project, contributing a number of major technical results (including the first derivation of the capacity of the slotted ALOHA channel and the first analysis of the capture effect in ALOHA channels).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALOHANET consisted of a number of remote terminal sites all connected by radio channels to a host computer at the University of Hawaii. It was a centralized, star topology with no channels having multiple hops. All users transmitted on one frequency and received on another frequency that precluded users from ever communicating with each other – users expected to receive transmissions on a different frequency than the one other users transmitted on. At its peak, ALOHANET supported forty users at several locations on the islands of Oahu and Maui. User terminals connected to the host computer via a terminal control unit (TCU) that communicated at 9600 bits per second. Following the installation of the first TCU in 1971, Abramson hosted a party celebrating their success. (In 1972, Abramson’s focus shifted to applying the concepts developed in ALOHANET to satellite channel communications. On December 17, 1972, an IMP connecting the ALOHA host to the ARPANET by satellite channel was installed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ALOHANET was never commercialized for to do so required dealing with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), the government agency that regulated the use of radio frequencies. Writes Abramson:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a research project, it was quite interesting, but to look further to operational or commercial systems was not something I would have given thought.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When Donald Davies became Superintendent of the Computer Science Division of the National Physics Laboratory in August 1966, he finally had the budgetary power to bring into being a network exploring the packet switching ideas for which he had been proselytizing. Davies would lead a very different effort than did Roberts. He explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We realized that we could never build an Arpanet. We had no mandate for building a nationwide network, and couldn’t imagine who would use it. We had nothing like ARPA to act as our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In searching for network design objectives, his team realized they had to look no further than a problem they confronted every day in their laboratory: How to provide common computer access for their growing proliferation of computer terminals? Their solution, a computer called an interface processor, was essentially a terminal multiplexer much like the TIPs of Arpanet. Only the NPL interface processor connected up to 512 terminals to a local computer at a combined data rate of up to one megabit per second.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the interface processor had been conceived, the NPL researchers questioned whether there might be more to gain than simply terminal connections. For as with all new “black boxes,” their existence opens up new possibilities, possibilities not contemplated in their original design. In the case of the interface processors, Davies’ group recognized that they could share more than just common terminal access. Davies remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main thing we found about small computers in those days, was that they had very good processing by the standards of the day, but they were very expensive when they came to adding some storage. It was expensive, because you had to add disk stores, which in those days were great big cabinets that cost you more than the computer itself. So what we said was that what we can do for all our mass of small minicomputers, PDP-8s and things around the laboratory, was provide them with a central storage facility, a file server, using the latest technology. So we built a file server to test this network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper delivered at an IFIP conference in Amsterdam in 1968, Davies discussed for the first time the concept of “local area networks;” the need for “local” computer-to-computer and terminal-to-computer interconnection. Again history will show that Davies had coined a phrase, much as he had earlier with “packet switching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the network first worked in 1971, the simple host-to-host protocol proved inadequate and had to be completely re-written in order to speed up packet transmission. Once the new protocol software was installed in 1973, the network handled over one million packets a day.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In mid-1971, a frustrated Roberts struggled with how to bring Arpanet into full operation. The lack of host-to-host protocols loomed as the largest problem. But other problems existed as well, such as convincing new sites to accelerate activities required to connect their computers to the network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;  While every site confronted similar problems, each site was also unique, and few acted with Roberts’ sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aware of Roberts’ frustration, Kahn suggested staging a public demonstration to motivate network completion. Roberts liked the idea and asked Kahn to manage the effort. Kahn agreed and recommended the demonstration be held at either a Spring or Fall Joint Computer Conference. Roberts, however, preferred a brand new conference, the International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC), to be held October 24-26, 1972 in Washington D. C. The persuasive Roberts prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From mid-1971 until the ICCC, Kahn spent virtually all of his time organizing the demonstration. He recruited Al Vezza of MIT’s Project MAC to help him, and they soon would involve others. The NWG contributed by holding a game, or “fly-off” at their Fall NWG meeting held at MIT. Crocker recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The game was: everybody was to try to log into everybody else’s host. So we had a big matrix and in the course of one or two days people were going to try to initiate a Telnet connection from their host to the other host, in both directions, because they are asymmetric when you get to that level. SDC distinguished themselves by being completely out of it and having nothing ready. Everything else kind of worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A milestone in computer-to-computer connectivity had been achieved. As expected, network improvements were needed to make the ICCC demonstration more effective, such a new remote log-in called Telnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICCC plan called for a TIP with a full compliment of computer terminals be installed at the Hilton Hotel in Washington D.C., the site of the ICCC. Interested conference participants could then log-on to one of the Arpanet Hosts and run an application on-line. That meant, however, that interesting practical applications, to be known as “scenarios,” had to be created and de-bugged or, if an application already existed, to make it network usable. Another task was to arrange for computer terminals to be installed and working. Kahn used this opportunity to convince terminal manufacturers to loan terminals to ARPA, and to help make sure they were configured to talk to the TIP. A third major task was to get the room ready for the demonstration including making arrangements with AT&amp;amp;T for the leased lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help Host sites connect their computers to Arpanet and create scenarios, Kahn organized a group of about 50 facilitators, including Cerf, Metcalfe, and Postel. This new group relieved the NWG of any continuing involvement for the demonstration, allowing it to focus its efforts on implementing higher-level protocols, including those needed for distributed computing applications. Around this same time, Crocker dramatically reduced the time he devoted to Arpanet, working instead on other ARPA projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Kahn asked Metcalfe to work with the NIC at SRI to document the working scenarios and create a manual for ICCC participants. Metcalfe spent two weeks at SRI pulling together 19 scenarios “to exhibit variety and sophistication, while retaining simplicity.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICCC would prove to be for packet switching what the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 was for the telephone: the public unveiling of a technological discontinuity. For the 800 computer communication professionals, government employees and academics attending the ICCC, seeing the TIP on a raised floor in the middle of the room with 36 connected computer terminals circled around it and dozens of ARPA scientists milling about, eager to show off their pride-and-joy, the scene must have seemed to many like a sideshow at some alien world’s carnival. And then to sit at a terminal, and with but a few key strokes be connected through a computer at UCLA to one at MIT and instantly be using an application, and then just as easily connect to any one of the other participating computers, the disorientation must have felt as if truly on that alien world – no wonder the most accessed scenario was weather conditions around Mother Earth. To most, a computer was a single machine safely stored in an air-conditioned, secured room. The idea of accessing computers around the country from a conference room in a Hilton Hotel was a capability simply unheard of. And as for the ARPA scientists, the bonds formed from staging the demonstration and living around the clock with their creation left them heady and optimistic about the computing future they were creating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahn has maybe the best perspective of the event:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was kind of a tour de force to actually make it happen. I forget which day of the week that the conference started on, but we didn’t actually have access to the room until something like 7:00 a. m. on the day it had to work. Now you have to imagine what it’s like building a whole computer installation when you have something like five or six hours to actually do it. People were going to show up in the room to use the network that afternoon. And so we had to lay the false floor and we had to get the long-distance telephone lines, get all the terminals installed and do that all in the compact space of six hours. It worked like a charm. It was just all ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The TIP was right in the middle of the ballroom and it was on a raised floor. We had ramps all around it to get people in and out and to handle the cabling. It was structured so that people could walk through the ballroom and see all the demo’s. People could sit down at the terminals, and they’d pick a scenario and they’d do it. There were booths on the sides as well as in the center. Each of the booths had somebody assigned to them and then people responsible for regions of the ballroom, like Bob Metcalfe, Vint Cerf or Jon Postel. They would kind of roam around and just help out wherever they were needed. There were probably at least thirty people involved. We also had demos outside the ballroom, staff at the doors, and we had a separate room where we were showing a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the first couple of days when it was up and running before the conference started – all these network experts were there trying to get their demos to work. When you’ve got a hundred or so of the best computer people in the country and they’re all in one room, any question that you want to ask can probably be answered by somebody in that room. People weren’t leaving the room until well after midnight every night. I mean, nobody wanted to leave that room. If we didn’t decide to shut the doors and lock it up, they might have stayed there all night for a whole week. Then at the end we just tore it down without ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe remembers an incident:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They gave me the job of escorting ten AT&amp;amp;T vice-presidents around. So I was demo’ing the system, and for the only time in that whole show, the TIP crashed.  The only time. It went down for about ten or twenty seconds. It finally came back up again. We reestablished connection and it never went down again. But this was a very enlightening moment for me because when I looked up, you know, they were happy that it crashed. They made no point of hiding their joy. Because this confirmed for them that circuit switching was better and more reliable than packet switching, which was flaky and would never work. And I had been working on this for two or three years, and it really pissed me off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davies attended the ICCC and remembers the impact of seeing everyone gathered together:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Arpanet was key because it demonstrated the concepts of packet switching on a large scale. The ICCC meeting in Washington D. C. was absolutely crucial because, for the first time, you could see a large community of people all working together. That was a watershed, because that was the first time that you had lots of people together, all of whom were convinced that it was all going to work and be significant. Before that time, whenever I talked about it, I was always defending it and saying: ‘Yes, in spite of what you say, it’s going to be important!’ At the ICCC there was tremendous enthusiasm. There was enormous intellectual power there; all these people concentrating on doing things. It wasn’t one or two oddballs like myself and Larry Roberts. People were talking about the possibilities. It wasn’t just academic anymore, it was real working stuff. So there was a tremendous difference. I think everybody was very much affected by the success of that as a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clash of the two cultures - circuit switching versus packet switching - had begun. Events still to unfold could never have been predicted, even with the insights gained from those momentous years. For this small, yet growing community of network advocates, change was both certain and welcomed. In fact, the coming out party for ICCC was also a going away party. Crocker now at ARPA would essentially exit the world of communications. Kahn had accepted a position at ARPA and left BBN shortly after ICCC. Metcalfe had already started working for Xerox Corporation’s advanced research center, Xerox PARC, having been recruited by Taylor, who had moved from the University of Utah to PARC. Cerf had accepted a position at Stanford University and his last act at UCLA was participating in ICCC. And while Postel stayed on at UCLA to complete his PhD., he began working with Dave Farber, an important scientist in our coming story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts puts the successful demonstration of Arpanet in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clearly I was influenced by the whole community in that I talked to everybody and tried to collect ideas. I think that one has to look at the follow through; what is it that makes it happen, the whole process? I’ve seen lots of people with ideas, and they mention them and no one picks them up and they don’t carry them forward. You’ve got to then believe and see that it’s economically attractive and viable and have enough confidence in that to carry it through, and that’s really what happened with the Arpanet. I don’t think it was an invention; it wasn’t a theory breakthrough like Einstein. It was a collection of ideas that were around at the time. The computer people had always had blocks and lines were always around; that was nothing new. In fact, I really don’t believe that Paul Baran or Donald Davies influenced the design all that much, because they were hardly involved. Donald did in the sense that he got me to use higher speed lines than I would have used and Paul had done the ‘hot potato’ routing and we looked at that first as a good example and proceeded from there. So, those were pieces that we applied, but the real issue was to carry through and see that it was important and it was economic and it was going to have an influence and make sure it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Even as thirty-five other users at terminals shared the same TIP accessing different computers, or even the same computers - each believing they had sole use of the communication network. Regardless of how mundane an accomplishment this seemed to Roberts, it represented a watershed in computer communications. The revolutionary concept of computers communicating simply by sending packets of data whenever desired over a shared communications network versus having to establish a circuit, send data and terminate the circuit, had been proven. Arpanet, the first packet-switching network, forever changed how computer communications would evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the many computer scientists who had been involved with Arpanet dispersed after the ICCC, they took with them the seminal ideas and optimistic energy of those special days. Soon many were innovating computer communications in ways that could never have been predicted. The story of one such innovation – local area networking – specifically Ethernet – will follow.

By 1974, a sagging economy and merciless competition had firms struggling to break even. Without new applications, such as point-of-sale and credit authorization terminals, sales of modems were projected to be flat.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  No one imagined that in a short few years an announcement of a microprocessor in November 1971 would energize unprecedented opportunities for modems and multiplexers. By the late 1970’s, corporations were installing data communication networks in unimaginable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As advances in semiconductor technology, such as microprocessors, invigorated growth from the ground up, institutional rearrangements sought by the Justice Department promised to open markets once closed. In 1974, an antitrust lawsuit filed against AT&amp;amp;T echoed the same demand as the 1969 antitrust lawsuit against IBM, for their respective breakups. These legalistic grand plays failed to deter those wanting immediate change from challenging the FCC however. The pesky entrepreneurs of data communications saw no reason to be satisfied with the PCA tariffs of 1969 and clamored for attachment rights equal to those of AT&amp;amp;T. The giant firms of data processing railed against the fuzziness of Hybrid Services as defined in Computer Inquiry I and fought to keep AT&amp;amp;T with its immense economic power from entering their competitively decided markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Codex, ADS and the other data communication start-ups, labored to find the right combination of technological investment, product innovation and marketing/sales. To succeed would mean incorporating LSI-semiconductors, microprocessors, innovating network management and, in the case of multiplexers, mastering the discontinuous jump to statistical multiplexing. These product advances would enable corporations to integrate their ad hoc point-to-point networks into on-line networks to support their burgeoning distributed data processing requirements. Not all firms would clear these hurdles. Codex would, but ADS stumbled, reeling from technologies not leading to products and the disappearance of timesharing. Pushed into bankruptcy, ADS would emerge as a new firm, Micom, that after multiple brushes with failure came upon a product idea so simple and timely, management’s biggest concerns became: could they build them fast enough and remain focused? Codex and Milgo, meanwhile, welcomed corporate marriages for very different reasons. By 1979, the surprising opportunities in data communications dispelled fears that markets had topped out, as revenues headed inexorably to the unthinkable $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

And although timesharing suddenly collapsed in 1970-1971, the pick up in sales of mainframe computers from a low of 5,700 units in 1970 to a high of 14,000 units in 1973 meant sales of data communication products continued to grow at rates above 30% per year. The transition to terminal-based, on-line, real-time computing had happened and, combined with the increasing use of remote terminal access, data communications had become a rapidly growing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A next surge in data communication growth would arrive in the mid-1970s, caused not by mainframe computers, but minicomputers. The minicomputer revolution began between 1968-1972 with the formation of ninety-two new competitors. By 1975 sales totaled $1.5 billion. The first minicomputer markets of embedded and engineering applications created little demand for data communications. But by the middle of the 1970’s, minicomputers found a welcomed home in both large and mid-sized corporations performing financial and administrative functions. Driving this trend in large corporations was first the ever-expanding backlog of software development projects of MIS departments that frustrated financial and operational management, and second the need of remote operations for computing to invoice customers or keep track of inventory or generate timely reporting. In 1979, 81,300 minicomputers were sold compared to 7,300 mainframe computers. The demand for data communications products in the form of modems and multiplexers soared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genesis of the minicomputer is the same as that of the modem: the SAGE Project. In 1953, Kenneth Olsen, a recent graduate of MIT and one of 400 engineers hired to staff the SAGE Project, was reassigned to work as a liaison to IBM, the firm contracted to manufacture the SAGE computers. When it was time for a new assignment, Olsen went to work for an advanced engineering group at MIT Lincoln Labs led by Wes Clark. Clark had approval to build the first transistor computer, the TX-2, considered the first personal computer. In early 1957, Olsen left to test his entrepreneurial skills and, together with Harlan Anderson and thanks to venture capital provided by American Research &amp;amp; Development, they founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in August 1957. Their first product, released in 1959, borrowed significantly from the TX-2. In the fall of 1965, DEC introduced the first commercial minicomputer: the PDP-8. In 1967, DEC went public with a valuation of $77 million, 770 times its founding valuation. Every venture capital investor sought the next DEC, thereby contributing to the explosion in the number of minicomputer companies between 1968-1972.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As minicomputers invaded corporate America, a challenging new condition arose. Corporations found themselves with multiple mainframes and minicomputers. And it was a condition becoming increasingly pronounced. The need was obvious: to interconnect all the computers together so that data could be shared and that users would have timely access to all appropriate computers. It was the same need that had motivated IPTO of ARPA to launch the ARPANET. Only this was the world of corporate computing of the mid-1970s. To make sense of this weed-like growth phenomenon, a new vision of corporate computing emerged to replace the IBM mainframe “Host centric” model: distributed data processing (DDP). DDP represented a network of many interconnected computers often with no central host. Only for DDP to work, computers and computer devices had to be networked together, a problem with no comprehensive solution even as late as 1977.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as 1973, data communication companies had introduced modems with diagnostics, a first step in creating networking products. Even these first primitive products necessitated more software and computational capabilities than any products that preceded them. Fortunately, LSI-semiconductor components and microprocessors made the evolution to network-based products possible. Microprocessors, at this stage, were simply components in data communication products. Then the early 1980’s, microprocessors would engine personal computers and fuel an explosion in networking, the second wave in computer communications after data communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the first microprocessor came on November 5, 1971, from Intel Corporation, a venture-capital funded start-up founded in 1968. In announcing the world’s first “micro-programmable computer on a chip,” the 4004 microprocessor, Intel claimed it would usher in “a new era of integrated electronics.” It was advertising hyperbole as master understatement. The 4004 was as small as the first three letters of the word ENIAC, yet equaled in computational power that thirty ton first computer. Even so, Intel management debated whether or not to introduce it. How would the 4004 be used when the total installed base of computers numbered only 88,000? Eight years later, in 1979, an astonishing 75 million microprocessors would be sold&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; – 329,000 as microcomputers&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; – four times the number of minicomputers (81,300) and forty five times the number of mainframe computers (7,300).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Microprocessors would revolutionize computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the microprocessor was not some profound vision or carefully crafted product development strategy. In the summer of 1969, Busicom, a Japanese calculator company, approached Intel needing integrated circuits for its next-generation calculators. Intel’s Marcian E. “Ted” Hoff, Jr. considered their design of twelve chips too complicated and beyond Intel’s manufacturing capabilities.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  Still wanting to find a solution, he reflected on the design of the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer he was using. The PDP-8 had a very limited set of instructions, but because it had lots of memory, complicated control and logic operations were possible. Fortuitously, Intel manufacturing was perfecting a new process to create reliable chips of 2000 transistors, chips complex enough to implement such a design.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  In the late fall, Busicom executives approved Hoff’s design. Only by the time samples of the four chip set were ready, competition had driven end user prices for calculators to unexpectedly low levels, forcing Busicom to renegotiate for lower pricing. In the process, Intel regained rights to sell the 4004 chips for non-calculator applications; a right, however, that meant little if there was no demand.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  Ed Gelbach, the senior vice president for marketing at Intel, argued new applications should be the focus, not sizing the market potential as ten percent of the minicomputer market. Even though stretched for resources, management took the gamble. By February 1972, an encouraging $85,000 of MCS-4 chip sets had been sold.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the next generation 8-bit microprocessor was much the same. In late 1969, Computer Terminals Corporation (CTC), later to be renamed Datapoint Corporation, approached Intel and Texas Instruments (TI) to design and manufacture a LSI chip for a new intelligent CRT terminal.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  But before either company could produce chips, CTC abandoned the product. Intel continued their development program, however, and in April 1972 introduced the first 8-bit microprocessor: the 8008. Next, management explored whether recently advanced memory fabrication technologies might be used manufacture the 8008.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;  It quickly became obvious that to do so required significant layout changes of the 8008. Management decided to re-design the chip and in 1974 introduced the 8080, the first second-generation 8-bit microprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By July 1974 nineteen microprocessors were either available or announced.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;  The other early entrants were large existing corporations: Texas Instruments, Rockwell, Fairchild, National Semiconductor, Signetics, Toshiba, AMI and Teledyne Systems. These firms grew rapidly in 1973-1974 to keep up with demand and then had to adjust to a mini-recession in 1974-1975. Even so, new product introductions continued. By mid-1975, there were forty microprocessors and, by 1976, the number would grow to fifty-four. In 1974, revenues of microprocessors totaled $37.7 million. It was the year the installed base of microprocessors passed both minicomputers and mainframe computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;  In 1975, revenues were projected to reach $450 million by 1980, an annual compounded growth rate of 50%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first real competitor to Intel’s 8-bit processors did not emerge until 1976 and when it did it came from a firm formed by former Intel employees. In July 1974, Ralph Ungermann, manager of microprocessor development systems, and Federico Faggin, a key member of the 4004 team, left Intel and talked of doing something together. Before they could act, Exxon Enterprises persuaded them to start a semiconductor components company to support Exxon’s intended office systems businesses. Ungermann and Faggin founded Zilog Corporation. Soon after, they recruited Masatoshi Shima, the lead designer of the 8080 joined them. The goal of the microprocessor architecture was obvious: a chip both compatible with, and better than, the 8080. In 1976, Zilog announced the Z-80. It was an instant success and threatened the lead established by the 8080.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1976, a surge of next generation 16-bit microprocessors would come to market.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;  Intel, late to market with its 8086, still held the significant advantage of a large installed base of 8080s that could be upgraded easily to the code-compatible 8086. Rumors circulated that Zilog would repeat their 8-bit Z-80 success with a 16-bit microprocessor. Only when they introduced their Z-8000 in early 1979, they made a fatal mistake: the Z-8000 was incompatible with the Z-80. This error nearly killed Zilog and created significant problems for many of the firms using the Z-80 and needing to upgrade to a 16-bit microprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel would win the battle of 16-bit designs. In 1979, Intel introduced the 8088, an 8-bit processor with a 16-bit architecture, and, by doing so, opened up a market that would seem to have no end: personal computers. Personal computers would transform the already emerging Networking wave of computer communications and alter the fates of the data communication firms that had entered Networking with products rooted in their data communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;As late as 1968, the commercial future of information technologies seemed securely controlled by IBM and AT&amp;amp;T. If they had had their way, the opportunities for all independent communication firms would have been severely constrained. The efforts of the Federal Government, by way of the Justice Department, to keep the markets for computers and communications open and competitive, began in 1969 with the filing of an antitrust lawsuit against IBM. While little progress had been made by 1973, a number of corporations had joined in filing antitrust lawsuits and, if nothing else, IBM was on its best behavior - witness its revised software unbundling policy. Would AT&amp;amp;T escape the logic of competition being forced by information technologies? These issues framed the macro-conditions of data communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 1972, John D. deButts succeeded H. I. Romnes as Chairman and CEO of AT&amp;amp;T. Unlike Romnes, deButts had risen through the operating companies and abhorred competition. He wanted to return AT&amp;amp;T to the glory days of Theodore N. Vail when ‘One System, One Policy, Universal Service’ breathed life into work. In September 1973, deButts delivered a rousng speech entitled “An Unusual Obligation” to a meeting of the members of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). In words no one could misunderstand, deButts said his objective was to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;take to the public the case for the common carrier principle and thereby implication to oppose competition, espouse monopoly.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knew his speech would inflame those in government intent on change. He couldn’t have cared less, having an appetite for all the fight anyone might want to begin. DeButts got his wish in March 1974 when MCI filed an antitrust lawsuit charging twenty-two counts of unlawful activity. Then Congress acted. In 1974, Senator Phillip A. Hart, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee, held hearings on his Industrial Reorganization Act that would restructure seven industries - including telecommunications - to make them more competitive,. Appearing before the Subcommittee, Clay T. Whitehead, Director of the Office of Telecommunications Policy,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; testified:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;a restructuring of the communications industry may be necessary if competition and monopoly are to coexist constructively.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Business was falling under public scrutiny. Failures such as the Vietnam War, the threat of President Richard M. Nixon’s impeachment (Watergate), and inescapable inflation all contributed to a social climate where people doubted whether large organizations and institutions could solve much of anything. Within the Federal Government this had the effect of weakening the authority of political appointments and strengthening the power of permanent staff. In the case of the Justice Department, staff that had harbored resentment towards the 1956 AT&amp;amp;T Consent Decree saw an opportunity to seize the initiative and win in the courts what had been lost in private negotiations by political operatives. President Ford fostered such action when on October 20, 1974 he gave a speech calling for tougher antitrust enforcement.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 20, 1974, the Justice Department initiated its fourth major assault on AT&amp;amp;T in filing the antitrust lawsuit: United States v. AT&amp;amp;T Co.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;  More extensive than the 1949 suit, the broad complaint charged that AT&amp;amp;T had monopolized and conspired to monopolize various telecommunication markets: including customer-provided equipment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;  The relief sought was for AT&amp;amp;T to divest itself of Western Electric (WE), for WE to be divided into multiple companies, and for some or all of the Bell Operating Companies to be split from AT&amp;amp;T Long Lines. President deButts wrote shareholders that AT&amp;amp;T was not in violation of the law, that the lawsuit was hostile to the public interest, and AT&amp;amp;T would fight it to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1975, AT&amp;amp;T responded by championing a bill introduced in both houses of Congress amending the Communications Act of 1934. Carrying the formal title of the Consumer Communications Reform Act (CCRA) and known as the “Bell bill,” it aimed to return telecommunications and AT&amp;amp;T to the nostalgic state existing before the Carterfone case. Heavy-handed and showing no room for compromise, the bill nevertheless received respectable support.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antitrust lawsuit progressed slowly, victim of delaying legal maneuverings. In the summer of 1978, poor health forced reassignment of Judge Joseph C. Waddy’s cases. The AT&amp;amp;T case was assigned to a newly appointed District Judge, Harold H. Greene. In September 1978, Greene issued orders for a trial to start in September 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing no signs that it was going to be denied control of data communications, AT&amp;amp;T announced its Advanced Communications Service (ACS), an intelligent data network intended to be as easy to use as telephones.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;  ACS would obviate the need for modems or for any user to have to be concerned with interconnecting incompatible computer devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1979, Charles L. Brown succeeded deButts as Chairman and CEO of AT&amp;amp;T. Having experienced enough combativeness, Brown announced a new management philosophy acknowledging and accepting competition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am a competitor and I look forward with anticipation and confidence to the excitement of the marketplace.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As slowly as the AT&amp;amp;T lawsuit had been progressing, the one filed against IBM seemed motionless in 1979; notwithstanding the fact numerous corporations had joined the fray: Telex, Greyhound Leasing, Hudson General, Transamerica, Memorex, and Forro Precision.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;  Only the Telex case had been decided: in favor of IBM, but only after a Appeals Court over-ruling. An Appeals Court also overruled in the Greyhound Leasing case, but this time against dismissal, hence against IBM. Who could guess the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of year end 1979, the Justice Department still had pending uncertain and controversial antitrust cases against the two dominant companies in technology and the two companies viewed as most important to the future of computer communications: AT&amp;amp;T and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In early 1973, Carr found himself in unfamiliar territory. Codex was profitable, demand for its modems never stronger, and the 1972 year-end public offering had provided sorely needed cash. Existing contracts and changes in lease accounting virtually guaranteed near-term revenue growth. Thus freed from the stresses of having to manage every day as if it might be their last, Carr turned his attention to the threat of LSI semiconductor technology and decided it was time to contact Rockwell, a firm he knew was interested in modems from their having tried to sell Codex the failing ADS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploratory telephone conversations confirmed Rockwell’s interest and motivations. They wanted to fabricate a 9600 bps modem chip to sell to Japanese facsimile manufacturers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;  Rockwell also made it clear they had no intention of selling stand-alone modems. The opportunity seemed too good to be true, so Carr, Storey and Forney arranged to visit Rockwell. In a pre-meeting strategy session over breakfast at the Anaheim, California Disneyland Hotel, Forney told Carr and Storey his Rockwell contact made clear that they had no interest in a relationship with Codex unless Codex committed to buy a minimum of 5,000 chips. How easily hope turned to despair. The idea seemed so preposterous that they could hardly maintain eye contact: 5,000 chips meant 5,000 modems when only eighteen months earlier they all remembered laughing so hard they cried when Pugh projected selling 400 9600 bps modems. Fear, however, makes the impossible seem doable, especially for someone like Carr who had endured too much to fail now. Carr could not dismiss the rumors that Milgo, and others, had LSI modems under development. So rather than write the trip off as a valiant effort, Carr proposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look, if we go in and we tell this guy that we’ll commit to 10,000 and he buys the deal, we’ll get started.” So we went in and we had the meeting and we committed to 10,000 modems, and he took it with a pretty straight face, and I gave it to him with a straight face, and we cut a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of negotiating a contract, including the thorny issue of circumventing antitrust regulations, the difficult and time-consuming work of designing and fabricating the chip began.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;  Carr could now do little but wait to see if he had averted disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr’s immersion in the world of semiconductors gave him valuable insight into the rapidly advancing state of semiconductor technology and the availability of commercial chips. Discussing this knowledge with Pugh in one of their frequent end-of-the-day conversations when as friends they quit being boss and subordinate and sat with their feet perched on whoever’s desk, to speculate as to what their competition was up to or what the latest customer trends were or what they should be doing to survive and prosper in a fast moving industry in which no one had claim to a crystal ball. As usual, they wondered if it was time to start development of a computer front-end communication processor Their 3C experiences – when they sold minicomputers as communication front-ends for mainframe computers – informed their instincts. Might substituting microprocessors for minicomputers yield a new product line, a line that might sustain Codex if modems in fact proved doomed? Developing computer technology competencies would also force Codex to overcome a deficiency that concerned both men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as if a prayer had been answered, James Vander Mey, a professor at the University of Illinois, asked Jim Rothrock at a Codex trade show booth if they had any interest in front-end communications products. Rothrock forwarded the inquiry to Forney who, after confirming the legitimacy of the source, discussed the issue with Carr. Soon Carr and Forney were making trips to Illinois to sell Vander Mey on joining Codex. Vander Mey wanted to be acquired, but after the Holsinger experience, Carr strongly preferred hiring people and avoiding the baggage of an existing organization. Carr’s persuasiveness won the day, and in May 1973, Vander Mey and a handful of his best students became Codex employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1973, the state-of-the-art of front-end communication processors, while generally understood, remained in implementation proprietary to each manufacturer. This posed a challenge for Forney since Vander Mey reported to him. How could Forney master these new technologies that were deep in content and superficial in exposition? Reviewing the available technical literature pointed him to recognized experts such as Wesley W. Chu, Professor of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;  Chu pioneered work in a new technique of communication line-sharing known as statistical multiplexing (SM), or asynchronous time-division multiplexing. While his work held only tangential importance to front-end processors, it directly affected Codex’s TDM’s which were based on more dated techniques of synchronous time-division multiplexing. Forney discovered more relevant literature, but as events would unfold, Chu’s work would have the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Forney investigated the technology, Pugh began assembling a marketing team by raiding Memorex, the only company offering a competitive product to IBM’s best selling 2703 front-end processor. Soon marketing was specifying product requirements for engineering and writing a business plan to drive strategy and operations. Not long into the process, however, Pugh concluded he and Carr had significantly underestimated the commitment required to compete against IBM. For one thing, Codex had no experience creating and supporting host computer software. A cautious Pugh recommended all development be stopped and, before the end of the year, Carr concurred. By then, however, Vander Mey and his team had so impressed Forney, Pugh and Carr that they wanted to find another project for them to work on. They choice was a statistical multiplexer.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Statistical multiplexing is the third important innovation in the technology trajectory of multiplexing after frequency-division and time-division multiplexing. Chu’s theoretical work in statistical multiplexing began in 1966 after he earned his PhD. in electrical engineering from Stanford University and joined a new computer communications studies group at Bell Labs (AT&amp;amp;T). Created in response to complaints concerning interconnecting terminals and computers over telephone lines, the study group began investigating terminal to computer communications. From traffic measurements, the group learned terminals typically used about 5% of the bandwidth of communication lines, leaving 95% of the bandwidth unused. The question was: How to multiplex the traffic of many terminals over a communication line to most efficiently use the bandwidth of the circuit and thereby reduce communication costs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chu’s first thoughts turned to improving time-division multiplexing (TDM). In TDM, each terminal connected to the multiplexer has full use of the communication line on a rotating basis for a dedicated, fixed period of time. While a significant improvement over frequency-division multiplexing, TDM still suffered inefficiencies because terminals in rotation frequently had nothing to transmit. How then to give terminals with data to send control of the communication line? (See Exhibit 6.1 Statistical Multiplexer.) A solution required intelligence – the multiplexer had to determine which terminals had data to send and how to queue the terminals so as to optimally serve all terminals – and storage buffers, and both microprocessors and memory were expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-741-statistical-multiplexer&quot;&gt;Exhibit 7.4.1 Statistical Multiplexer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-6.1-STDM-vs-TDM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison of statistical multiplexer and time division multiplexer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Chu left Bell Labs to teach at UCLA. While he continued to investigate statistical multiplexing, the prohibitive cost of hardware precluded any immediate practical application. Then in 1971, Intel introduced the 4004 microprocessor. Only it lacked the computational power to perform the logical operations required of statistical multiplexing. When Intel introduced the 8008 in 1972, Chu converted his design to the new eight-bit microprocessor and began experiments using sixty-four terminals as input. Again he found, one chip did not provide the needed computational power, so he redesigned his system using two 8008’s and by 1975 had a working statistical multiplexer supporting sixty-four terminals. Chu filed successful patent applications in 1976 and 1977 covering his statistical multiplexing innovations. As it turns out, neither he nor UCLA ever asserted their rights.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/7.5/Codex-The-LSI-Modem-and-Competition-1974-1975/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By year end 1974, Carr and Pugh’s decision to invest in LSI semiconductor technology took on new meaning. First, AT&amp;amp;T finally introduced a 9600 bps modem: the 209A that leased for $230 per month. Two other competitors also began selling 9600 bps modems: Paradyne (M-96: $6,500) and ESE Ltd., a Canadian Corporation (96/QMP: $7,000). The even more crowded 4800 bps modem market numbered at least a dozen competitors included 1974’s new entrants, IBM and Intertel. No longer did Codex and Milgo exclusively control the rarefied realm of high-speed modems. Also of concern was IBM’s announcement of its Systems Network Architecture (SNA) providing a single standard access method and link control for terminals connected to IBM host computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;  While not an immediate threat, it implied computer firms eyeing control of data communications in competition against AT&amp;amp;T. The future looked bleak for independent modem manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bleak or not as the future picture was, Forney had committed to have the LSI modem ready for introduction by the fall, which was when management expected the Milgo announcement. As a reminder that they were not alone in anticipating the importance of LSI technology, in April 1975, Paradyne announced an “all-digital 9600-BPS “stripped” modem being manufactured on special order for Datran,” for its digital data network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;  It would be sold OEM for prices as low as $2,000. Forney lost little sleep over this announcement for he knew his modem was anything but stripped down. His technical team had conspired with their counterparts at Rockwell to significantly upgrade the C series design, not simply converting the C design to LSI as had been negotiated by the “business people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the fall 1975 Interface trade show, Codex, with fanfare befitting their accomplishment, introduced their L series modems. They caught the world by surprise: here was a 9600 bps modem (LSI 9600) the size of a shoebox and for only $8,500.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; Carr remembers with excitement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We expected we were in a death race with Milgo.  In fact, we went to the show sure we would see theirs, and we were going saying:  “Whew, at least we’re going to be in the same show,” and they didn’t have anything, and they didn’t have anything for over a year after that, and we just – I mean, it just wiped them out. We heard, later, from people that worked at Milgo, that the day we introduced it, they had a 12 or 13 hour meeting, and concluded that we had put them out of business. it was such a major shock to them. It was an enormous cost – it was probably the biggest single thing Codex ever did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear that Milgo would beat them to market blinded Carr and management to the impact announcing the L series would have on their existing sales of C series modems. Carr recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem we had was we introduced the L-series in the fall of ‘75, which was during the ‘74 -‘75 downturn, and we weren’t in product. We had made some, but we weren’t really in production, and all the C-Series business dried up, because everybody wanted the L’s, so we had, in the fourth quarter of ‘75, a really – that’s the closest Codex came to losing money from the time we turned it around in ‘72.  It was a very hard lesson…. But we just didn’t think we dared wait. Then we found out, much to our chagrin, we were a year early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the QAM technology that Codex had brought to market would become the CCITT international 9600 bps private line standard. While this made the QAM technology public and thus invited competition, it also confirmed Codex’s technical leadership and was a coup over AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1973, ADS, once the rising star of data communications, closed its doors. Neither Norred nor any Rockwell executive willing to risk his reputation on the now soiled investment could induce even a hint of interest in it either as a business or as a distressed sale of assets. In March 1973, Rockwell management, tired of explaining to themselves why they tolerated a business without any prospects of generating income sufficient to cover even the interest on Rockwell’s debt, skipped filing the customary Chapter 11 bankruptcy and discharged ADS into a let’s-get-it-over Chapter 10 bankruptcy.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;  Rockwell flew an executive to London to inform their UK distributor, Case LTD, their one important customer, of their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Evans, the Case executive responsible for data communications, and thus the Rockwell relationship, first reacted with dismay. For any day, Evans had been expecting to hear Case and ADS had won a multi-million dollar order for ADS 670 multiplexers from the British Post Office (BPO, to become British Telecom).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;  Evans quickly reasoned, however, that if Case bought the rights and assets to the multiplexers from Rockwell, then Case eliminated BPO’s sole objection: the multiplexers were not sourced or manufactured in the UK. It would also initiate Case’s metamorphosis from distributor to manufacturer, an evolution always contemplated yet never thought possible. Evans had to see Norred; for any plan to be work, he and Case needed Norred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred too considered picking up the pieces of ADS and plowing ahead. With bankruptcy wiping out the debt, and thus the ongoing interest expenses, there just might be enough revenue to generate a small profit. The critical assumption hinged on Case, for without their business, the numbers simply did not compute. There his thoughts generally ended. The conservative engineer in him called an end to such daydreaming and reminded him he needed a job. He figured that he better call Carr at Codex, who he knew from trying to sell ADS, and who had left him feeling that he would hire him if given the chance. Then came Evan’s call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans and Norred cut to the chase. Evans wanted Norred’s help and proposed Norred assist Evans and Case’s lawyers specify the assets and intellectual property needed to satisfy the on-going needs of Case and the hoped for contract from BPO. Case would assume all the costs and legal responsibilities of working with the bankruptcy court and, if successful, Case would then contract with a company Norred would form. Only as the weeks passed, it appeared their efforts had been in vain. Norred recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Almost as a final ditch effort, we made a proposal to the receiver to buy half of the inventory and to acquire a non-exclusive manufacturer’s license for the product line, and he accepted it.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On hearing the good news, Norred and Evans met in Evans’ hotel in Woodland Hills to celebrate and decide upon their next actions. Evans wanted to return to England as soon as possible with a contract executed with Norred’s new company to show BPO and secure the contract. Evans pressured Norred to name his company so a letterhead could be created on which to document their relationship. Exasperated, Norred said, “why don’t I just call it my company?”which he then shorten to Micom. Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was just a business opportunity, with no real business plan whatsoever. I owned 100% of the company and put a little cash into it, I think  $20,000, just so it would have a little equity on the balance sheet, and the company literally was a company in support of Case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next two and one-half years, Norred and his small company of never more than a dozen employees survived by manufacturing and servicing formerly ADS products for Case while they:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;dabbled and diddled around with some microcomputer-based products as well as other communications interface products that we tried to sell, not terribly successfully, frankly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred knew he needed to create new products. Depending almost entirely on Case for his marketing and sales, he naturally tried to incrementally innovate products Case had already sourced from other manufacturers in hopes of replacing them. Rarely did he meet with success. Desperate to find products to create and sell, Norred turned his attention to products interconnecting the multiplexers he already sold. Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The minicomputer manufacturers were all very poor at data communications products. So I decide there was a market opportunity. We had all these remote multiplexers and we could do all this very powerful networking with a very simple interface. The only flaw was – we tried to sell it to Data General and to everybody – was lack of software support; we never really were very strong in software. We recognized it, but never made any attempt to resolve it, and as a result, we never went anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late 1974, Norred even thought hard about leaving data communications and doing something he would enjoy more: “I never did like the data communications business.” But as he tried other ideas on, he kept returning to what he had been doing for the last six years and decided that the opportunities in data communications simply too “interesting.” Resolved to grow Micom, he again tried to raise venture capital. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1974, ‘75 was, I believe, the all time low ebb for venture capital. Frankly, I don’t recall having maybe more than one meeting with anybody that had any interest in investing in Micom. I couldn’t get any attention from anybody. We didn’t represent in our business plan anything particularly unique or new, we looked like a ‘me too.’ By my nature, I suspect, the numbers that we presented were conservative – we tended to meet our numbers – and most venture capitalists, in my mind, always take them, divide by three or something, and so we were unsuccessful. The decision I took was to go after what I call the custom phase of our business. The strategy was to find people who would be willing to pay us for the development of a data communications product that they couldn’t buy on the open market, but needed badly enough that they were willing to pay somebody else to design it and manufacture it for them. The first one of those was a company called Datran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred knew marketing and selling were not his strengths. Yet neither could he find someone to hire; everyone he talked to sounded all too willing to spend money he did not have. So while he sought new customers to fund new products, his most reliable source of revenue and new product ideas remained Case. Evans remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was concerned that we were becoming unacceptably dependent on the R&amp;amp;D coming from Micom, and Bill was having a hard time putting a real company together. He never really found a marketing guy before that he felt he could work with the way he felt he could work with me. So we put together a deal whereby Case was going to invest in Micom – a minority position. It was a complex deal where other European investors were going to get involved too. I was going to come over here as the guardian of that investment, but also to add the marketing ingredient to Micom and, perhaps, sell some of the Case products we developed in the UK over here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans joined Micom in May 1976, shortly before the scheduled closing of the Case-led investment. Norred tells what happened next:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can recall very clearly looking out the window one day and seeing Derek Levell, who was the joint managing director of Case, coming up the parking lot to Micom, and I wasn’t expecting Derek. He was there to give me the good news that they had run into some financial difficulties that they hadn’t anticipated. And they would not be making the investment in Micom, and that, because of their financial difficulties, they were going to be curtailing or eliminating a substantial number of the development contracts that we had with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a founder of Case, Evans could have returned to England, but “decided to cut the cord and stay here anyway.” He focused on Datran, which quickly became Micom’s leading customer, while trying to find other customers. Then came another blast of unwelcomed news: On August 26, Datran, owing Micom $110,000, 80% of their accounts receivable, filed for bankruptcy. Evans recalls the shock: “The day they filed, we decided we had two weeks in order to raise some money or we were out of business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred and Evans scrambled to find capital investors to save their company. They contacted a number of venture capitalists before abandoning the idea. Then they focused on finding a corporate investor, hopefully to make a minority investment but, failing that, to acquire their small ten-person firm. They contacted Vadic, a supplier of modems to many of the same manufacturing representative firms they used. Vadic would hire them but had no interest in buying their company. They contacted Case, but generated no interest. They thought of calling Carr at Codex.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;  Then a business broker introduced them to John M. Thornton, the chairman of the board of Wavetek, a company on a recent spree of acquisitions. Thornton proposed the investment to his board, which turned him down. Unwilling to let what he regarded as a potentially good investment get away, he asked for, and received, permission to make a personal investment in Micom. In September 1976, acting as agent for a group of investors including David M. Goodman and Martin B. Ortlieb, Thornton advanced a loan of $35,000, invested $2,160, and made a line of credit of up to $200,000 available in return for 51% of Micom.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;  Norred and Evans had once again eluded disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that if they did not settle on a successful strategy soon they would be living a repeat of the past month, they strained to craft a scenario both realistic and likely to succeed. The recent flurry of statistical multiplexer announcements by Codex, Infotron, DCA International, and Timeplex dated their TDMs. To innovate a statistical multiplexer, however, meant becoming a systems supplier with large sales and service organizations, a strategy they thought beyond their means and interest. But to bank their future on continuing to do more of the same seemed sure to invite failure. They considered selling inexpensive data communication products by catalog, but decided to stay the course for a few months longer while Norred continued working on other potential products. If nothing came of their efforts, they would get into the catalog business.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The evolution of data communications never strayed far from the co-evolving redefinition of AT&amp;amp;T and the limits of market competition. With its 1974 antitrust lawsuit, the Justice Department had launched a frontal assault intent on dismantling AT&amp;amp;T. The FCC functioned by exerting pressure to change the rules governing the attachment of customer equipment to the AT&amp;amp;T network, and the rules governing the boundary between communications and computing and which businesses would be regulated and which would be shaped by market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernard Strassburg, Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau of the FCC, knew the fight over foreign attachments was far from over with AT&amp;amp;T’s filing of the PCA tariffs on January 1, 1969. Given that the FCC only had regulatory authority over interstate telecommunications, and intrastate telecommunications in those states that did not have their own Public Utilities Commission (PUC), it was virtually certain some states that had PUCs would contest the right of customers to attach devices of their own choosing. The reason was no big mystery. If customers purchased their own attachments, modems or PBXs for example, or connected to an alternative carrier, such as MCI, then telephone companies lost revenue and local telephone rates would surely have to go up since local telephone rates were subsidized by the profits AT&amp;amp;T made on customer premises equipment and interstate telephone calls. Known as the “separations problem,” it was a necessary consequence of a monopoly and an artificial accounting that inflated costs and invited market competition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to preempt state actions, Strassburg announced a Joint Proceeding with NARUC (National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners) on June 14, 1972. Strassburg made clear that the objective was not to review Carterfone. That had already been decided: tariffs now allowed connection of customer-provided CPE with the use of PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;  The issue was whether, and under what conditions, customers would be permitted to provide their own PCAs. Strassburg recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Joint Proceeding would consider the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences, the Advisory Committees, the Chief Engineers Office, and any other comments. That was to be the forum for formally resolving the PCA issues and registration – or any other alternatives to PCAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NARUC and the individual states were not content to leave all to the Joint Proceeding however. NARUC and seventeen state PUCs conducted their own investigations of the damage that could result from the interconnection of customer-owned and maintained terminal equipment. To get data required requesting it from AT&amp;amp;T, who wanted to support NARUC’s concerns and, ideally, reverse the Carterfone decision. In April 1973, they publicized their results. After studying 1,523 cases of CPE problems, they concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it is clear that the interconnection of subscriber-provided equipment has had adverse effects to date on the quality of telephone service.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NARUC deferred in drawing conclusions however. Five weeks later, the FCC reported that in reviewing the data: “statistically meaningful differences” between customer-provided and telephone-company provided equipment could not be demonstrated.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next North Carolina directly challenged the authority of the FCC to proscribe intrastate telecommunications policies and tariffs (Telerent Leasing). Then the PUC of Nebraska declared any PBX connected to intrastate lines a common carrier, needing to get a certificate of convenience and necessity, which, was obvious to all, would take a long time. Where North Carolina took the battle to the courts, Nebraska waged war administratively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, AT&amp;amp;T continued to implement their PCA program, and, increasingly, defend their policy from charges of monopoly and conspiracy to monopolize. By 1974, there would be nearly one hundred different kinds of PCAs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;  As of January 1972, over 10,000  DAAs, the PCAs used with modems, were in use - half manual and half automated, the later introduced in mid-1970. (By July 1978, 160,000 PCAs would be in use.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;  Competitors soon began selling PCAs and claimed their PCAs cheaper and better, proving again AT&amp;amp;T’s conspiracy to monopolize. (Two examples were the STC voice connecting arrangement, originally developed by AT&amp;amp;T – ironically enough – and the Rochester program.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;  There were also claims that AT&amp;amp;T should implement a registration program, like the one being discussed by the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 1974, Walter R. Hinchman became the new Chief of CCB on Stassburg’s retirement. In March 1974, only months after retiring, Strassburg gave a speech to a meeting of the North American Telephone Association (NATA), the group independent manufacturers of CPE organized by “Tom Carter” of Carterfone. Strassburg advised them that they “must look elsewhere than to regulation for a solution.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;  Given the knowledge and insight of someone so respected, it is small wonder private antitrust suits began being filed in record numbers. (See Exhibit 6.1 Number of Active Antitrust Cases Pending Against AT&amp;amp;T.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1974, the FCC acted to protect its Federal jurisdiction by issuing a declaratory ruling in the Telerent Leasing Proceeding asserting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;primacy in authority over the terms and conditions governing the interconnection of customer-provided equipment to the nationwide telephone network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;State PUCs were put on notice not to take actions reversing or inconsistent with prior Federal rulings related to the interconnection of customer-owned CPE and systems to the “indivisible” telephone network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;  The North Carolina PUC immediately appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit– North Carolina Utilities Comm’n v. FCC, 537 F.2d 787 (4th Cir.) NARUC and other states soon joined in the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the court took time to render a decision in the jurisdictional dispute, the Joint Proceeding took testimony.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1975, the FCC issued its first decision from the Joint Proceedings. Direct connection of customer-provided CPE would be allowed, subject to either FCC registration or self-certification. If CPE met rigorous technical criteria – the Commissions registration program comprised 112 pages of procedures and technical specifications – no PCA had to be used. PCAs were still required for CPE that had not been registered. The same parties that had appealed the Telerent Leasing decision now appealed the FCC’s registration program. In November 1975, the FCC ruled that manufacturers could provide DAA-equivalent circuitry effective June 1976. AT&amp;amp;T appealed and, in response, the FCC postponed the effective date to June 1, 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1976, the Fourth Circuit Court ruled in the Telerent Leasing case in favor of the FCC. The FCC could preempt state jurisdiction to impose nationwide telephone standards. Before the end of the year, the Supreme Court refused an appeal for review without further comment. In March 1977, the Fourth Circuit Court ruled that the FCC’s equipment registration/certification was legal. Six months later the Supreme Court again denied a writ of certiorari, a request for review. The power of the FCC had been asserted and registration could replace the use of PCAs. Furthermore, AT&amp;amp;T now had to certify its products as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another open issue between the FCC and AT&amp;amp;T was that of Hybrid Services from Computer Inquiry I. Hybrid Services were defined as those that had both data processing and message-switching components. This definition had become critical for AT&amp;amp;T clearly wanted to enter data processing markets and chafed under the proposed separate affiliates solution. On August 9, 1976, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemaking. It became known as Computer Inquiry II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, in May 1979, the FCC released its Tentative Decision for Computer Inquiry II. To better define Hybrid Services, a distinction was made between voice and basic non-voice. Voice services remained regulated, and basic non-voice services (read data processing), unregulated. “Dominant” carriers could offer basic non-voice services, but only through separate subsidiaries, subsidiaries that would not be regulated. AT&amp;amp;T objected to separate subsidiaries, arguing the advantages of economic synergies would be lost. The Justice Department objected to the very concept of the FCC trying to expand its authority under the Communication Act to include structural issues, arguing the Act gave them no such authority. The FCC took these and other comments under advisement.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In early 1974, after Carr had authorized the development of a statistical multiplexer, Vander Mey recommended a multi-microprocessor architecture. While probably biased, as his intellectual interest was multi-microprocessor architectures, the recommendation fit well with Codex’s engineering culture, a culture that prized the technically challenging. Only Vander Mey changed his mind as to which microprocessors to use. This led to delays and mounting stress.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc50&quot; href=&quot;#fn50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one who felt the most stress was Forney. With more talent than he ever imagined he would have working for him, Forney began questioning his management abilities. Carr, however, would have nothing of Forney’s self-doubts. Forney didn’t want confidence boosts, but help in bringing an end to an “extremely painful development.” By the fall of 1975, he concluded outside review might bring fresh perspective and insight no longer possible on the part of his exhausted and over-worked staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing Wesley Chu was co-chairing the Fourth Data Communications Symposium being held in Quebec City, Canada, that October, Forney attended hoping to talk to Chu about consulting. On learning Chu’s multiplexer was much more modest than Vander Mey’s ambitious design, he reluctantly concluded they were way beyond the point where high-level consulting might help. Vander Mey’s team did lack practical engineering skills, however, like knowing how to release a product to manufacturing, or knowing how to eliminate noise from their design. So Forney hired expert consultants when possible, still hope for success fundamentally rested with Vander Mey and his team. They forecast a spring 1976 manufacturing release.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a spring release, marketing kicked off the launch of the statistical multiplexer in early 1976. Management’s first goal was to stimulate customer interest in their innovative -and expensive - new product. A second goal was to train the sales force how to sell a product requiring customization, a far more complicated sale than selling modems off a price sheet. Codex began making customer presentations, leaving customers product data sheets and other information for review. By February, TDM competitors had copies of Codex’s literature, and while the expected price of $25,000 to $50,000 meant they posed no immediate threat to the much cheaper TDM’s, many competitors recognized that they too had to offer statistical multiplexers if they were to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-1976, Codex was no nearer to shipping product than when they began marketing their statistical multiplexer earlier that year. Frustrated, Carr sought an outside opinion he could trust and hired Lowell Benski, a former engineering manager he had worked with at 3C and who was now a consultant, to conduct a program review. Carr remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He came in and his final report was: It will take another year before you introduce this thing. I told him while he sat there: ‘It’s going next month,’ and he looked at me and said: ‘You are either incredibly ignorant or you have the biggest balls I have ever encountered.’ And I said: ‘If we work at a lab pace, it’ll be another year, or maybe longer. Does it work? You tell me, yea or nay, does it work?’ ‘Yes, it works, but it doesn’t have this and that and this part of it is shaky,’ and I said: ‘Then we go, and we will work night and day in some customer facility, if that’s what it takes. And that’s what we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1976, Codex introduced the first two models of their 6000 Series statistical multiplexers: the 6030 and 6040. The Model 6030 supported 124 terminals and cost up to $30,000. The Model 6040, to ship May 1977, supported 248 terminals and cost up to $60,000. As Forney opines: “It was a fantastic tour de force in computer architecture; but in retrospect, we undoubtedly aimed too high.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr may have hoped his biggest problem was behind him when he forced the Model 6030 out-the-doors. As things turned out he but it had been swapped it for a new, no less challenging, problem. Carr explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We changed two out of three regional managers that one year, small measures like that. The problem that we had anyway was this cultural thing about it isn’t a modem and those are computer things. Secondly, the very pragmatic thing is that they could sell modems like falling off a log, and the SM [statistical multiplexer] needed support help and you had to work with the customer and you had to configure systems and you had to bid it and the whole nine yards, and it was just too damned hard. We tried contest incentives and I got to what I called the disincentive mode. They wanted to know what that was, and I told them that for everything below quota they were on the SM, they lost commission on the modems.  And I said:  “Anybody don’t want to do that,” and these guys said:  “Me,” and “Me,” and I said:  “Good-bye, and good-bye.”  We had quite a year, a big, big field turn over year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year-end competition emerged, in part because Codex had given their competition warning in their early marketing to customers. Codex would prove up to the challenge. In mastering statistical multiplexing, Codex had established a second strong product line to its new LSI modems and had anticipated the emergence of a new driving force in data communications: networks.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970’s, the modem and multiplexer markets were revitalized, not stalling at some maximum size as forecast by Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan in 1972. LSI semiconductors and microprocessors made possible new product innovations that in turn enabled customers to construct data communications networks. The evolution from point-to-point data communications to far-flung multi-point, distributed data processing networks, with management and diagnostics, fitted perfectly with the needs of customers installing more and more computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1977, the headline in one of the largest information technology weeklies read: “Data Com, Distributed EDP Push Modems Toward $200 M Year.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;  Sales of modems for 1976 were reported as $184 million, far surpassing the $67 million forecast in 1972. Sales of high-speed modems alone reached  $91.7 million. Little wonder Milgo and Codex were so successful. The article notes growth for the coming year would come from networking/distributed processing. (For an analysis of the competitive mix see Exhibit 5.2 Datapro Multiplexer and Modem Surveys 1976 and 1980.) Each of the leading firms in data communication responded differently to these market dynamics. Cumulatively the firm decisions and actions constructed a social network, or population, known as Data Communications. Within Data Communications were more tightly connected networks such as modems or multiplexers, and even within these networks there were sub-populations or sectors such as high-speed modems versus dial-up modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;intertel&quot;&gt;Intertel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1973, Jerry Holsinger started asking how Intertel, the company he founded in 1970, was going to be successful against competitors such as Codex, his former employer, or even against Milgo. Doubting he could continue to grow the company on OEM sales as originally envisioned, he began asking some large end-users if they had problems that were not being solved. From discussions with companies such as Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and Eastern Airlines, one rather significant problem emerged. Holsinger remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the old days of point-to-point, there were skilled people at both ends of the line. If you have a problem, you call the guy up at the other end and he gets out his patch panels and his test equipment and you work on it. In a multi-point network, you have operators at the remote end on terminals. They don’t know nothing from nothing. So you were now operating in an environment where the only technically skilled people were at the computer site, and in the meantime, these were on-line networks where, if it was down, it wasn’t like: ‘Oh well, what the hell, we don’t run our batch today, we’ll run it tomorrow.’ It was like: ‘Hey, they’re not working.’The bank wasn’t doing transactions or the airline wasn’t making reservations, and that’s really how it was. People were starting to understand they’ve got problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with Gunther Kempun, their contact at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, Intertel engineers designed a diagnostic card that would go into their modems; modems that would also have dial back-up capability to restore malfunctioning lines. Holsinger recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I recall, we sold off xeroxed spec sheets to good old Gunther Kempun, because he was a real pioneer. You know, all this leading edge stuff you sell to pioneers, the guys that want to do the leading edge kind of thing, and they get excited because they are influencing your product, so if you get the right guy, then it is a dynamic interaction. and then he’s really hooked.  So in 1973, we sold our first stuff to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first selling network control products proved very difficult. In 1974 network product sales could not offset the loss of a couple of big OEM’s, and sales remained flat with 1973 at $3.4 million. In 1975, network products began having market traction and 1976 and1977 were great years, with sales approaching $20 million. Intertel had established itself as leader in the shift to networking modems. In 1978, they ran an ad that came out just before the TCA trade show challenging customers to ask their Codex, or Milgo or Paradyne salesmen if they could match the features of Intertel modems. Matt Kinney of Milgo remembers thanking Holsinger:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we got to this show, I made a bee line to go and thank him for legitimizing my company in the network management business, because the leader of the network management business said that we were in it. I chased down Art Carr and the two of us went off and we had a beer together and roared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, however, Holsinger had decided he had had enough. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I said, after a lot of soul searching: “I want to go out and get a president, a guy that’s a good marketer, experienced manager and all that good stuff, and let me go back and dream up new things.” And we went through a search; spent about 18 months looking for a guy, brought in a fellow by the name of Sy Rosen, IBM background in marketing, Harvard MBA. On paper, he had run a division of General Instruments, he even had a physics undergraduate degree, which I found to be valuable to make people feel comfortable in the technical world. English majors don’t feel real comfortable with technical people.  So this guy on paper was perfect, smooth, polished, the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosen took over in May 1978 and within nine months Holsinger, still Chairman and CEO, knew he had made a mistake. Holsinger remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was clear that either he went or the company was going under. So I did my thing and he left and I stepped back in. It was painful because I didn’t really want to go back in at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-datacomm&quot;&gt;General DataComm&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1973, General DataComm began exploring if they could OEM a 201 modem from Intertel. Bob Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For various and sundry reasons the deal didn’t work out. However, they were aware of and had access to our diagnostic card. At the ICA show in New Orleans in 1974, you look at the front panel of their diagnostic card, it looked that same as the diagnostic card we had here. So Intertel’s out there in the marketplace selling diagnostic systems, and the first one that they sold successfully was Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. We bid that job against them and lost by a big number of dollars and I was later told that they bought that job because they wanted the contract. The history is that Intertel became very successful on Wall Street. They owned the Wall Street community in terms of data communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of diagnostics from their earliest days, management invested in new products. Yet as is common, engineers move from company to company, often taking ideas with them, or companies incrementally innovate on the success of others. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around 1976, there was a guy working here who left and went to Paradyne. He took all of these diagnostic ideas to Paradyne.  One trade show, they show up and they’ve got a little tape playing in the back of the booth with all these crazy displays that come up on the screen, and that was the beginning of their Analysis system. Now, some time later, I interviewed a guy who was working at Bell Laboratories. The story as he tells it is: ‘We look out in the world and we see this company, Intertel, selling all these diagnostic systems, and we did a study. We decided that the market really could use a good diagnostic networking modem.’ So they proceeded to develop Dataphone II.  It is my conviction that the Paradyne Analysis, AT&amp;amp;T’s Dataphone II, the Intertel DMS and then the competitors like Milgo and Codex, seeing this coming along, all started here at General DataComm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;paradyne&quot;&gt;Paradyne&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1972, Paradyne management began a process that would transform their company from one struggling to grow sales beyond a few million dollars into one of the world’s leading modem suppliers. They won a contract from Datran to jointly develop a 9600 bps LSI modem – months before Codex started working with Rockwell.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;  By the end of 1973, management recognized the need to find a seasoned President. In hiring Robert Wiggins in April 1974, they made a brilliant decision. Wiggins would lead Paradyne for over a decade. With thirteen years of marketing and product development experience with IBM, having worked for a timesharing company, and most recently having headed the Information Systems division of GTE, a division attempting to agglomerate a series of data communication companies and a minicomputer company into a presumed working whole, Wiggins fully understood the importance of a 9600 bps LSI modem. In 1975, Paradyne began shipping modems to Datran and, in early 1976, won a follow-on contract worth $5,2 million. To take advantage of the emerging opportunities, Wiggins hired a seasoned Vice President of Corporate Marketing, Jay Hill, who shared his views as to how to build a successful company. In early August 1976, Hill, who was “captivated” by Wiggins and had been with IBM before building a successful career in sales and marketing at Inforex, a very successful data processing firm, came aboard full of a newcomer’s enthusiasm. Within days he received a rude awakening. Hill remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t quite understand the significance of the problem when they were running around the halls saying:  ‘Oh my God, Datran just filed for bankruptcy. How much inventory do we have?  How much do they owe us?  It’s been locked up by sheriffs,’ and things like this, but that wasn’t the important part.  It was whether we could survive the loss of the top line and the attached profit that went with it. Bob just succinctly came into my office and said:  ‘We’ve had a very unfortunate thing happen to us. Our largest customer is gone and you have to make up for it. Get going.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill buried himself in work, recalling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I saw all my direct reports I was frightened to death. As a matter of fact I told my wife: ‘Don’t unpack. This may not work.  These bozos are from a different world, and I’m scared to death.’ I called on a friend of mine who worked with me at both IBM and Inforex and was just a really solid, good guy. His name is Jerry Kendall, and I said:  ‘Jerry, I need one guy I can trust. I’ve been here 30 days, and nobody speaks my language, and I need one person to tell me what the customer is saying so that I can understand it. I’ll treat you well. Please consider coming over.’ It took me a month to get him.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ever-composed Wiggins never lost his confidence. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had an LSI technology where we could build a 9600 bit per second modem, I believe, less expensively than anyone else, and we were very aggressive in pricing those products, because technology permitted it, and we needed to gain market share, because we had to have business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two years, Hill began building an “IBM-like” salesforce largely on the back of a rapidly growing market for high-speed point-to-point modems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt; Then in late 1977, engineering delivered a new product that allowed Paradyne to sell networks of modems with network management and diagnostics. The Analysis Network Management System catapulted Paradyne into the role of supplier to then emerging need of large corporations to tie together their far-flung computers and peripherals into on-line networks. Hill remembers Analysis as being “the breakthrough and one of the things in Paradyne’s history that really gave it a big lift.” Hill elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After 1978, we would sell one Analysis to a major insurance company like Hancock, and 100, 200, 300 modems would go out, and at that time, pricing of modems played a very key role in Paradyne’s success. The list price on a 4800 modem back then was $3,000, and we would sell them in any reasonable quantity, at $2,400 per copy and an aggressive bid, back then, and this is ‘78, ‘79, we would just get below $2,000, and our gross margins never on a sale like that, got down to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success in modems did not translate to mastering statistical multiplexing however. Wiggins recalls the relationship with Case, the firm Evans of Micom once worked for and whose multiplexer technology had begun with ADS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What we had tried to do, realizing that it was going to be difficult to fund development programs in every area of technology, we set about trying to forge a working relationship.  Case had a good multiplexer technology. They were not selling in the US, and we were furnishing them our modems, so we said what we’ll do is forge an agreement in principal that will be a working relationship so that we’ll keep you competitive in the high-speed modem marketplace, and you keep us competitive in the statistical multiplexing marketplace. That went along well for a while, and we were moving multiplexers pretty well, and then Case decided to come into the US marketplace, and they bought the old Rixon company,  and became competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1978, Paradyne became a public company; selling stock for $10.00 per share, raising approximately $5.9 million and having a market valuation of $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;milgo&quot;&gt;Milgo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1970’s, Milgo remained market leader in modems due to early entrant advantages and not making mistakes. But there was more, as Kinney explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would attribute some of Codex’s growth, and frankly ours too, to the fact that the market was so damn big, and there was so much potential that there was no way that one single organization could grow fast enough to accommodate the entire thing. You could not move fast enough to dominate it. There were literally a few years when Codex’s sales group and our sales group never saw one another at all. They were exploiting one set of opportunities. We were exploiting another set of opportunities. They were strained to the maximum to be able to grow at the rate they were growing, as were we. I don’t think competition as such became a real factor in this industry until the mid ’70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then came Paradyne and market competition. Kinney remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Paradyne considered itself a latecomer into the marketplace and did what most latecomers do, and started slashing, cutting, burning the prices. So that opened up the users’ awareness that they can get equivalent products for a lot less money So they started playing us one against the other as you would expect, and competition became a real factor in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milgo was not averse to pressing its own advantages, whether real or perceived. As early as July 1971 Milgo had attempted to forestall competition by filing a patent lawsuit against Rixon Electronics, et al., claiming three of its patents had been infringed upon, including those on its 2400 bps and 4800 bps modem. Proving others could play the same game, in December 1974, Western Electric, a division of AT&amp;amp;T, sued Milgo, claiming ten modem patent infringements.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt; After conferring with the Justice Department, that the prior month had filed an antitrust suit against AT&amp;amp;T, Milgo, in February 1975, counter sued Western Electric charging violation of the 1956 Consent Decree involving patent royalties on the manufacture of modems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex unintentionally added to the confusion after receiving their QAM signal structure patent in 1975.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc59&quot; href=&quot;#fn59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt; Forney remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The most dangerous time in a company’s existence is when it gets issued, a patent. It looks at this thing and says: “This must be worth something,” and you’re very tempted to go out and assert the damn thing. So we got this patent. Milgo clearly had been using the technology. They weren’t the only ones, but what we finally wound up doing, not really knowing what we should do, we wrote Milgo a letter and said:  ‘We have this issued patent, and it seems you’ve been using it, and we ought to have some discussions about it.’ Well, what we were told later by people at Milgo is that they got this letter and what made a profound impression on them was that it came by certified mail, and so they took a paranoid view of this letter, that it was a prelude to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of slow motion, legal confrontations shifted into high gear. In January 1976, the court awarded Milgo a victory in its patent suit against Rixon et al.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc60&quot; href=&quot;#fn60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt; Not leaving others long to wonder what they would do, ten days later in February 1976, Milgo sued AT&amp;amp;T, asking for injunctions stopping Western Electric from manufacturing and AT&amp;amp;T from distributing its 4800 bps and 9600 bps modems. Milgo also sued Yellow Freight Systems of Kansas, a user of Codex 9600 bps modems, claiming they had violated its patents. Thirdly, Milgo sued Codex seeking “declaratory relief” since Codex patents violated Milgo’s patents.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc61&quot; href=&quot;#fn61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt; Codex responded almost immediately by filing lawsuits against Milgo in Miami and Boston in March. In reflecting on Milgo’s behavior Forney offers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it was very much an afterthought that they swept us into this litigation.  Their concern was almost entirely for AT&amp;amp;T, but secondarily, they had a problem with Codex’s patent on the signal structure. So, it is interesting how these things start. In retrospect, it was a great mistake for Milgo to sue us. They had lots of hooks in AT&amp;amp;T and they hassled them to death. We were, it turned out, a much more formidable foe for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that same March, the Federal Court sided with Milgo and ordered Western Electric to defend itself against Milgo’s claims of violations under the 1956 Consent Decree before it would hear Western Electric’s suit against Milgo.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc62&quot; href=&quot;#fn62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt; In April, Milgo asked the Federal Court for $44 million in damages it claimed “to have suffered as a result of alleged antitrust violations and unfair competition by Western Electric, AT&amp;amp;T, and the Bell System in the licensing of modem patents and the sale and rental of modems.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc63&quot; href=&quot;#fn63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as if Milgo did not have enough legal concerns, on November 8, 1976, Applied Digital Data Systems (ADDS), a computer terminal manufacturer with sales of $17.8 million, announced a take-over attempt of Milgo, offering a swap of stock valued at roughly $50 million – a $15 million premium over Milgo’s public valuation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc64&quot; href=&quot;#fn64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt; The much larger Milgo, seen as struggling after a 56% drop in earnings for fiscal year 1975, albeit sales still totaled $40.4 million, rejected the offer two days later claiming it was “not in the interests of the shareholders and does not reflect the long-term prospects of the company.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc65&quot; href=&quot;#fn65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt; After weeks of jockeying, on December 1, Milgo, in a maneuver to stave off ADDS, announced its intentions to sell 312,000 shares of stock to its UK partner, Racal Electronics. ADDS immediately filed a restraining order to block the sale that the court issued on December 9. Jockeying continued and by February 7, 1977, Racal and ADDS each claimed 45% ownership of Milgo’s stock. By the 18th, Racal appeared to control over 50% of Milgo’s stock, and on the 23rd, ADDS tendered its stock to Racal, ending the hostile action, and giving Racal subsequent ownership of Milgo for $62 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc66&quot; href=&quot;#fn66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt; (Milgo’s other legal battles ended with an out-of-court settlement with AT&amp;amp;T and, in June 1981. they lost their lawsuits with Codex.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplexer firms faced different challenges as they responded to customer needs for networking, competition and their own organizational dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeplex&quot;&gt;Timeplex&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1973, Timeplex became one the last technology companies to go public. Even so, the cash raised did not ensure Timeplex’s success. Botwinick remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company essentially was insolvent at the end of fiscal year June of ‘76. What had happened was that the auditors had come in and finally figured out that the assets were significantly over-valued. All of the profits were sitting in overstated assets, and there was no management. It was a simple as that. Anyway, they struggled through 1976 with Allen &amp;amp; Co. pounding on Chemical Bank to keep the doors open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to keep the bank happy, an effort was made to sell the company. Codex came to look the company over, as did Milgo. Neither saw enough value to make a bid. However,  neither Timeplex’s poor financial performance nor lack of interest on the part of potential buyers prevented a power struggle for corporate control from developing between the investment bankers, Allen &amp;amp; Co., company management and eventually a group led by Botwinick. By the spring of 1977, Botwinick had exhausted his financial resources in buying enough shares of Timeplex’ public stock to end the stand-off. On June 27, 1977, he became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Botwinick remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second week I was here, I went out to lunch with the guys from Chemical and United Jersey banks, and at the end of the lunch they said to me: “This is all very interesting. You’re the first guy we’ve ever talked to in this company that seemed to know what he’s talking about, but we’ve had it. You have 60 days to tell us how we’re going to get our money back or else.” I don’t know what the ‘or else ‘ would have been, because there was nothing there if they wanted to shut it down. So I didn’t take that terribly seriously. On the other hand, I was in imminent danger of going broke personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botwinick immediately began aggressively collecting over due receivables to raise desperately needed cash. In doing so, he learned the company had shipped defective product in order to record sales, defective product that would need to be replaced. He then began selling whatever assets had any value. Combined, Botwinick recovered enough cash to pay the banks and create some breathing room. He then took a hard look at the recently introduced Dynaplexer, a statistical multiplexer hub that worked with its TDMs but had no terminal or computer ports. While offering their large installed base the option of upgrading to the latest multiplexer technology, Botwinick remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got a close look at the DynaPlexer and I realized that it was conceptually flawed. First of all, they had no capabilities to develop it. It was too complex. They had no software skills. They didn’t understand microprocessor software development – it was an old icon of a hardware company. Second was that the concept was flawed, because the old TDMs that were in the remote sites were all hard wired. There was no way to remote configure them. It wasn’t going to sell. Also, they were never going to get it to work. We pushed the delivery schedule out considerably. We said we were redesigning the product, putting in all kinds of hot new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing the Dynaplexer was not salable, and might never be, Botwinick turned his attention to developing a microprocessor-based stand-alone statistical multiplexer. Investing long hours with a focus only desperation can inspire, Botwinick and his new engineers innovated their Series I Microplexers that was introduced in 1978. Then in one of those strokes of good fortune, Western Union, literally up the road, decided to end their efforts to develop a statistical multiplexer to compete with Codex. Botwinick leaped on the opportunity and hired a trained team that immediately started developing a product to replace the feature-weak Series I Microplexer. The Series II Microplexer was introduced in 1979. Botwinick remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Series I came to market and it held the doors open. In fact, it stimulated sales of our old TDMs, which were still the bulk of our business. At that point, we did get some people from Western Union because they had gone out of the StatMux business. They came in and did the Series II. Now, the Series II was the first networking unit that we did, and that’s what we built the company on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;infotron&quot;&gt;Infotron&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When James Hahn, founder and President of Infotron, saw Codex’s Series 600 statistical multiplexer literature in early 1976, he instantly knew they needed to develop one as well. To do so meant hiring an engineering manager with microprocessor experience, because no one on staff knew the least bit about these miniature computers. In discussing where he might find someone with his wife, Leigh, who still worked for Ultronic Systems, the company Hahn had left to found Infotron, she recommended they interview Bill Dambrackas, a young engineer who had just developed a specialized terminal to display stock quotes for brokerage firms using Motorola 6800 microprocessors. Hahn’s overture couldn’t have been better timed. GTE, under the leadership of Wiggins, was consolidating Ultronic Systems and a number of other companies to form an Information Systems division to be homed in the facilities of the minicomputer company they had bought in California. Dambrackas did not want to relocate. The idea of working just a few blocks down the street, with the challenge of managing a high profile statistical mulitplexer project, made for an easy decision. Dambrackas joined Infotron in March charged with having product to ship by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dambrackas knew he did not have the luxury of generating an entirely new design and that he had to use as much existing TDM circuitry and packaging as possible. If their existing TDM’s were field upgradable into statistical multiplexers, Infotron might just pull the carpet out from under Codex’s grand design. The marching orders: keep it simple and get it done on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dambrackas strengthened the Infotron team with some hires from Ultronic Systems and set to work. In October they announced the Supermux 780, for a base price of roughly $6,000, subject to having Infotron’s TDMs. Arguably no where near the product of Codex’s 6030, it nevertheless gave an interested buyer a much cheaper alternative with which to test this new technology. Dambrackas remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While Codex did a revolutionary design, where they had a whole fresh start on the whole box, they had a lot of headaches and a lot of start-up problems. So even though they announced the product, we ended up bringing our product to market and beating Codex pretty good. And it was a big hit for Infotron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicative of the impact, over the next three years, over 3,000 Supermuxes were sold compared to 950 Codex’s 6030s and 6040s.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc67&quot; href=&quot;#fn67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt; In dollar terms, however, Codex’s sales exceeded Infotron’s. Dambrackas comments on what happened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Codex quickly made a 6010 which moved down into the lower price range. It was cheaper and simpler. But they started off, I guess, saying that statistical multiplexers would be sold like a very special thing, and they didn’t realize it would drop down into the dirt so quick and end up being the bricks and mortar of getting data around. You know, it’s funny how these things start off to be very exquisite, special things, and then they drop down to being something that people throw around like modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Dambrackas’s leadership Infotron would introduce a range of statistical multiplexers over the next few years. Then in early 1979, headhunters called on him with another opportunity. In June 1979, Dambrackas would leave Infotron to head Milgo’s efforts to develop their own statistical multiplexer as Director of Data Network Products.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;After the last minute financing in September 1976, Evans knew he needed to find a viable product opportunity if Micom was to escape its uninspiring past. To find a compelling product idea he began making calls with his manufacturing representatives. In one such call, he learned that Gibraltar Savings and Loan in Los Angeles had a Data General minicomputer and wanted to support offices in San Francisco and Fresno by generating mortgage and trust deeds on-line. The manufacturing rep had sold the account on using Micom’s TDMs, claiming they would support three terminals and a printer in each office when used with 9600 bps modems. Evans would inform the customer that using TDMs would not work. He tells what then happened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I ended up walking away, first of all having made a friend for life because the customer had actually for the first time talked to a salesman who had sold him off something, rather than onto something. Secondly, I walked away saying:  ‘If we could solve this, we’d have a real business here.’ Third, I had at least learned enough from this guy to know that there were quite a number of other guys in the area planning to do similar things. So I was shocked in a way that I perhaps wouldn’t have been if I had grown up with it – the fact that these minicomputers were being used for business applications all over the place. They were growing like wildfire, and people were actually – in some cases had actually put multiplexers in to do some of this stuff, and there were several things that were obvious. One, they desperately needed retransmission on error, just to make the thing usable at all. Secondly, they were paying an arm and a leg for 9600 bit per second modems to be cut up into four 2400 bit channels where the terminals were hunt and peck in one direction and only sporadically used in the other direction. So the data traffic was minimal, and it was the classic case where a statistical multiplexer comes into its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a flash of insight, Evans envisioned selling statistical multiplexers to minicomputer users. His instincts were so strong and certain, he assumed others had seen the opportunity as well, and if they hadn’t, it wouldn’t be long before they did. A sheer volume of what he didn’t know, what he had to know, and how much there was to do before he could be clear as to what Micom should be doing and when, preoccupied his thoughts and emotions. As for details, such as having to find a customer who would fund the development and not retain product rights (for Micom had no cash to develop and launch a statistical multiplexer) well, they were just details, and would be sorted out in due time. To be so certain yet faced with so many uncertainties might have stopped a less street-wise, self-confident entrepreneur, but Evans knew he had a winner and he was not going to let it get away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans first sought to confirm that the Gibraltar situation was not unique, that the growth in use of minicomputers to support remote locations was substantial and unaddressed by other multiplexer vendors. To his amazement, the potential appeared larger than he would have ever imagined. He also learned system integrators sold and installed most minicomputers and they required a margin of 40% off list price – a discount structure he assumed Micom would have to offer as well. Furthermore, the telephone circuits between terminals and computer tended to be much shorter with minicomputers than mainframe computers. Shorter telephone circuits meant less expensive lines and reduced savings to justify purchase of a statistical multiplexer. Evans recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I talked to potential customers, I ended up concluding that the real market probably lay with a list price around a couple of thousand dollars for a four channel box. We also realized that, whereas Codex and Milgo expected to install their equipment with an engineer that understood communications, we were going to be reliant on systems integrators or the end customer himself, neither of whom knew anything about communications.  So ease of use and built in test facilities were absolutely key, and do it yourself installation was much more important than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next came the challenge of finding a customer to fund development. In a stroke of good fortune, an existing customer, Reynolds &amp;amp; Reynolds (RR) of Dayton, Ohio, sought a device that would connect terminals in their customer locations, automobile dealerships, to their minicomputers. They had a potential supplier of a “very dumb” product that might work, and queried Micom to see whether they could offer a better product at the same low price. If Norred and Evans had any questions as to the viability of the market they were contemplating, they were dispelled when they asked RR how many boxes they were interested in buying. Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They said:  ‘Well, certainly we’re going to need at least 1,000.’ To us, a 1,000 of anything was just mind boggling. You just didn’t sell 1,000 of anything in our business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred began evaluating design options not knowing how to solve a problem known as “flow control.” When too many terminals wanted to send data at the same time, a solution was needed to store the “overflow” data, presumably expensive memory chips. To Norred’s surprise, minicomputers had a “stop terminal” command that stopped terminals from sending more data. It was then that Norred began to believe a low cost statistical multiplexer, or “concentrator” as Micom would name it, was possible.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc68&quot; href=&quot;#fn68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt; Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was that breakthrough, in my mind, that was the biggest, most significant element of why we could build a concentrator and make it a viable product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred’s first design for RR proved way too expensive. In reviewing how much cost had to be eliminated to meet the objectives of both RR and Evan’s preliminary concentrator specification, both men doubted it could be done. Fortunately, Norred had designed in a microprocessor, the Zilog Z-80, which allowed them to substitute software for logic chips, and as Evans summarizes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We threw out a chip here and a chip there, and then ended up concluding we still hadn’t thrown away too many chips to be able to implement statmux code and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late summer of 1977, Norred and Evans knew that their concentrator would be ready to ship in early 1978. To their surprise, no competitor had announced a similar product, or one targeted to the rapidly growing minicomputer market. Evans remembers his wishful thinking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If, when we’re ready to launch the statmux it looks like we really have the field clear, we’ll stop everything, focus on the statmux, and become a one product company for as long as it takes for us to dominate and have resources to spare, because the rest of the world’s being stupid enough not to see the opportunity now, but they sure won’t be once we bring the product to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1978, Micom introduced the revolutionarily modest Micro800 Data Concentrator, Models 804/814 and 808/818, priced from $1,650 to $2,750. They were instant hits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc69&quot; href=&quot;#fn69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In mid-1976, amidst the continuing challenges of ramping production of the L-series modems, finishing the statistical multiplexer and wondering if business conditions would ever improve, Carr had a visit from Keith Bane, director of corporate development of Motorola, proposing Motorola acquire Codex. Carr recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bane gave me this pitch why we ought to be bought by Motorola, and I basically threw him out. Their plan was that they were going to buy five or six companies for $100 million and be in the data com business, and they had to do that because they had no in-house expertise. I told him he couldn’t find five or six good companies, and if he did, he couldn’t manage them, and he couldn’t do it for $100 million anyway. Therefore he didn’t know what he was talking about, and we had, in our long range plan: ‘we will not be acquired by anybody.’ And I showed him the door. On the way out he said:  ‘If I come up with a good plan, can I come back,’ and I said:  ‘Yeah.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chilly reception Carr gave Bane masked his own gnawing concerns of how best to navigate Codex through an increasingly complex environment. Gone it would seem were the days of almost gentlemanly competition among a handful of well-known-to-each-other firms. Now each week brought new surprises, and fateful signs that the lumbering AT&amp;amp;T and the voracious computer companies saw data communications as another means to achieve market domination. Was there a future for independent data communication companies, or were they destined to be swallowed up by the larger, more diversified firms? Carr decided to engage his senior managers in serious reconsideration of assumptions long held inviolable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dispassionate evaluation of modems came first. Fortunately, they had seen the implications of semiconductor technologies for modems and acted. To believe the press, every high-speed modem competitor had LSI modems under development, if not already announced.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc70&quot; href=&quot;#fn70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; The first to announce an LSI modem, Paradyne, had set the tone of coming competitive dynamics with aggressive pricing. (Although the August bankruptcy announcement of Datran might be the undoing of Paradyne and permit a return to more traditional market behavior, or so Codex management hoped.) Semiconductor microprocessors introduced another uncertainty. For example, Milgo had recently introduced Fairchild microprocessor-based modems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc71&quot; href=&quot;#fn71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt; Would the reprogramability of microprocessors prove more important than the speed and costs of LSI custom designed circuits? Another new development, initiated by the Codex-spinout Intertel, emphasized the integration of network control and diagnostics into modems. Then there was the advent of multipoint modems, modems that allowed multiple modems to share the same telephone circuit, thus dramatically cutting communication costs. How would Codex fare in the face of such divergent modem developments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As confused as the future of modems appeared, it seemed comparatively certain against the nightmare of deciding what products to offer after multiplexers. Multiplexers were an obvious choice as they made modems much more cost effective. Many thought computer terminals logical products to sell as almost every data communication application involved connecting remote terminals to host computers. However terminals, historically decidedly low-tech, were becoming intelligent which probably meant rapid product development cyles compared to modems and multiplexers, competition was fierce – every major computer company, including AT&amp;amp;T, sold terminals as did countless independent firms – and servicing mechanical products in the field was a real headache. If not terminals, then what products could be sold to the computer-end of circuits? Yet just as Codex had deferred innovating a front-end processor because of the hurdle of developing and maintaining host computer software, any host-end product ideas always seemed to involve a massive software effort, a competence Codex did not have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More threateningly, the computer companies now sold data communications products and were introducing sophisticated networking software products. IBM had started the trend in 1974 with SNA. In 1976, they significantly enhanced SNA, to include support for multiple computers. In reaction, every major computer company announced similar products, including the minicomputer manufacturer DEC with DECNET in 1976. If the challenge of developing host computer software had seemed daunting before, it had now become a seemingly impossible undertaking. The question facing the data communication companies had suddenly switched from one of: How to achieve growth by interfacing products to computers? to one of: How not to be locked-out by the computer companies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any contemplation of the future had to include the nemesis of all data communication companies: AT&amp;amp;T. The DAA (Data Access Arrangement) was going to become a relic of the past, although not until June 1977. Not to be counted out, however, Pacific Bell had publicized the idea of “connecting blocks,” another way AT&amp;amp;T could charge for interfacing foreign attachments to their network – the idea would die a deservedly quick death. But more shenanigans could not be dismissed. In addition, AT&amp;amp;T had the technological and financial muscle to wipe out the independent manufacturers if it ever set its mind to doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of markets and the volatile state of data communications, on November 8, 1976, Applied Digital Data Systems (ADDS) announced a take-over attempt of Milgo. Could Milgo escape the embrace of the unwanted suitor? Carr and Codex management had to wonder if they were to endure the same fate only with Motorola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Bane returned as promised and presented a new plan of acquisition. Carr considered the new plan only marginally better than Motorola’s prior plan and bluntly said so. Bane would not be denied, however, and persuaded a curious Carr to meet Robert Galvin, Motorola’s CEO. Carr, having reviewed Codex’s options with management, and stunned by the victimization of Milgo, realized he felt far more disposed to the idea of being acquired than he had assumed. He had to chuckle thinking of the trials of the past year: they were enough to cause anyone to question why they would want to be President of a young technology company. Carr recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, here came Motorola and said:  “If you’re buried in Motorola, you’re not going to be visible. You don’t have to perform every quarter. We can fund you. Our interest is in making you the foundation of a new business which we’re willing to fund. Your interest is in dominating your marketplace. With us, you can do more than one thing at once. We started thinking about how much capital we could raise, and we thought we could raise a lot of capital, but we didn’t see how we could manage the P&amp;amp;L.  We used to have an analyst meeting every quarter, and we had analysts who stood up and were unsatisfied with 36% pre-tax. They’d say: ‘You’ve been doing 36% for six quarters now. When are you going to improve it?’ You wanted to climb up on the guys chest and take a hold of his tie. We were literally in the mode where we were almost doing nothing wrong and they were on us about things we were doing right and why weren’t they better. And the board, believe it or not, was giving us the same routine. ‘Why don’t you crank up earnings per share?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the insiders, Storey, Forney and I, finally concluded that A, we had had enough of the board; B, that we could probably fund both the front-end and the terminal launch inside of Motorola; C, they were our kind of people. We spent a lot of time on that, in terms of ethics and the way they went about things, culture. Lastly, we would not only be autonomous, but we would be the core. I had told Galvin all the horror stories of Computer Control being acquired by Honeywell at the time it was just passing DEC, and dissolving it over the course of the next three years. So he told me that if we did this thing, that I would be in charge of managing the acquisition, not somebody at Motorola, because they didn’t know anything about it. So we finally decided that, from a strategy point of view, we believed we could advance the fortunes of Codex more significantly being buried in Motorola and drawing on their resources than we could by being a free-standing company and having to dance the quarter-by-quarter tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 7,1977, Motorola announced an agreement in principle to acquire Codex in an exchange of stock valued at more than $80 million. On February 23rd, Racal acquired Milgo. The two leading independent data communication firms, and long-time foes, now had to learn if being small entities in much larger corporations gave them the resources and freedom to extend market leadership. Or would they become data communications-also-rans in a market that had suddenly become much more challenging?&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of the Micro800 Data Concentrator announcement in January 1978, Ed Botwinick, President of the struggling Timeplex, called saying he was in the neighborhood and wanted to visit. Evans remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ed Botwinick came by to say he had heard about our product and it certainly sounded very interesting. Of course, it was very unfortunate that we had no sales and marketing capability, and, therefore, we were really going to have a hard time doing justice to this product – but he had the perfect solution. We said that we did have a pretty clear understanding of how we were going to take this product to market. In considerable irritation, he then moved into threat mode – that if we wanted to have Timeplex compete directly with us, then I’m afraid that was the way it was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botwinick remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to buy them. They had announced their product and we had not yet announced our Series I.  I told them about it and I figured it might shake them a little bit, but they decided to go their own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred and Evans had expected competition. What the competitors did not anticipate, however, was that the combination of having no money, no installed base of customers or committed channels of distribution, and a high degree of confidence in knowing who would be buying their product caused Micom to introduce something far more than simply a very clever product. They innovated an entirely new way of marketing and selling data communication products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prior fall, when Norred and Evans made the data concentrator the focus of Micom, they agreed their ship-and-use statistical multiplexer would be sold to minicomputer users through broad-based distribution. A $2,000 list price provided for both a 40% discount to the channels of distribution and a healthy gross margin for Micom. Evans remembers the problem of creating credibility given their product strategy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Timeplex had been in the business for years and was nowhere close to shipping a product it had been claiming it was going to deliver for two years. This is a grave – GDC had done exactly the same. Codex was the only guy out there, and they were losing money because it had proven to be a much taller order than they realized. And we were going to come out with a product at TDM prices and we ran the risk of having people laugh at us, just kill themselves laughing, that some start-up comes out with a product that offers all this capability for no money – you’ve got to be crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome market disbelief, Evans invested his entire year’s budget in a product brochure: “so quality and Fortune 500 in its feel, that nobody could even question that this company was for real.” A photograph of an orange juice can next to an orange was the cover shot:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the orange being the old fashioned way to start your day, and the concentrate can being the new, efficient way to get your orange juice in the morning. Hence the analogy: the old fashioned way of transmitting data being the orange and the new fangled way, or the efficient new way, being the concentrate in the can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a ton of money, but it had to be, so Evans spent the money on the brochure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And within six months, almost everywhere I went, people would say: ‘Oh, you’re the guy from the orange juice company.’ The oranges made an incredible impact because, for a company in our kind of business, it was unheard of to do that kind of thing. So it became a fundamental part of Micom and what we stood for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-7120-micom-micro800-ad-in-computerworld-nov-12-1979&quot;&gt;Exhibit 7.12.0 Micom Micro800 ad in &lt;em&gt;Computerworld&lt;/em&gt; Nov 12, 1979&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/micom-orange-juice-ad-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Micron Micro800 ad 1979&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micom also held product seminars for buyers, not “techies.” It proved a winner, broadcasting Micom’s success as if inviting competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infotron responded first, just as they had to Codex. In early 1978, an Infotron customer, Bank of America, showed Dambrackas, director of multiplexer engineering, a Micom Data Concentrator. On seeing the “little plastic box you could put in an attaché case,” he thought it “cute” but wondered: “Why such a small number of channels?” Not posing any competitive threat to Infotron’s products, he quickly forgot about it. But not for long, for it soon seemed as though every conversation ended up involving Micom and their strange little plastic box. Dambrackas bought a couple. In playing with them, he soon “got very excited,” and saw ways to make improvements – largely from using the recently introduced Motorola 6502 microprocessor. In December 1978, Infotron introduced their Supermux 480: four channels for $1,725 and eight channels, $2,725. They didn’t, however, change their distribution or marketing practices, simply listing the Supermux 480s in their standard product catalog; revealing they saw only the technology and not the important new market of results-oriented minicomputer users opening up – users who did not buy data communication products in the then traditional manner.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;   Infotron would not be alone in making this mistake. By mid-1980, six other firms would announce low priced statistical multiplexers – none would impact Micom’s market dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micom’s sales nearly doubled to $1.5 million in 1978 and then grew an astonishing 250% in 1979 to $5.3 million. By 1980, Micom’s sales of $15 million equaled those of the two leading multiplexer companies: Timeplex and Infotron. Norred recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The growth of the Data Concentrator was so far beyond our expectations. We ran for almost three years trying to figure out ways to get manufacturing big enough to deal with the orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred and Evans made yet another critical, and prescient, decision in mid-1978 when they decided to OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) the Data Concentrator to other data communication firms. Evans remembers their strategy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;to get our volume up so fast that we would get down the cost curve just on a volume basis to where we’d be untouchable because we exploited the lead in the market. We also were convinced that we were clearly going after a target market that had never heard anything about Codex or GDC or Paradyne, and that those guys could take product from us and it would be totally incremental to what we’d be sending through our channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex introduced products OEM’d from Micom in July 1979; as did GDC later that year. Paradyne would follow in 1980. (In 1980, one-third of Micom’s sales would be OEM.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc73&quot; href=&quot;#fn73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1979, Micom’s strategic focus on dominating low-cost statistical multiplexers appeared to be working like a charm. They held an amazing 80% market share. However, some critics questioned whether Micom was missing out on the emerging demand for networking systems. Evans’ characteristic response to Micom’s critics was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We may be unique in the business today with no systems orientation. Some say it’s our fatal flaw but I prefer to think we know something they don’t.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc74&quot; href=&quot;#fn74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast to past experience, Micom’s meteoric success had venture capitalists pounding on their door, begging the company to take their money. However, Micom didn’t need money; tight fisted expense management, exceptional profitability – in 1979 pre-tax profits were 27% of sales – and the ability to dictate terms of sale to its channels of distribution, all helped minimize cash requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hovering around the company as well were other companies with designs on acquiring Micom. Dave Goodman, one of the outside directors of the Board, sensed that Norred and Evans might be tempted to sell the company prematurely, or would become gun-shy of growing the company aggressively for fear of risking their existing paper capital gains. He proposed they sell some of their stock to eager-to-invest venture capitalists. Goodman also argued that if Micom ever sold stock to the public, they would benefit from the advice and cachet of venture capital investors. Norred remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The driving force, as much as anything, wasn’t to bring money into the company. It was so Roger and I could both sell some stock and put a little away before we screwed the company up. There was also an element of listening to people – it would be important to us to get other people involved that could help us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1979, Micom sold 796,000 shares for $3.021 per share; the company raised just shy of $1.6 million and the selling shareholders received nearly $800,000. Micom’s new market value: $16.6 million. Three years earlier the company had been valued at less than $500,000. On paper, Norred and Evans were multi-millionaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financing changed the conservative management style of Norred and Evans in two important ways. First, in allowing each to take some of their money off the table, they no longer lived under the threat of losing everything if Micom’s fortunes declined; in fact, the moneys already received were close to their original hopes/expectations. As a consequence, they became motivated to make their remaining shares worth as much as possible, including growing Micom large enough to go public – a goal reinforced by the new venture capital shareholders. A second effect of the financing was to further reduce the risks of either the company running out of cash or being unable to finance accelerated growth. They could also afford the expenses of additional management, management needed to free Norred and Evans to concentrate on strategy and growth. One of the first acts was to initiate a search for a Vice President of Engineering so Norred could focus on being President.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Sure it would help if the two wounded, but far from dangerous, behemoths would slug it out with each other and ignore the profitable patches of product opportunities in data communications thought too small or fast moving to be of interest. But the fact was, the leading data communication firms had, or would soon have, enough financial muscle of their own to survive and prosper. They had anticipated the future and it was now theirs to reel in. (See Appendix 6.1.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the firms of data communication were speeding the efficient transfer of bits of data at ever declining prices, another whole community of innovators was transforming the ARPANET into a functioning network and beginning to explore how to both improve and diffuse this new technology of communicating packets not bits. The exposition of packet technology would take paths of originality that by 1979 would set off a new explosion of entrepreneurship that would run directly into the future being carved out by the firms in data communications.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The successful demonstration of Arpanet at the International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC) in October 1972 proved a turning point in the history of computer communications. There did remain much to do before Arpanet functioned as envisioned by its creators, work that would continue under the auspices of the IPTO. But a working network also presented a conundrum: neither IPTO nor DARPA had charter authority to operate a network. It had to be transferred to a private organization. AT&amp;amp;T exhibited no interest and the other most likely organization, BBN, seemed equally disinterested. That was until some of its key employees resigned to start just such a company. With its hand forced, BBN hired Larry Roberts to commercialize the Arpanet technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A working Arpanet also encouraged the IPTO to build a packet radio network. To lead the project, they recruited Robert Kahn from BBN. He immediately tackled both the network software problems of Arpanet and the issue of how to interconnect Arpanet to a packet radio network. Working with Vinton Cerf, they designed an entirely new network software protocol: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Europeans, not to be left behind, launched a number of networking projects about the time of the ICCC. In addition to creating networks very different than Arpanet, including pure datagram networks, the Europeans led the creation of an International Networking Group that then became International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group (WG) 6.1. For those debating the nature of computer communications, IFIP WG 6.1 became a maelstrom. The gulf between data and voice communications seemed unbridgeable. The computer researchers sought harbor in standards making bodies and instigating new networking protocols known as Open System Interconnection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the proliferation of computers in the United States stimulated creation of many new networks. David Farber led the innovation of a token ring network interconnecting many computers and peripherals using twisted pair wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Xerox PARC, Robert Metcalfe creatively adopted many of the ideas of the Arpanet and the ALOHAnet to create another type of local area network. Ethernet let computers broadcast their packets whenever they wanted as in ALOHAnet - no passing of permission tokens like token ring. Etherent worked magnificently and entailed the design of yet another networking protocol: PARC Universal Packet (Pup). Pup would in turn be redesigned into Xerox Network System (XNS) to accommodate an even faster Etherent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 1970’s, the work initiated with the packet radio network project, clarified in the IFIP WG 6.1 meetings, and intensified with the innovation of local area networking led not to a unified approach for computer communications but to three computer networking protocols and many networks.

Roberts approached AT&amp;amp;T and BBN. AT&amp;amp;T rebuffed his inquiry and BBN displayed little interest.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Believing he had time to solve this problem, Roberts buried himself and his small staff in the many other IPTO projects such as artificial intelligence, speech understanding, various computer projects including Illiac IV, and other communication projects like ALOHAnet. Why? When viewed through a budgetary lens, Arpanet barely made the list of ARPA’s important projects. After four years an estimated $3.5 million had been spent buying IMPs from BBN to construct the Subnet.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; (Total investment including the costs of attaching Host computers to the Subnet and IPTO management is an estimated $10 million.) &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; During those same four years, ARPA’s total spending was $833 million; making Arpanet one half of one percent (.5%) to one and one half percent (1.5%) of ARPA’s budget; in other words barely significant.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Arpanet could be divested, however, it required continual expansion and improvement. By June 1974, the number of Arpanet nodes totaled 46.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The following table summarizes the growth in nodes by user type. (See Exhibit 6.0 Arpanet Nodes by Type By Date.) Government agencies - primarily the military – made up most of the growth between 1972 and 1974. With military usage came all the rhetoric of national security that further complicated divesting Arpanet to the private domain.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts had been around technology development long enough to know that operating and improving a system that in the end would have to be divested was a headache avoid. So in late 1971 he pressed BBN to step up to the plate to solve his and ARPA’s dilemma. However, BBN saw itself as a government contractor, possibly the seller of product into commercial markets, but never as an operator of a communications network. The mere thought of dealing with the FCC, beginning with the effort to attain approval to operate a network without the burden of regulation, was a daunting barrier to entry. Yet in order to be seen as responsive to Roberts, BBN management created a committee to study the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-810-arpanet-nodes-by-type-by-date&quot;&gt;Exhibit 8.1.0 Arpanet Nodes by Type By Date&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

     &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The institutional noose forcing Roberts to divest Arpanet tightened considerably on March 23, 1972, when a Department of Defense (DOD) directive changed the agency’s name to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and made it a civilian-directed agency reporting directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; It also limited DARPA’s responsibilities to the conduct of ”basic and applied research and development for advanced projects.” And although never a practice, DARPA was precluded from creating separate Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;amp;D) facilities. In addition, limits were set as to the maximum funds any one R&amp;amp;D organization could be awarded in a year. Fortunately, Roberts had already anticipated the hidden-yet-clear message to divest Arpanet; although he lacked a solution other than hoping BBN would come to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts’ plans to transfer Arpanet suffered a setback when three members of the BBN committee BBN studying whether BBN wanted to commercialize the Arpanet became so frustrated they left BBN and announced they were going to start a company offering data communication network services. Their product would be “conceptually similar”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; to Arpanet. They saw the Arpanet technologies as public property, having been funded with public money, and presumed they would be given rights to the technology because it “theoretically should be available to us and to others.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; In fact, they even told people that they had “been reassured informally of this by the Defense Dept.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBN’s management felt pressured to act. Needing someone to lead the effort, they began recruiting Roberts to leave IPTO and become President of the Telenet Communications Corp. (Telenet) subsidiary they had created in December 1971. BBN’s timing could not have been better. Roberts had decided already that once the fate of Arpanet had been resolved, it would be time for him to leave IPTO, having already stayed longer than he would have ever expected and longer than was the cultural norm. So Roberts, in his inimitable style, dove into analyzing the opportunity and concluded $10-20 million dollars of computer-time usage resulted in an “optimally cost-effective” nationwide network of roughly fourteen moderately sized computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; Convinced of Telenet’s economic feasibility, Roberts accepted BBN’s offer. But he needed time to avoid any appearances of “conflict of interest;” especially with regard to divesting Arpanet. For help, he suggested that RAND, the research organization, study the alternatives and make a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On being offered the assignment, Keith Uncapher, the Director of the Computer Sciences Division of RAND, immediately thought of involving Paul Baran. Baran had left RAND in 1968 to found the Institute for the Future to study the question of how society solved problems with long lead times.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; Baran readily agreed to consult for RAND. RAND management then realized the March DOD directive had set limits restricting how many dollars could be given to a research institution and RAND had reached their limit. Baran remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I said; ‘Oh, what the heck. I’ll start a company, if you don’t mind, RAND, and do the study, if DARPA doesn’t object, and DARPA wants it.’ So that’s where Cabledata Associates first got started, doing a study on the divestiture of the Arpanet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran contacted Cerf, who had just started teaching at Stanford University only a mile down the road. Cerf also took little convincing to help Cabledata Associates (CDA). With Baran serving as principal investigator and Cerf as project scientist, work began by the summer of 1972 with a report due by January 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet no sooner had CDA started work, than the three ex-employees of BBN, Lee Talbert (President), Ralph Alter (Operations vice-president) and Stephen Russell (Engineering vice-president), founded Packet Communications, Inc. (PCI) in July 1972. They announced they had venture-capital backing, had secured rights to the Arpanet technology, and would be submitting their application to offer data communication services to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-September, Roberts, frustrated from not having found his replacement and feeling the pressure to join Telenet, took J.C.R. Licklider up on his casual offer to take Roberts’ job if he could not find a successor. On October 1, 1972, Roberts announced his resignation from IPTO to become President of Telenet and, on the following day, Telenet filed its application with the FCC. Three months later, PCI submitted their application. Both applications would be approved as regulated common carrier undertakings even though they were going to lease lines from AT&amp;amp;T, itself already a regulated common carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new market was forming. At first the focus would be selling data communication services. In the future, firms would sell packet switching products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Packet switching services and products would prove less important than another market that would emerge from the new paradigm of packet switching - local area networking - the larger story being told in this chapter. As for PCI, it never raised sufficient venture capital and faded away, Telenet became a public company in December 1977 with a market capitalization of $20.6 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; On June 13, 1979, General Telephone Company, the second largest telephone company, bought Telenet for approximately $58 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; BBN received $13.9 million for their cumulative investment of $5.3 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16/a&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time CDA submitted its recommendation on January 14, 1974, the horse had clearly left the barn. Even so, and reflecting CDA’s deep concern if a few firms came to dominate packet switching as an oligopoly, they recommended a new institutional form, a consortium, that would provide “three essential functions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A Clearinghouse mechanism for transferring payments among cooperating entities.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A mechanism for creating and enforcing common industry standards.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A mechanism to allow continuously free and open entry, to avoid the formation of any closed oligopolistic structure that will demand close governmental supervision or regulation.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOD had its concerns as well and after another year of meetings exploring alternatives, including the recommendations of CDA, the management of Arpanet was transferred from DARPA to Defense Communications Agency (DCA) on July 1, 1975.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the ICCC, the indefatigable Robert Kahn left BBN for DARPA to begin planning the world’s first packet radio network. The consummate engineer, he had the experiences of both Arpanet and ALOHAnet to inform his judgment. As Kahn notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ALOHA system was to packet radio like the original timesharing computer was to Arpanet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahn soon convened an informal working group, including Vint Cerf and Robert Metcalfe, to stimulate his thinking and engage their interests. Two challenges had to be met if they were to interconnect the packet radio network with the Arpanet. First, known problems with the communications protocol of Arpanet - the Network Control Protocol, or NCP - had to be solved. Second, a means to interface a packet radio network to Arpanet had to be conceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most glaring problem with NCP was the lack of end-to-end, or Host-to-Host, error-correction. In the Arpanet, NCP error correction was provided for packet routing between the IMPs but not for messages passed between the Hosts and the IMPs. Yet in operation, errors did occur and thus no end-to-end reliability in Arpanet existed. The probability of errors from a roaming packet radio terminal would be significantly greater than the hard-wired terminals of Arpanet. In a radio network, signals could be affected by static in the air or other radio signals, or be disrupted when communicating terminals entered tunnels or buildings. There were other functions subsumed within NCP that also needed to be elevated to the Host level such as flow control and packet segmentation. So NCP needed to be redesigned both for a better functioning Arpanet as well as to support interconnection of a radio network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second challenge was how to interconnect the comparatively slow Arpanet to a fast packet radio network. Arpanet was designed assuming link speeds of 50 kilobits per second (kbps). A packet radio network would operate at 100 to 400 kbps. At first the mismatch in operating speeds seemed to have an easy solution: create a gateway between the two networks that converted the messages from one network into acceptable messages for the other network. A gateway had its problems, however, especially if there were many gateways/networks and terminals roved from one to another. NCP assumed there was only one network much less gateways or the even more complicated situation of a terminal sending a message to one gateway and expecting an answer on another, potentially not pre-determinable, gateway. So NCP had to be re-thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1973, at the AFIPS NCC conference in New York City, Kahn chaired a meeting to discuss the Host-to-Host protocol issues.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; Following the meeting, Kahn and Cerf began the uncertain task of redesigning NCP.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In November 1971, Louis Pouzin joined the Delegation a l’Informatique, an agency of the French government responsible for coordinating all activities related to computing. He would be responsible for creating France’s first computer communication network. His first official act was to travel to the United States and re-establish contacts he had made when at MIT (1962-1965), and to better understand the mysterious Arpanet.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; Pouzin recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I took a round trip to the United States to see how the Arpanet was being developed. I was introduced to the major Arpanet developers including the people at BBN, Larry Roberts, Vint Cerf, the people at SRI, and Len Kleinrock, whom I had known before. I had read the papers on Arpanet before my trip but it looked to me a little bit abstract. I couldn’t really grasp the realities. After my trip to the States, I understood how they started, how they were organized, what the major tasks were in developing the system, and where the deficiencies were. They explained to me all their compromises and the unfinished things they had encountered. We started discussing how to improve that. They understood that I intended to build another network but they really didn’t believe it. They had this feeling that the Arpanet, this kind of complicated system, could only be implemented in a country like the States due to money, expertise and so on. They didn’t believe Europe could bring something like that up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After returning to Paris, Pouzin began designing the computer communications network and organizing a conference of Europeans interested in networking. Most participants attending the June 1972 meeting were French. Notable exceptions were Steve Crocker of DARPA, Donald Davies of the NPL and Peter Kirstein of University College, London. Two decisions came easy. First, they agreed they needed to meet again and function much like the Network Working Group, NWG, of Arpanet. So they assumed the name of the International Network Working Group or INWG. Second, they agreed the institutional conditions of Europe were very different from those in the United States. How to work with the all-powerful Public Telephone and Telegraph companies (PTTs) and their omnipotent standards-making body, the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT), was bound to be complicated and time consuming. Most attendees believed they needed the credibility and authority of an existing organization to level the playing field. Pouzin, a member of the newly created International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Technical Committee 6 (TC 6) on Data Communications, suggested INWG look into affiliating with IFIP, a body of computer scientists interested in international harmony and information sharing organized under the auspices of the United Nations. The INWG members authorized Pouzin to talk with Alex Curan, chairman of IFIP TC-6. They also scheduled the next meeting for November at the University of Kent, England, after the upcoming ICCC demonstration in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, Pouzin returned to his task of designing a simpler packet switching network than Arpanet. In the process, he spent time studying the NPL network and, to the extent he had access to information, the MERIT, TYMNET and INTENET networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Pouzin was certain networking would evolve differently in Europe due to the power of the PTT’s: whereas the monopolistic powers of AT&amp;amp;T were being weakened, the monopolistic PTT’s remained unchallenged. To think a distinct communications network could be superimposed on top of the PTT’s networks, as Arpanet was on AT&amp;amp;T’s, seemed simply naive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1972, just weeks after the heady experience of ICCC, the workshop at the University of Kent convened. With the Arpanet success serving as both an inspiration to those with computer communication ideas and a proof of principal to be improved upon, workshop organizers hoped to foster new collaborations. Participants from the United States, Canada, Japan and several European countries heard presentations on Arpanet, the NPL of Davies, and the network Pouzin was planning called CYCLADES. (See Exhibit 6.2 The CYCLADES Network.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 8.3.0 The CYCLADES Network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.3.0_CYCLADES_network.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of the CYCLADES network&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CYCLADES was to be a pure datagram network. CYCLADES would consist of Host computers connected to packet switches that interconnected using PTT provided telephone circuits. Software in the Host computers would create virtual circuits between Hosts on the network and partition the data to be communicated into datagrams. Hosts would then send the datagrams to their packet switches that forwarded them to the appropriate packet switches that in turn passed the datagrams to their Hosts. The packet switches and the network links were called Cigale - the Subnet in Arpanet. CYCLADES differed radically from Arpanet in that Hosts sent datagrams directly between Hosts and provided end-to-end error correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pouzin used a datagram scheme knowing there was simply no way to impose error correction, or ordering of packet responsibilities, onto the PTT’s. And as had been learned in Arpanet, even if the packet switches communicated error-free, there could be no guarantee that errors were not introduced by communications between the Hosts and the packet switches. Pouzin’s elegant design isolated CYCLADES from the authority and complications of the PTT’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In placing responsibility for reliable end-to-end, datagram communications in the communicating computers, and proving the architecture could work, CYCLADES would have continuing repercussions for the future of computer communications. Pouzin recalls his thinking at the time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The inspiration for datagrams had two sources. One was Donald Davies’ studies. He had done some simulation of datagram networks, although he had not built any, and it looked technically viable. The second inspiration was I like things simple. I didn’t see any real technical motivation to overlay two levels of end-to-end protocols. I thought one was enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pouzin hoped to have CYCLADES working by the end of 1973. By then his would not be the only important network project in Europe. In 1971, the COST 11 Project&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; was a multi-nation European initiated research network and a virtual copy of CYCLADES.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; In 1973, COST 11 was renamed the European Informatics Network (EIN) and Derek Barber of NPL became the project director. Closely associated with both CYCLADES and EIN were the leading computer companies of Europe, including Olivetti, ICL, Siemens and CII (Compagnie Internationale pour l’Informatique); firms that recognized if they did not provide an alternative to the PTT’s data communication products, they risked abdicating much of their communications futures. These computer manufacturers composed the core of the European Computer Manufacturers’ Association (ECMA), an organization coordinating mutually advantageous industrial policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every researcher thought as Pouzin did however. One of his countrymen, Remy Despres, managed the experimental packet switched network of the French PTT called Reseau a Commutation par Paquets (RCP). Announced in November 1973, RCP was based on the PTTs providing virtual circuits and not just communication links. RCP was to serve as a test bed for the public packet network the French PTT’s was planning named TRANSPAC. Despres would find allies the following year in Roberts and Wessler of Telenet who had concluded that Telenet’s packet switching products had to be based on virtual circuits if they hoped to land PTTs as customers. The PTTs could charge more for the reliable transmission of information - that is by providing virtual circuit networks - than simply the provisioning of links.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The confusion over how to best design a computer communications network also embroiled the debates within the group now named IFIP Working Group 6.1. In 1973, when Pouzin approached Alex Curran, chairman of IFIP TC-6, regarding the recently formed INWG becoming associated with IFIP TC-6, he readily agreed and they renamed INWG: IFIP Working Group 6.1 (WG 6.1) on Network Interconnection. Steve Crocker, chairman of the original Arpanet NWG, recommended Vint Cerf became Chairman, a suggestion readily approved. Quickly the WG 6.1 meetings became a must for anyone wanting to influence computer communications. For what was recognized by but a handful of people in mid-1973 became, in the short span of twenty-four months, received knowledge by nearly all those involved in computer communications: the world was going to be populated by many computer networks, networks that inevitably would need to be interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only how could the complexities of inter-network communications be resolved when the technological details of what constituted a best network remained an open question? And what were to be the roles of the firms of the two enabling markets: telecommunications and computers? So even though not a standards making body, for a few critical years the who’s who of computer communications debated the future of networks and their coming together at IFIP WG 6.1 meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All agreed Arpanet represented a good first proof that a better network than one designed using the circuit-switching model of the telephone system could be built. Arpanet had its deficiencies, however, for it was neither a true datagram network nor did it provide end-to-end error correction. So the big question remained: could a true packet network with end-to-end reliability be created? WG 6.1 debates struggled with the issue of how to design a network that was based on datagrams but provided virtual circuits. Indeed, it was a fundamental barrier to the next step for networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1973, at a meeting in Sussex, England, Cerf and Kahn presented a communication protocol Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, that functioned over interconnected networks of many kinds. Their paper was published by the IEEE Transactions on Communications in May 1974 as A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; TCP incorporated end-to-end virtual circuits with datagram transmission and gateways between networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized from a solution of how to interconnect Arpanet with a packet radio network, Cerf and Kahn proposed different networks be interconnected by gateways with TCP functioning across both networks and gateways. Gateways would receive incoming traffic from one network and perform whatever transformations were necessary in order to send the data over the outgoing network. One transformation would be protocol conversions. Another, more contentious transformation was fragmenting packet or datagram size: if the outgoing network required a smaller packet size than the incoming network, then the gateway would fragment the packet into multiple packets before resending. Only this required receiving hosts to be informed of gateway created fragmentations in order to reconstruct the fragmented packets into the original transmission. One transmission could span many networks and potentially be fragmented multiple times. Cerf and Kahn wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If a GATEWAY fragments an incoming packet into two or more packets, they must eventually be passed along to the destination HOST as fragments or reassembled for the HOST. It is conceivable that one might desire the GATEWAY to perform the reassembly to simplify the task of the destination HOST (or process) and/or to take advantage of a larger packet size. We take the position that GATEWAYS should not perform this function since GATEWAY reassembly can lead to serious buffering problems, potential deadlocks, the necessity for all fragments of a packet to pass through the same GATEWAY, and increased delay in transmission. Furthermore, it is not sufficient for the GATEWAYS to provide this function since the final GATEWAY may also have to fragment a packet for transmission. Thus the destination HOST must be prepared to do this task.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This solution immediately raised red flags for Pouzin and the Europeans concerned with any network design that forced hosts to have to correct errors introduced by network operators, i.e. the PTT’s. Coupling the correction of host-to-host errors with network-to-network errors meant that the protocols used by the computers and PTT’s would have to be coupled, and that seemed like a sure way both to cede control to the PTT’s, and to end-up with a sub-optimum computer communication system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1974, Pouzin responded to the Cerf and Kahn memo (IFIP WG 6.1 document CEKA74) with a proposal of his own: A Proposal for Interconnecting Packet Switching Networks (INWG60). It stimulated more revisions and proposals by both sides. Then in November 1974, the Europeans’ concerns soared when the CCITT decided to establish a standard interface to packet switching networks they would offer (X.25).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; In December, in hopes of forging a solution of one internetwork protocol, Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine submitted document INWG72: Specifications of Internetwork  Transmission Control Program (revised). The revision set forth a windowing scheme to end the fragmentation arguments. Pouzin remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Vint and Bob Kahn and probably a few others, like Yogen Dalal, tried to use this window scheme: a single packet could be fragmented in a number of packets along the way, all of them would arrive out of order, and still they would use the very same window scheme to control the flow. It was technically tricky – I mean smart, but we didn’t buy the idea because we thought it was first, too complex in implementation, and much too hard to sell to industry.  The second thing is it mingled – it actually handled in the very same protocol, matters that belong to the transport level, and matters that belong to the end-to-end protocol.  That kind of coupling was politically unacceptable, because these two levels of system were handled by two different worlds: The PTTs and the other world, the computer people. So obviously it was not acceptable in terms of technical sociology. You could not sell something that involves the consensus of these two different worlds. So we thought that was not a good way of organizing things, even though it was technically sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The struggle to find a common solution had sharpened understandings of how to design both a network, be it either datagram or virtual circuit, and an interconnected network of many networks. Cerf remembers those difficult years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So for years, there was this religious battle between people who had datagram style networks and people who had virtual circuit style nets. The international PTT efforts went down the path of virtual circuits while the R &amp;amp; D community generally stuck with a datagram style of operations. What happened as a result is that the R &amp;amp; D community had to come to grips with a much more challenging underlying communications environment where datagrams weren’t guaranteed. If you sent one, it might get clobbered by something else, or it might get lost, or it might get thrown away because of congestion. The higher-level protocols that operated on top of the basic datagram mode had to be far more robust and have more mechanisms in them for flow control and retransmission and duplicate detection’s than the protocols that were evolving on the basis of virtual circuits. So these communities really went in different directions. They used to fight tooth and nail with each other, and I was out there fighting too. I was beating the table saying: ‘God damn it, it had to be datagrams because that required less of a network and you had to do things end-to-end anyway, because you wanted to have the mainframes assure the other end that they had really gotten the data, and not just that the network thinks that you got it,’ so there were a lot of arguments along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Kahn and DARPA the debate needed to end. They wanted to code TCP and see if it would work. In early 1975, DARPA gave three contracts to test whether the TCP specifications were detailed and explicit enough to enable different implementations to function seamlessly. The three teams were headed by Cerf at Stanford, Ray Tomlinson and Bill Plummer at BBN, and by Peter Kirstein at University College in London, England. Pouzin understood the significance of implementing TCP:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After that, they sort of froze their design, but then we started to become disinterested because we didn’t think it could really work.  So then we started to skirt the issue and considered that as something we couldn’t avoid because they had the whole ARPA backing behind them, so we thought we couldn’t stop that.  On the other hand, we had quite a good feeling that they would not invade Europe very much, so we started to organize our thing in Europe differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European members concluded that they needed the support of a standards making body to advance their cause – IFIP not being a standards making body – and so they approached the International Standards Organization (ISO) in late 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1976, in an attempt to bridge the differences between the TCP and European communities, Alex McKenzie, of BBN, re-crafted an international protocol to satisfy both the demands of those wanting a total end-to-end protocol and those wanting the end-to-end and network-to-network functions separated. A paper authored by McKenzie, Cerf, Scantlebury and Zimmermann discussing the protocol was submitted to the IFIP and subsequently published in Computer Communications Review.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately it proved too little too late. As Cerf underscores, he could not “persuade the TCP community to adopt the compromise given the state of implementation experience of TCP at the time and the untested nature of the IFIP document.”&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Competitive products from start-ups, such as Tymshare and Telenet, employed variations of packet switching. University networks also tended to employ traditional techniques and, while generally confined to a single campus, multiple universities sometimes joined together to form an “educational computing network,” such as the MERIT Network of Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More adventuresome networking projects tended to be funded by either the military or government research agencies. An example of a sophisticated network developed by a government agency was the Octopus system at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In contrast to most of those who came to computer communications from 1965 to 1972, David Farber had an extensive background in both communications and computers. In 1956, Farber joined Bell Labs of AT&amp;amp;T working in communication systems. During his ten-year stay, he learned about computers and the needs of ‘real users’ as director of the computer center at Holmdel, N.J., and secretary to the IBM users’ group SHARE. In 1966, he joined RAND where he spent two years and came under the influence of Paul Baran’s work. Next he joined Scientific Data Systems (SDS), a Division of Xerox, and taught evening courses at UC Irvine. In late 1969, Farber accepted a two-year appointment as Acting Associate Professor UC Irvine (UCI) and given two years to earn a permanent appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One question summarized Farber’s interest: “Could I use a whole bunch of these minicomputers together to form a more effective computation environment?” In early 1970, still undecided as to what would qualify as something important, he attended an IEEE conference in Georgia and heard Abramson’s first public presentation of the ALOHAnet. Capturing Farber’s attention, however, was a talk on communication rings by John Newhall and David Farmer of Bell Labs. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What triggered me on, more than anything else, was the notion that there was technology for local networking. So I went back to Irvine and started thinking of a set of objectives, and remember, I have two years to come up with a project, to get it funded, and to get enough published on it, enough work done, so in two years I could go up for a permanent position. Good Trick!  The things that drive technology are always fun. During that period, I wanted to see just how decentralized I could make an environment. I knew that I could certainly build something similar to the IBM token passing loops to communicate between processors, and I could certainly build a master/slave processor. I helped do that at SDS. And so the objectives of what became known as the Distributed Computer System, DCS, was to see if we could do total distribution. No vulnerable point of error. With both communications and processing and software that was completely decentralized. We certainly didn’t want to duplicate the central control box in the Newhall and Farmer ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farber, Rusty Barbero, a young faculty member, and a couple of graduate students began “throwing ideas around;” ideas based on the token ring concepts elaborated by Newhall and Farmer. Two questions focused their inquiries: “Is it feasible to build a completely decentralized token ring?” and “Can we build a token ring, a communication system, that supports the type of software paradigms that we wanted?” Again Farber:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the early days, you talk about specific machines that you communicate with. Well, there was no way we were going to do things different if user software knew about specific machines, even indirectly. So we thought of the idea of having software that would couple together by sending detached messages back and forth to each other. Now that’s to my knowledge, the first presentation of message based processing. Further, if there were going to be messages to pass back and forth, couldn’t we do it in such a way that the addresses were independent of the machines that the programs ran on? So we evolved this idea that we were going to have a process structured software system, with messages that were process addressed. So I want to send a message to somebody, to some program, once I knew its name I just sort of sent it to that program and the underlying communication system would take care of it for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farber submitted a proposal for funding to the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1970, asking for about $250,000 a year, a large grant. Farber recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It got awarded, which surprised everybody including me, and so now the problem was to make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Distributed Computer System would consist of a series of minicomputers, terminal controllers and File Machines interconnected together by a token ring network. Farber initially wanted to buy PDP-11s from Digital Equipment Corporation but, fortuitously, ended up using a PDP-11 clone from Lockheed Corporation called the SUE. Lockheed was in the core memory business and began selling computers as a way to put “some iron under their memories.” The SUE came with minimal software, forcing Farber’s team to write all the software they needed, including a compiler. If they had used the PDP-11s, they “might have ended up with a kludge because there was a fair amount of software for the 11.” They would connect each SUE to a shared twisted pair wire using a specially designed token ring circuit board called a ring interface. The inter-device communication architecture mimicked the Bell System digital T-1 specification with the modification of fixed-length messages with a bandwidth of 2.5 megabits per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A token ring network interconnects devices as node-to-node connections that close into a ring. Each node consists of a device, such as a computer, with a special printed circuit board connecting to the transmission media. (See Exhibit 6.3 Token Ring) In the case of the UCI network, the transmission media was twisted pair wire. The nodes, or stations, of the network are granted the right to communicate by passing a token, a unique bit pattern – usually eight-bits of ones – from node to node. If the node wants to communicate, it waits for the token to be passed to it which means it is authorized to communicate, then seizes the token and appends its message. Once sent, the token automatically passes to the next node, which repeats the process. If a node has nothing to send, it simply passes the token on to the next node. Since every node receives the token within a known time, bounded by whether all the other nodes have data to communicate or not, a token ring network is, by definition, deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1973, Farber presented a paper at the International Conference of IEEE Computer Society even though the network did not yet work. He remembers: “A lot of the things back in those days were published before they were built. Dangerous game, but quite often, certainly necessary in the academic world.” NSF approved the contract renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late 1973, they completed the software needed to connect a computer to the network. Expecting to take a week or two to get a multinode network functioning, they had a three-computer network passing tokens in a day. As Farber remembers: “ It went very fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 1974, they had a semi-stable network. Again Farber:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At that point it got very popular, and it was a very strange situation. People started hearing about it and we would get these phone calls saying: ‘We’d like to come down and see it.’ We’d say: ‘You mean you want to talk?’ They would respond: ‘No, we want to see it!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farber and his team at UCI proved that another way existed for linking distributed computers. However, their interest was distributed software systems and not advancing computer communications. So they did little to actively promote their token ring technology. But their success would not go unnoticed. In just a few years, their token ring technology -technology funded by the government and thus in the public domain - would be resurrected in response to market demands emanating from Xerox’s refusal to sell its local area networking technology, a technology developed by Robert Metcalfe at Xerox PARC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-860-token-ring&quot;&gt;Exhibit 8.6.0 Token Ring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.6.0_token_ring.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of token ring network&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/8.7/Ethernet-and-Robert-Metcalfe-and-Xerox-PARC-1971-1975/",

Metcalfe thought them insensitive to all the hard work and hopeful visions he and his colleagues shared - another example of the abusive, arbitrary behavior of those with authority and power. Admittedly his ire may have been easily provoked, for his world had been thrown into disarray by a felt injustice suffered just months earlier. To understand Metcalfe’s state of mind and how his unrelenting resolve set him on the course to invent the seminal local area networking technology of Ethernet requires us to return to the end of 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked by Kahn to help with the organization of the ICCC, Metcalfe had every reason to feel he had earned his way into the inner circle of those giving birth to the Arpanet. So despite the fact that the first half of 1972 already loomed as too busy to contemplate – his PhD thesis had to be finished and defended in June and he had to find a job, one that would hopefully start in July – Metcalfe agreed to help. His uninformed decision two years earlier to focus on networking, and then to write his thesis on the Arpanet, now seemed uncannily prescient, as if some predestined momentum were sweeping him forward into a larger future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews confirmed his sense of being part of something important. Most opportunities smacked of bringing others up to speed, of transferring what he already knew and little appreciation for how much needed to be redone. The same could not be said for his interviews with Jerry Elkind and Robert Taylor, dual heads of the Computer Science Lab of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Elkind and Taylor, formerly of BBN and IPTO respectively, challenged him not simply to extend his Arpanet experiences, but to join a team dedicated to building a new paradigm of “office automation.” He liked everything he heard, including the Bay Area location, and agreed to start in July, after defending his PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early spring, ICCC responsibilities took Metcalfe to Washington D. C. and, as usual, he stayed at the home of his good friend, Steve Crocker. After a customary late evening of spirited conversation, Metcalfe retired to his bed, the living room couch. Restless, he grabbed the 1970 Proceedings of the Fall Joint Computer Conference off the adjacent coffee table in hopes of reading himself to sleep, but his attention immediately focused on an article by Norm Abramson titled: The ALOHA System – Another alternative for computer communications. Metcalfe vividly remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m reading this paper about how the ALOHAnet worked, statistically. The model Abramson used was infuriating to me. Infuriating, because it was based on a model that was tractable but inaccurate. In other words, you assume a bunch of things about a system that make the mathematics do-able, but the assumptions are highly questionable. So I’m reading Abramson’s work and it struck me the same way, which is:  Assume that you have an infinite number of people sitting at keyboards, and they just type. No matter what happens they just keep typing. Even if they get no answer they just keep typing. Let’s see how the system performs. Well, when I read that, I said: ‘But people don’t. They DO stop typing! I mean if they don’t get an answer, they wait. This is not accurate.’ Now it was Poisson processes and exponential distributions and all that stuff that you can just math to death, and it all works out in a beautiful closed form formula. The trouble was, in my mind, that the ALOHA system was not being properly modeled. Mind you at the time, I was a graduate student dying to find some mathematics to put in my thesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a confident Metcalfe presented his thesis to his Harvard professors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was rejected, and I was thrown out on my ass! But, imagine the scene - Here’s this graduate student who did all of his work at MIT, shows up to defend his thesis among a bunch of professors for whom he had carried no water for the preceding three years and they are asked to make a judgment on the intellectual content of my thesis. I got blown out of the water by them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe’s thesis was rejected for not being sufficiently mathematical or theoretical. A stunned Metcalfe, doubting he could find the needed new, undiscovered, theoretical or mathematical content in Arpanet, decided he had to go to Hawaii and learn more about the ALOHAnet. Contacting Abramson, he received a gracious invitation. Then he had to convince his new employer to give him the needed time off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On hearing Metcalfe’s disappointing news, PARC management couldn’t have been more supportive. Other than bringing PARC up on the Arpanet, their IMP would not be installed until October, Metcalfe was given the freedom to do what he needed to do to beef-up his thesis and satisfy his commitments to Kahn. Before leaving for Hawaii, Metcalfe, PARC’s new “networking guru,” received a briefing on the Data General Nova 800’s and the Multi-Processor Communications Adapter (MCA) that would interconnect them. The MCA was a 16-bit parallel cable connecting one machine to the next carrying data at 1.5 megabits per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hawaii, a serious minded Metcalfe focused on what he needed to learn and, other than playing a few games of tennis and tipping a few beers with two of Abramson’s graduate students, Charlie Bass and John Davidson, he worked and did little else. Abramson remembers: “We went out to dinner a couple of times, that kind of interaction, and he was rather closed-mouthed about what he was doing and I didn’t want to push him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the ALOHAnet, Metcalfe began constructing mathematical models and comparing the results to actual data. He also modeled what would happen if people only typed when they got answers; and when they received no answer, they stopped and waited until they did – a condition known as blocking. Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This had a dramatic effect on how your observed system would perform. And in the process of doing that modeling, it became obvious the system had some stability problems. That is, when it got full, it got a lot of retransmissions. That means if you overloaded it too much it would slip off the deep end. But in the process of modeling that with a finite population model, meaning people stop typing when they did not get an answer, I saw an obvious way to fix the stability problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had studied some control theory at MIT and this was a control problem. That is, the more collisions you got, the less aggressive you should be about transmitting. You should calm down. And, in fact, the model I used was the Santa Monica freeway. It turns out that the throughput characteristics of freeway traffic are similar to that of an ALOHA system, which means that the throughput goes up with offered traffic to a certain point where you have congestion and then the throughput actually goes down with additional traffic, which is why you get traffic jams. The simple phenomenon is that, psychologically, people tend to go slower when they’re closer to the car in front of them so as the cars get closer and closer together and people slow down the throughput goes down, so they get closer and closer and the system degrades. So it was a really simple step to take the ALOHA network, and when you sent a message and you got a collision, you would just take that as evidence that the network was crowded. So, when you went to re transmit, you’d relax for a while, a random while, and then try again. If you got another collision you would say “Whoa, its REALLY crowded’, and you’d randomize and back off a little. So the ‘carrier sense’ expression meant ‘Is there anybody on there yet?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, the ALOHA system didn’t do that, they just launched. So, therefore, a lot of the bandwidth was consumed in collisions that could have been avoided if you just checked. And collision detection was, while you’re transmitting, because of distance separations, its possible for two computers to check then decide to send and then send and then later discover that there was a collision. So, if while you were sending, you monitored your transmission, you could notice if there was a collision, at which point you would stop immediately. That tended to minimize the amount of bandwidth wasted on collisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe did not yet realize that his seminal insight of collision detection would have important implications once back at PARC when confronted with interconnecting many computers. Metcalfe presented his findings at a University of Hawaii systems conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to PARC, Metcalfe dove into the problems of interconnecting the PARC computers to the Arpanet and writing up the Scenarios for the upcoming ICCC show. When he finally surfaced for air in late October, both projects completed, PARC management challenged him to conceive and develop a communications network able to support the needs of many Altos computers and peripherals such as the also-being-developed laser printers. This “next generation” computing environment posed unprecedented communication requirements because of the use of bit-mapped graphics both as user interface and document output. Voluminous computer communications would be routine, not the exception as with Arpanet. If the required communications could not be reliably supported, PARC’s new vision of computing might prove to be just a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Metcalfe, PARC management understood they were trying to create a new paradigm of computing and proprietary innovation could create competitive barriers-to-entry. They had no interest Metcalfe replicating work of others, encouraging him instead to view the problem with an unbiased perspective and engineer a best solution. For Metcalfe, management’s mandate impelled him to treat his growing intuition of computer communications not just as thesis-driven speculation, but an opportunity worth seizing. In short, a prepared and motivated individual had encountered inviting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe fully understood the dynamic state of computer communications and scanned the literature for any relevant developments that might influence his work. On learning of Farber’s work at UCI, he obtained a copy of his February IEEE paper. (Metcalfe: “We became friendly arch rivals.”) He also contacted Cerf, an assistant professor now just ten minutes away at Stanford, and started attending his graduate seminar on networking; soon becoming an instructor. In early 1973, Metcalfe participated in the discussions Cerf and Kahn were having as to how to redesign the Arpanet NCP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 22, 1973, Metcalfe distributed a memo marked Xerox sensitive to the ALTO ALOHA team. The subject: Ether Acquisition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; To quote from the cover page:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Here is more rough stuff on the ALTO ALOHA network.I propose we stop calling this thing &quot;the ALTO ALOHA Network&quot;. First, because it should support any number of different kinds of station -- say, NOVA, PDP-11, ...... Second, because the organization is beginning to look very much more beautiful than the ALOHA radio network -- to use Charles's &quot;beautiful&quot;.Maybe:  &quot;The ETHER Network&quot;. Suggestions?I hope to be simulating soon. Help? Inputs?I hope you will not be offended by my attempts to make this thinking and design appear theoretical.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the memo, Metcalfe discusses the ETHER Network:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;We plan to build a so-called broadcast computer communication network, not unlike the ALOHA System's radio network, but specifically for in-building minicomputer communications. We think in terms of NOVA's and ALTO's joined by coaxial cables.While we may end up using coaxial cable trees to carry our broadcast transmissions, it seems wise to talk in terms of an ether, rather than 'the cable', for as long as possible. This will keep things general and who knows what other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network; maybe radio or telephone circuits, or power wiring or frequency-multi-plexed CATV, or microwave environments, or even combinations thereof.The essential feature of our medium -- the ether -- is that it carries transmissions, propagates bits to all stations. We are to investigate the applicability of ether networks.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe explains the ether:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And what the ether was, the original ether was, was an omnipresent passive medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves. It was going to be a medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves, data packets, hence the cable is the ether. So it was an ether, and it was a network using an ether, so it was an Ether Net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe remembers encountering Leonard Kleinrock at Washington National Airport and showing him the mathematics in his PhD. thesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He told me it was: ‘Not very rigorous.’ He pooh-poohed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By May, Metcalfe had finished adding the mathematics of how the ALOHAnet worked to his thesis and re-submitted it to his new thesis advisor, Jeff Busen. This time it was accepted and Metcalfe received his PhD. in June 1973. Metcalfe notes ironically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indicative of how I got it – Harvard University did not publish my PhD. thesis. It was published by MIT, Project MAC, where I had done all the work. So it was the thesis finished at Xerox, for a Harvard PhD. thesis, published by MIT - Mac Technical Report #114.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Metcalfe was given the go-ahead to build a prototype Ethernet.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; (Since Ethernet will become its known name, the convention will be to use it from the beginning.) Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I needed to kind of get the project going; do the logic design, build the boards, write the microcode, etc. And I don’t like to work alone. In fact, I believe the ideal operating unit is two people. Three is too many and one isn’t enough. Two is perfect. So I went out looking for somebody to work with me, and one day, I saw this guy in moccasins with a ponytail down to his back padding his way through Building 34 at PARC. And he didn’t look busy. He looked like he didn’t have enough to do. So, I checked into it and it turned out he was a graduate student from Stanford who was working for David Liddle. So I asked David about him and David said: ‘Well, why don’t you get him to work on your project with you?’ So I approached David R. Boggs and propositioned him and we entered into a two year long project together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethernet project required fleshing out Metcalfe’s preliminary design, building the hardware to attach the computers to the connecting coaxial cable, and designing and coding the networking protocol so computers and peripherals could share information. Metcalfe realized that he needed a more streamlined communications protocol than the NCP of Arpanet or the new protocol being designed by Cerf and Kahn that had to function over may different kinds of networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year-end 1973, as Metcalfe and Boggs progressed from design to implementation, Metcalfe found he had little time to participate in the Cerf-led sessions. He had real project deadlines to meet that required making choices and reducing those choices to hardware and software. Further constraining Metcalfe’s relationship with Cerf was Xerox’s confidentiality requirements that restricted what Metcalfe could disclose to Cerf and his colleagues. Without being able to openly discuss his work, Metcalfe derived little benefit from the more academic and open-ended discussions being moderated by Cerf. Cerf acting under the aegis of DARPA sought to bring about a standard from within a very diverse community having little motivation to cooperate or resolve issues in a fixed time frame. Consequently, the early development of local area networking protocols being pioneered by Metcalfe and Boggs proceeded down a very different path than Cerf’s and Kahn’s redoing of NCP, a digression that would soon become important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe’s design objective for Ethernet was a communication system that could “grow smoothly to accommodate several buildings full of personal computers and facilities needed for their support.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; (Exhibit 6.4 Ethernet) Two secondary, yet desirable, objectives were that it had to be inexpensive and, preferably, distribute control to eliminate the “bottleneck”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt; inherent in centralized control. Metcalfe’s design incorporated architectural contributions from Arpanet and ALOHAnet: packet-based communications with broadcast transmission. Beginning with “the basic idea of packet collision and retransmission developed in the ALOHA Network,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; Metcalfe added his collision detection insight. Computers or peripherals would constantly listen to the communication channel (the “Ether”) and only send – broadcast – their messages when they detected a clear channel. If collisions with packets being sent by other stations were detected, all sending stations would stop transmitting, wait intervals of time in proportion to the frequency of collisions, and retransmit. If collisions occurred again, the transmitting computers would wait a longer interval and retry; repeating the process until successful. What makes Ethernet possible is most messages are short, hundreds or thousands of bits, compared to the communication channel bandwidth of 3 megabits per second - the very same principle recognized a decade earlier by Baran and Davies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final design of the Ethernet network proved elegantly simple: some hardware to interconnect computers and peripherals so they could exchange bits and a networking protocol to make sense of the bits. The hardware consists of interface controllers, transceivers and taps, and a transmission media. An interface controller, or adaptor, connects to the backplane, or bus, of computer equipment (Ethernet stations) and sends and receives formatted data to the transceiver. The transceiver converts the digital data coming from or going to an interface controller to analog signals required by the transmission media (communication facility). In effect, the transceiver acts like a modem. Taps are needed to physically connect transceivers to the transmission media with minimal disruption during connecting or disconnecting.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; And finally, there is the transmission media needed to transport the signals. The first transmission media was coaxial cable, initially with its famous yellow sheathing. To interconnect two or more Ethernets, an additional piece of equipment, a repeater, is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-871-ethernet&quot;&gt;Exhibit 8.7.1 Ethernet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.7.1_Ethernet.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Ethernet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The networking protocol is implemented in software to execute in both the Etherent stations and the interface controllers and provides the essential services of “error correction, flow control, process naming, security and accounting.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt; The networking protocol Metcalfe and Boggs created – PARC Universal Packet, or Pup – leveraged the knowledge and experience gained from ARPA’ s creation of NCP and its recreation being led by Cerf and Kahn. Pup was in fact a hierarchy of protocols that enabled end-to-end functionality, including file transfer and email.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 6.5 Pup Protocol)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late 1974, Metcalfe and Boggs had a 3 megabit per second Ethernet with Pup working. Once successful, Xerox filed for patents covering the Ethernet technology under the names of Metcalfe, Boggs, Butler Lampson and Chuck Thacker. (Metcalfe insisted Lampson, the “intellectual guru under whom we all had the privilege to work” and Thacker “the guy who designed the Altos” names were on the patent.) Once the patent had been filed, Metcalfe and Boggs could publish their work, submitting a paper to the Communications of the ACM titled: Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks. Published in July 1976, it became a seminal paper for all work on local area networks to follow. By mid-1975, PARC had installed a one hundred node Ethernet network that was robust by 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-872-the-pup-protocol&quot;&gt;Exhibit 8.7.2 The Pup Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.7.2_PUP_protocol.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of PUP Protocol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1974, the only effective means computer scientists at MIT had to interconnect their computers were two IMPs, an increasingly unacceptable solution, especially given what was known about Metcalfe’s work, enviously nicknamed “ALOHAnet on a wire.” Thus MIT scientists were challenged to either build or buy local area networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Laboratory acted first. Taxed by their own research agenda, they had little desire to develop their own local area networking technology and approached PARC about buying Ethernet products. Xerox declined the opportunity. Xerox viewed Ethernet as proprietary and integral to their office systems and not a product to be sold separately. Professor Jerry Saltzer, one of the first to become involved in network development for the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Xerox had invented and built the first version of the Ethernet, but still considered it proprietary and would not allow anyone to use the internal knowledge. The fact that it worked was sufficient for someone else to say: ‘Well, in that case, we’ll build one too.’ So the AI Laboratory built Chaosnet. The only reason it was invented was because we couldn’t use Ethernet. Chaosnet was essentially another Ethernet that had slight differences, but the differences aren’t important enough to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the LCS became serious about local area networking. Michael Dertouzos, the head of LCS, Saltzer and Dave Clark, a research associate, directed Ken Pogran to investigate available local area networking technologies. DARPA, learning of LCS’s interests, lobbied MIT to import the token ring technology developed at UC Irvine by Farber, and not create a new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pogran visited PARC and spent a day being briefed by a clean-shaven Metcalfe, a business-like contrast to the Metcalfe he had known during the earlier Arpanet days. Pogran then visited Farber and learned of his plans to create a second generation token ring employing graduate students, not to study token ring per se, but needing an improved token ring to do research in distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his return to MIT, Pogran presented his findings to Dertouzos, Saltzer and Clark. They decided against Chaosnet, concerned that future product support and development they knew they would need would be a low priority for the AI Lab; a serious problem since LCS did not have a hardware development capability as the AI Lab did. Since Xerox wouldn’t share its technology, their only alternatives were either to create a new technology or import UC Irvine’s token ring technology. LCS chose token ring even knowing graduate students were developing the version of the product they would use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LCS began planning what Dertouzos called the “76 Net.” Pogran began as project manager but soon took on direct engineering tasks that no one at UC Irvine had either the time or competence for. Despite his efforts, Pogran could not meet the original schedule, finally delivering working LNI’s (Local Network Interfaces) in 1977 supporting a 1 megabit per second token ring network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same year, 1977, Saltzer, took his sabbatical from MIT, and spent a year working for IBM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was working in White Plains, but I traveled quite a bit, and one of my stops was in Zurich. I discovered that they were interested in token rings so we proceeded to compare notes, and I  basically supplied them with every piece of information we had. The Zurich laboratory had as its charter to do communications, and it was trying to figure out if it could do something useful in the area of local area network communications. At this time, the only local area network in all of Europe was the Cambridge Ring at Cambridge University, U. K. Ethernet was something being done 5,000 miles farther away than a token ring. Xerox was also a competing company and it was hard to get inside to look at what they were doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saltzer’s opinions, based on his early experience with token ring at LCS, reinforced IBM’s historical preference for deterministic, synchronous protocols. The initial diffusion of Farber’s and UC Irvine’s token ring technology to IBM had occurred months earlier with Phillipe Janson. Clark adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Phillipe Janson, after receiving his PhD from MIT in 1976, joined IBM in Zurich. It’s my belief that when Zurich was looking to build a network, and they didn’t want to build an Ethernet because they had a strong dose of ‘not invented here,’ and Janson was the one that suggested that they ought to build rings based on his experience at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;LCS Network represented an incremental innovation on the token ring technology imported from UC Irvine. For example, concerned with finding wiring faults, the LCS Network connected each network node through a central “wiring closet,” giving rise to a star topology that would become standard for future token ring networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

He wanted the energy and excitement of engaging in leading edge research, but he also wanted the satisfaction from succeeding in putting ideas to use. He wanted to be more than an engineer. In November 1975, he left Xerox PARC for Transaction Technology, Inc. an advanced product development organization of Citibank. In just seven months, he was wooed back to Xerox by David Liddle to join the newly formed Systems Development Division (SDD).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt; SDD’s charter specifically called for the commercialization of the Altos technologies, including Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercializing the Altos technologies required more than simply selling what existed. The entire system, including Ethernet, had to be reengineered to improve performance, reduce costs and made ready for manufacturing. The initial goal for Ethernet was to increase performance from 3 megabits per second to 20 megabits per second and commensurably improve PUP.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddle remembers the controversy surrounding the decision to increase the throughput, or bandwidth, of Ethernet to 20 megabits per second:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The people at PARC complained about this a lot, and said: ‘Why isn’t three megabits good enough?’ We simply said: ‘We didn’t think three megabits would be good enough over this time horizon,’ because we thought there would be more movement of big files and databases and printing big images, and the product was really virtually playing almost the role of a bus, not an old-fashion ‘beep, beep, beep’ communication line. This was somewhat controversial because it increased the cost and subtlety of designing some of the components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late summer 1976, Metcalfe needed to find someone knowledgeable with the latest in protocol developments, including TCP, to lead the redo of Pup protocol. Metcalfe understood the design of Ethernet inside and out, but felt like an outsider looking in when it came to protocol development. Fortunately just such a experienced person existed, Yogen Dalal. Metcalfe knew Dalal and held him in high regard. Dalal would be completing his Ph.D. under Cerf at Stanford in early 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing Dalal would not be easy for he also was being strenuously recruited by Kahn at DARPA, Tomlinson at BBN, Taylor at PARC and Steve Crocker at Information Sciences Institute. What gave Metcalfe an edge was Dalal’s abiding interest in communication protocols. In 1975, he had been a member of Cerf’s team coding and testing TCP. Dalal was also a member of the TCP Working Group and deeply involved in the effort to architect a second version of TCP to reflect what had been learned in the testing and use of the first version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independently, in September 1976, Dalal’s mentor, Cerf, suddenly resigned both his teaching position at Stanford and Chairmanship of IFIP Working Group - 6.1 to join DARPA where he would manage the packet communication technologies, the Internet project and the network security program.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt; Cerf’s impact on networking would continue both through his own contributions and those of his many students, including Dalal, Carl Sunshine, Richard Karp, Jim Mathis, Ron Crane, Darryl Rubin, John Shoch and Judith Estrin, the daughter of Jerry Estrin, Cerf’s thesis advisor at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cerf at DARPA, Dalal decided to strike out on his own independent of Cerf. In the end, Metcalfe’s offer to create the successor protocol to Pup was simply too good to resist. After joining SDD in 1977, Dalal began assembling his team – including Will Crowther, once a critical member of BBN’s Arpanet team, and Hal Murray – and conducting an in-depth review of Pup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe also recruited James White, whom he had known from his Arpanet days and who was now working at Stanford Research Institute, to become Manager of the Communications Software Group in 1977.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; In addition to working on the rearchitecting of Pup, White’s Group assumed responsibility for commercializing a PARC developed, distributed-Ethernet-based electronic mail system called “Grapevine.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 1978, with Ethernet working and product sales no closer than when he had joined SDD, Metcalfe found himself frustrated and restless. Wanting to see his Ethernet technology commercialized before others exploited the opportunity, he argued that Xerox should sell Ethernet products unbundled from computer systems. However, management did not see it his way. In the spring of 1978, Metcalfe issued management an ultimatum, with the veiled threat that he would resign unless Ethernet be made available for sale. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I came back to Xerox in 1976, we were about two and a half years from product shipment and in 1978 we were about two and a half years from product shipment. And my analysis, at the time amateurish, was that there were things other than engineering that you needed to do right to succeed, and, apparently, since we were so good at engineering, the problems must be in marketing or manufacturing or something, and so I wanted to find out more about those, because I hated failing and we were – WE, not they, WE were failing. Since I was buried in an engineering organization, I gave Xerox seven months notice and said I want to at least report to a general manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe did not get his wish, and true to his word, left Xerox at the end of 1978 to become an independent consultant.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When joining Xerox’s Systems Development Division (SDD) in 1977 to lead the reengineering of the Pup communication protocol, Dalal, like most curious computer scientists, had some knowledge of the breadth of innovations underway within PARC and thus within SDD. However, scant facts woven together with rumor were no match for the actual experience of using a graphic-based Altos computer connected to other Altos/ minicomputers, and to peripherals (such as laser printers), using the high speed Ethernet local area network. Dalal quickly realized the Altos vision was not just another computer innovation, but foreshadowed a sea change about to revolutionize computing. He also knew those rearchitecting TCP had not contemplated a future populated with thousands, even millions, of networks. Dalal remembers his surprising revelation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It became clear to me after I had left Stanford to go to Xerox the impact that local area networks would have on internetworking, and that while the theoretical problems associated with internetworking had been solved in the DARPA context, new light was being shed on what personal computers might want of an internetworking protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Metcalfe had before him, Dalal tried to participate in both the proprietary, I-am-an-employee-and-am-restricted-in-what-I-can-say, world of Xerox and the academic-government social system driving the creation of TCP. He too found that he had neither the time nor willingness to deal with the conflicts of participating in both communities, and therefore focused on Pup. To that task he brought an extensive knowledge of TCP, knowledge to influence the redesign of Pup.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1977, the first draft specifications for Xerox’s next generation communication protocol had been created. To become known as Xerox Network System (XNS), it was designed for the new higher speed Ethernet and extended the datagram architecture in Pup to accommodate gateways, or routers, between networks. XNS separated the functions of routing a datagram (a Pup in Xerox’s lexicon) or internet packet through multiple networks from the functions of communicating end-to-end over a network, such as an Ethernet LAN. (In XNS, the network layer consisted of both an “internet sublayer” and “network-specific sublayer.”)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 6.2 XNS and Ethernet.) XNS, like Pup, supported multiple transport protocols, including a virtual circuit protocol as a network-specific-sublayer. This separation of the network and transport functions would ripple through all future networking protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 8.9.1 XNS and Ethernet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.9.1_XNS_and_Ethernet.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of XNS and Ethernet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A future of multiple heterogeneous networks, especially Ethernet networks that by design involved significant retransmissions, posed serious problems for TCP version 2.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1976, DARPA forwarded its newly specified TCP version 2 to MIT’s Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) hoping to gain their support for its use. Michael Dertouzos, head of LCS, assigned Dave Reed the responsibility of review and comment. Reed, with help from Dave Clark and others, wrote a memo to DARPA in November 1976, proposing an alternative to TCP they called Data Stream Protocol (DSP). Kahn had absolutely no interest in having one of DARPA’s primary research centers develop an orthogonal protocol to TCP and immediately convened a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahn remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dave Reed had come up with another protocol because he didn’t like TCP. I sat down with Dave and others from MIT, and they described the Data Stream Protocol, and I said: ‘But that’s what TCP is like, with one minor difference.’ And they said: ‘No, it isn’t. Read what Vint says in this report.’ And I said: ‘ That’s just the way he interpreted it. Go back to our original paper, and you’ll see you could interpret it your way too.’  So even that original paper that we wrote was subject to multiple interpretations about how you actually do the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahn, knowing he had to convince MIT to align behind TCP and abandon DSP, assured them an influential role if they dropped their DSP ideas. Reed and Clark began going to meetings and soon Clark - who was then working on both interconnecting LCS’s Multics computer to the Arpanet and developing their token-passing LAN, LCS Net - became a key participant in TCP activities.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; Clark remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we started going to the meetings and, in fact, although Dave [Reed] was the one who wrote the DSP memos, I was the one that got interested in the meetings and started going. And during the remainder of the decade, while a lot of local network was going on at MIT, I got more involved in the TCP activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long, Clark too saw the need to split network-to-network, or internet, functions from the end-to-end, or transport, functions within TCP. Dalal recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept of the datagram evolved out of some gentle hints that were coming out of John Shoch, David Boggs, and myself who were working now on Pup and XNS. Pup was then beginning to be disclosed, but even before Pup had been disclosed, we tried to convince Vint and Jon Postel and others of the importance of breaking things into a datagram [internet] and a session protocol [transport] – primarily because datagrams are useful in local area networking contexts. It was Vint and Dave Clark and Jon Postel that saw that immediately, and slowly started modifying TCP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Clark, Reed and Kenneth Pogran published an IEEE paper calling for the separation of LAN communication protocols into two-layers:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A two-layer structure is a very natural one for low-level protocols in a local area network. The bottom layer should provide the basic function of delivering an addressed message to its (one of many) destinations. This level corresponds to the concept of a datagram network… Above this first layer should be made available a variety of protocols. One protocol should support a virtual circuit mechanism, since a virtual circuit is definitely the appropriate model for a great deal of the communication that will go on in any network, local or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1978, it had become clear that TCP Version 2 had to be changed to accommodate all kinds of network interconnections and work to split it into two layers, network and transport, began.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 6.3 TCP to TCP/IP.) TCP/IP was first known as TCP Version 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-63-tcp-to-tcpip&quot;&gt;Exhibit 6.3 TCP to TCP/IP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.10.1_TCP_to_TCP_IP.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of TCP to TCP/IP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new network layer protocols, also to be known as internet protocols (from interconnected networks), enabled seamless interconnection of networks without impacting the internal operations of any network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt; Jon Postel describes the internet layer protocol or IP protocol:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In summary, the ARPA Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) supports delivery of datagrams from an internet source to a single internet destination. IP treats each datagram as an independent entity unrelated to any other datagram. There are not connections or logical circuits (virtual or otherwise). There are no acknowledgments either end-to-end or hop-to-hop. There is no error control for data, only a header checksum. There are no retransmissions. There is minimal flow control. For flexibility, it is explicitly left to higher level protocols to provide these functions.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gateways, specialized computers used to interconnect networks, routed traffic over the networks using the internet protocols&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;  (See Exhibit 6.3.1 TCP/IP Transmission Model.) The separation of the network functions from TCP then enabled the creation of different transport layer protocols including a reliable end-to-end service, such as virtual circuits (TCP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-631-tcpip-transmission-model&quot;&gt;Exhibit 6.3.1 TCP/IP Transmission Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.10.2_TCP_IP_Transmission_Model.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of TCP/IP Transmission Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1979, DARPA decided to emphasize the use of DEC’s new VAX series computers. Since DEC had already decided to use Etherent to interconnect their VAX computers and their peripherals, having TCP/IP operate over Etherent became essential. Only there was first the problem of what operating system to use. Kahn explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We came to the conclusion in 1979, with a lot of input from the community, I might add, that what we really ought to do was go with the VAX, since it was the only appropriate machine around. Unfortunately, they weren’t very happy with VMS or UNIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So DARPA awarded a contract to the University of California at Berkeley to take the UNIX system, put it on the VAX, and add all these other features, which Bill Joy did. DARPA awarded a contract to BBN to convert TCP/IP to UNIX. Joy was to then take the BBN port of TCP/IP and integrate it with the UNIX port to the VAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to separate the network and transport layers made so obvious by LANs also affected protocol development efforts in Europe. That story begins in 1975, when IFIP Working Group 6.1 switched its institutional affiliation to ISO.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1975 the European members of IFIP Working Group 6.1 reluctantly concluded that the Americans were committed to going down the path of TCP. More important, the strategy of the Europeans to influence the CCITT had failed: the CCITT was clearly going to make X.25, a virtual circuit protocol, and a PTT network standard. [50] An X.25 standard, however, left computer users without an end-to-end protocol. Frustrated, yet not without fight, they regrouped and approached the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to argue their case for end-to-end, or host-to-host, communication standards. ISO, the only international standards organization as powerful as CCITT, was organized as a series of technical committees with specialized sub-committees. Data processing and data communications standards rested with Technical Committee 97 (TC 97). Within TC 97, Subcommittee 6 (SC 6) was responsible for data communications standards and the logical home for the members of IFIP Working Group 6.1. Hubert Zimmerman, a senior member of the French delegation and IFIP, recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We approached Subcommittee 6, explained what we were doing and requested their requirements for going forward with a communication standard for host-to-host communications, or data processing oriented communications standards. There was a low level of acceptance of the message at that time. We were accepted as people, but the ideas did not really get through!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the lukewarm reception, the members of IFIP Working Group 6.1 began working with SC 6, only to find themselves once again embroiled in the politics of technology, not its merits. Again Zimmerman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We worked with Subcommittee 6 on the definition of the HDLC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt; That was the time when HDLC was just getting out of the oven after ten years of hard work. Now, there was a fair amount of politics in this, and HDLC had been blocked for some time. Until IBM got SDLC through, HDLC couldn’t get through. There was a lot of politics, and we were probably not good enough politicians at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Europeans, who hoped TC 97 SC 6 would create end-to-end communication protocol standards, another barrier emerged to test their resolve. Most of them felt they had little choice but to cooperate and push for passage of HDLC, while simultaneously urging SC 6 to take on the challenge of end-to-end protocols. Not all Europeans were prepared to be so compliant however. Acting independently, the British began lobbying TC 97 members to organize a full subcommittee on end-to-end, or as they would become known, “higher-layer” protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the question of higher-layer protocols scheduled for vote at the upcoming March 1977 SC 6 meeting in Melbourne, Australia, a resolution seemed likely. Unfortunately, the plenary of SC 6 – the decision making body within all ISO committees – rejected the idea, concluding that higher-layer protocols were “not mature enough.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt; Then, a week later, in a stunning reversal, the parent organization, TC 97, decided over the opposition of the U.S. delegation that the higher-layer protocols were sufficiently mature to begin standardization, and authorized the organization of Subcommittee 16 (SC 16) on Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) – a subcommittee equal in status to SC 6. The politics of deciding technological outcomes had birthed a new institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first task of organizing a new subcommittee required appointing a member organization to be secretariat, and then for the selected secretariat to appoint a chairman. (The secretariat handles all subcommittee administrative responsibilities.)  A struggle to be secretariat set the British against the U.S. delegations, with the U.S. delegation winning despite having originally opposed the idea of creating the new subcommittee. (The winning argument was that the U.S. held too few ISO secretariats.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American National Standards Institute Committee on Computers and Information Processing (ANSI/X3) represented the U.S. in ISO and thus became secretariat. The Systems Planning and Resources Committee (SPARC) of ANSI/X3 authorized a study group, under the initial leadership of Jerry Foley of Burroughs, to form the delegation to SC 16 and create the initial U.S. position paper. Foley in turn recruited Charles, “Charley,” Bachman of Honeywell to the committee despite his having no prior experience with communication protocols. Bachman, who had just completed chairing ANSI/X3/SPARC/DBMS, a study group chartered to investigate the potential for standardization in the area of database management systems (DBMS), had proved his commitment to standards and Foley believed the committee would benefit from his leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once constituted, the study group had to convince American computer companies to cooperate and create voluntary standards. While opinion divided as to whether standards helped or hurt the economic fortunes of any given U.S. computer company, most executives thought creating standards was a tactic to give foreign companies an opportunity to drive a wedge into the dominant market share held by U. S. companies. As Bachman recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IBM and Burroughs weren’t sure they wanted standards. Honeywell wasn’t sure they wanted standards, except that I said: ‘You do want standards.’ When the issue of participation came up, I said: ‘We should participate.’ They said: ‘No, we’re not sure we want something which is a worldwide standard,’ because they were more concerned about losing sales than getting sales out of it. In fact, the way I got Honeywell involved is that I volunteered to be chairman of the committee. IBM said it was inappropriate to have me as chairman of this group because the chairman should be neutral, sit there, and administer the thing and should not be a protagonist for anything. I was an aggressive chairman!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bachman, drawing on his DBMS experience, believed standards should focus on interfaces, where components of systems meet. His philosophy is captured in an excerpt from the Summary of the ANSI/X3/SPARC DBMS Framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the course of the early discussions of the Study Group, it emerged that what any standardization should treat is interfaces. There is potential disaster and little merit in developing standards that specify how components are to work. What is proper for standards specification is how the components are meshed; in other words, the specification of interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman, who would become a key member of SC 16, felt resigned to the inevitability of virtual-circuit public data networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt; Yet rather than demoralizing him, it became a source of motivation. Cerf remembers “Zim’s” state of mind before SC 16 ever met:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can remember walking down the street in Geneva with Zimmerman in 1977, and he was telling me he was going to start out with virtual circuit oriented stuff because it was the only thing that he could sell in the architecture. He knew, personally I don’t know if he publicly admitted it, but I think he knew, and said so privately, that he wanted to introduce the datagram notions, but it would be later, after everybody was comfortable with the architectural model based on virtual circuits. He was much more politically astute than I was at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bachman and Zimmerman would need all the political savvy they could muster for SC 16 would become not only the venue for waging battle over higher-layer protocol standards but a principal coordinating body forging cooperation between ISO and CCITT. To their advantage, the 40-to-50 engineers and scientists who had trekked from INWG through IFIP to ISO constituted much of the membership of the participating country delegations, and had coalesced into a consensus group holding broad agreement on standards-making.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt; Testing their resolve would be the presence of invited representatives from CCITT and ECMA – organizations whose members’ economic interests cast shadows over every SC 16 decision and action. (See Exhibit 6.5 SC 16 Organization Structure)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SC 16 first convened in Washington D.C. in March 1978. After concluding the necessary organizational issues, each country presented position papers: every one called for a multi-layer protocol architecture. Given the unanimous agreement, they next established four working groups to distribute the work of creating standards. (See Table 6.0 SC 16 Initial Working Groups) With much accomplished, Bachman suggested they call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-8121-iso-tc97sc-16-organization-structure&quot;&gt;Exhibit 8.12.1 ISO TC97/SC 16 Organization Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_8.12.1_ISO_TC97_SC16.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of ISO TC97/SC16 structure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Zimmerman, harden by years of talk and slow action, sought more. He wanted members to commit their agreements to paper and sign the document before the meeting adjourned. Bachman, while thinking the exercise “premature,” said if it could be created then OK. Zimmerman remembers their late night effort:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We remained there in the evening with a few guys, and we started to cut and paste and write down the things. It was probably a twelve-page document in which you had all the basic ingredients of the final version of the Reference Model. We picked seven layers – in some cases some people had organized their stuff in five and six and seven – I think it was the U.S. contribution that put the composition into seven layers. We picked this one because it was not worse than the others, and the others would fit also within this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coming-into-being of the OSI Reference Model (Reference Model) benefited from all the knowledge amassed creating computer communication protocols since NCP of Arpanet.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt; In segmenting computer communications into logical layers, end-to-end protocols could be assembled by selecting appropriate protocols from each layer to reflect network diversity, while sharing as many intermediate protocols as possible to reduce protocol complexity. Sharing of protocols also meant development and testing could be greatly reduced. (See Exhibit 6.6 The OSI Reference Model) The Reference Model recognized distinct transport and network layers, with SC 16 becoming responsible for the top four layers, the higher-layers, and SC 6 retaining responsibility for the three lower-layers. Hence, the critical coordination between the transport and network layers rested in two committees, a structural separation that would cause future problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;table-8122-sc-16-initial-working-groups&quot;&gt;Table 8.12.2 SC 16 Initial Working Groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chairman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country of Chair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WG 1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Overall Architecture&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hubert Zimmerman&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WG 2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Layers up through Transport&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;George White&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;U.

It was not a technical standard itself. Done for reasons similar to those that had motivated the speedy adoption of the X.25 standard by the CCITT, the Reference Model was seen as a way to direct market actions and head-off proprietary vendor – or CCITT – standards. For it was the power of the CCITT to dictate the communication protocols computers used (over the public data networks) that posed the most serious threat to the interests of the members of SC 16. In creating the X.25 virtual circuit protocol, and formulating a standard for teletext, an end user application, the CCITT seemed well on the way to locking in how higher-layer applications interfaced to the PTT networks and thus dictating forever how computers interconnected over networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1978, SC 16 met in Paris to resolve requested changes to the Reference Model and finalize a second version. As with the first meeting, key members pulled a near all-nighter to finish the revised document. John Day, a participant in Arpanet Network Working Group (NWG), INWG, and IFIP meetings, was invited by Zimmerman to help formalize the Reference Model for SC 16. Day remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Standards people met from 9:00 to 4:00 and took their leisurely time, and talked the issues; it was an old-boys club, but at those times, while the standards were important, they didn’t have the economic impact, potential economic impact, that this was going to have. So the rules had changed substantially. There was big money involved, and everybody knew it. That’s where the ‘electro-political engineering’ term comes from. Everybody realized that where we drew the lines for the layers, and how we did the technical solutions, determined market lines, determined economics, determined money in somebody’s pocket. It was no longer this nice old-boys club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-8123-the-osi-reference-model&quot;&gt;Exhibit 8.12.3 The OSI Reference Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Selects appropriate service for application&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Provides code conversion, data reformatting&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Session&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Coordinates interaction between application processes&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Transport&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Provides for end-to-end data integrity and quality of service&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Network&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Switches and routes information&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Transfers unit of information to other end of physical link&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Physical&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Transmits bitstream to medium&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1979, less than eighteen months after being formed, SC 16 transmitted the Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnection to its parent organization TC 97 as a Working Draft. TC 97 speedily approved the Reference Model Working Draft before yearend 1979. Then SC 16 began incorporating suggested changes before resubmitting the Reference Model to TC 97 as a Draft Proposal (DP). TC 97 would then have to approve the Reference Model DP, before sending it to the ISO as a Draft International Standards (DIS). In an auspicious act of cooperation, the CCITT Rapporteur’s Group on Public Data Network Services joined in recognizing the Reference Model.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt; With institutions and markets racing to decide the future, communication protocols had become an important.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Whereas computer communications over the public telephone networks preoccupied the Europeans, the American standards making body, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), focused on the emerging technology of private local area networks. This was not the result of some bureaucratic deliberation but the initiative of largely one man: Robert Rosenthal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the NBS installed their Arpanet TIP in late 1971, Rosenthal was assigned the responsibility for building instrumentation to measure network performance: not of the network itself, which was being done by the NMC at UCLA, but performance from the perspective of the user. NBS wanted to understand the value of networking in order to recommend its use to other agencies, a responsibility consistent with the NBS charter of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;developing federal information processing standards, assisting other agencies deploy technologies that support those standards and conducting appropriate research to assure federal agencies remain on the leading edge in the use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1976, Rosenthal, familiar with the work going on at PARC, began thinking of how he might build local area networks suitable for use in the Federal government.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt; With full support from his superior Dr. Ira Cotton (who, as Rosenthal fondly remembers, said: “Here’s some rope, go hang yourself!”), Rosenthal contacted Metcalfe, Boggs and Shoch at PARC as well as others knowledgeable of networking, such as Charlie Bass then at Zilog. Rosenthal remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our concept was to take really dumb terminals, give them to employees all over the Bureau of Standards, and let them access the few very large hosts that we had available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1978, three working prototype boards had been built and a Request for Proposal (RFP) to build production quantities was let and won by a small company in Florida. In late-1978, as the network boards began being received from the vendor and installed, NBS-Net came into being. Rosenthal comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we implemented a network based loosely on the technology of Ethernet. It had the unique attribute of having a single power supply, fanning out to up to eight RS-232 connectors, which at the time was completely different from the Xerox approach of building an Alto like workstation supported by a local network technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got so excited about all of this that I thought it would be a good idea to put a workshop together. So I called everybody I knew in local area networking. MITRE was one of the first calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MITRE, of Bedford, MA, a government contractor for primarily the Air Force, had installed its Arpanet TIP at the same time as NBS, at the end of 1971. Concurrently, MITRE received one of two contracts let by the Air Force to develop local area networking prototypes and conduct networking studies. The other contract went to Ford Aerospace, of Sunnyvale, CA. By year-end 1972, Ash Dohad of MITRE had working a slotted broadband network named MITRE-Net. MITRE-Net used radio frequency (RF) technology over a cable to create many side-by-side communication channels much like frequency division multiplexing. Broadband differed radically from Ethernet and token ring in that it multiplexed many channels onto the transmission media. Ethernet and token ring created just one communication channel over the coaxial cable or twisted-pair wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 1976, Greg Hopkins engineered changes to MITRE-Net so one or more channels could service Ethernet-type traffic. Although the performance of the Ethernet-like channels was not impressive - three hundred thousand bits per second - MITRE did secure a patent for its contribution. (Their work cites the prior work of Abramson and Metcalfe.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late-1978, the Air Force requested MITRE investigate the issues of local networking and recommend actions they, the Air Force, should take. The timing proved propitious, for shortly thereafter came the call from Rosenthal suggesting they hold a workshop. It did not take long to agree to convene a forum on “Local Network Protocols” to be held January 31, 1979 in Columbia, MD. In their subsequent calls to other possible participants, it became very clear that while virtually everyone who had come into contact with local area networking sensed its importance, they all expressed confusion over what it all meant or what to do about it. Perfect fodder for a forum.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

We also did some work for some people downtown. So we were very much aware of what Xerox was up to. Xerox’s mindset, as I recall, at the time, was not to unbundle the LAN technology, but to sell an office system. Our motivation was to unbundle that technology and provide the equivalent of a carrier, but local area networks. At the time – we were forcing definitions like ‘locally owned and administered.’ All the bad things that we knew about carriers, from a user’s perspective – they’re not bad; the regulatory kinds of things – we wanted to do without, because we were trying to connect terminal devices within buildings we owned. There was no need for carrier services, so we administered them ourselves, we did everything ourselves. That’s what we meant by local networks at the time.”</p>"

First came the need to change design choices built into Arpanet and to ready it for interconnection with a packet radio network. To do so meant both redesigning NCP, which provided neither end-to-end virtual circuits nor true datagram connectivity, and accommodating gateways between networks. Cerf and Kahn put forth a first effort in 1974 with their Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Europeans were not to be left behind. The CYCLADES network demonstrated that end-to-end virtual circuits could be fit with pure datagram message delivery. The organization of INWG and its transformation into IFIP WG 6.1 provided a forum where the myriad approaches to computer communications were debated. The presentation of TCP precipitated a flurry of design alternatives and the eventual parting of the two sides of the Atlantic and their desires for an overarching network architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the proliferation of computers in the United States motivated engineers to solve the problems of fast inter-computer communications, not over telephone circuits but over coaxial cables or twisted pair wires. First Farber birthed token ring and then Metcalfe fused the ideas of Arpanet and ALOHAnet into Ethernet. These local area networks required communication software different than TCP or even TCP version 2. XNS helped drive a new design of TCP, one that would become TCP/IP – where the end-to-end transport functionality would be divorced from network connectivity. This layered approached became a standard with the OSI Reference Model in 1979. Yet all of this activity left users swimming in confusion, prompting the NBS and MITRE to call for a workshop in early 1979 to make sense of it all. All too soon entrepreneurs would charge forward to seize the perceived opportunities in local area networking and, in the process, dislodge governments and their institutions from the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/9.0/Overview/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In early 1979, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and MITRE held two workshops that then led to the Local Area Communications Network Symposium (LACN Symposium) in May. This marked a watershed for local area networking. Before the LACN Symposium, doubt and uncertainty characterized the future of local area networking. Afterwards, entrepreneurs and corporations rushed to form companies and began engineering products for market. Being first mattered, even if no one was sure what technologies were best or what products customers wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Metcalfe faced the biggest challenge. He first had to free Ethernet from the proprietary grasp of Xerox. With his help, DEC, Intel and Xerox announced their intention to make Ethernet a public standard. Metcalfe next had to transform his one-person consulting firm, 3Com, into a firm selling Ethernet products. Setting Metcalfe apart from coming competitors was his unswerving vision of local computer networking; a vision strongly rooted in his Xerox PARC experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Pliner of Ford Aerospace, a government contractor, knew enough about local area networking to send a team of his to present a paper at the LACN Symposium. The core of Pliner’s staff joined him to start Sytek, a month after Metcalfe started 3Com. Pliner and Metcalfe had even talked of doing something together. Sytek too began as a consulting firm. Then in 1981, Sytek introduced a low cost broadband local area network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralph Ungermann knew Metcalfe and Pliner, mostly through the efforts of Charlie Bass. After failing to find a way to work with either, Ungermann and Bass incorporated Ungermann-Bass (UB) the same month as Sytek. UB was first to market with an unbundled Ethernet product. UB’s vision was much more pragmatic than Metcalfe’s: they wanted to build a successful company selling products customers would buy. This brought them into direct competition with data communication firms, like Micom and Codex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micom and Codex had listened to their customers wanting to interconnect their growing numbers of terminals and computers. They did so not with a vision of a future when users would have computers, not terminals, on their desktops, but because customers had problems interconnecting terminals to computers. Their solutions were not LANs but dataPBXs. For Micom, the natural step of selling a dataPBX accelerated their fast growing business and helped propel them into becoming a public company. With the never-ending issues attendant to growing rapidly, the gnawing problems of their dataPBX were easy to ignore. Codex seemed nonchalant and distracted. Neither could for long, however, for the LAN start-ups had momentum, access to readily available venture capital and entrepreneurial leaders bent on building big companies. The starting of something new and important was happening: it would become the second wave of computer communications, known as: Networking.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/9.1/The-NBS-and-MITRE-Workshop-of-January-1979/",

After designing a number of I/O and data acquisition products, Severino remembers the rush project in 1974:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Prime had a problem. Someone had sold a system that had to have two computers that talked to each other. So what happened was they threw this specification to me and said: ‘OK, we need this done. You know, we’re late. The customer wants this. We don’t have anything to give him. You’ve got to do this project.’ I looked at the spec and it was just a 16 bit parallel interface between two computers. It was clearly done for the computer room. Just interconnect two computers. And I looked at it and I said: ‘Well, why don’t we make this so that it extends a little bit and we’ll make sort of a daisy-chain and we’ll make an eight computer interconnect. I got two computers working and then I jumped on to another project. We shipped it. It was fine. There was no real need to do anything more than two at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, William (Bill) Poduska, Vice President of Engineering, instinctively understood the importance of interconnecting computers. Before joining Prime, Poduska had been a professor at MIT involved with Project MAC and familiar with Arpanet. This early exposure to timesharing and computer communications informed his design decisions and proved instrumental in Prime’s eventual success. In late 1974, Poduska gave William Farr, who had also joined Prime in 1972 from Honeywell, some reading material. Farr remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bill gave me some papers to read to try to generate some ideas, seed my thinking. There were papers by Kleinrock, Abramson, and Kahn and Metcalfe’s PhD thesis. I did a little more literature search and came up with some papers from Bell Labs on SpiderNet, and got really excited about the idea of actually linking computers together in a way that went beyond just serial, RS-232, kinds of communications. We had thought about linking computers with some high-speed parallel cable networks, where there was basically a master and slave. That was very limited, in that, in order to achieve any kind of performance, you had to have a lot of parallelism in terms of the data and fairly high clock rates and expensive cables. The machines also had to be close to each other. Paul Severino had created the Inter-Processor Communication Controller (IPC) that we were selling. At the same time, I was working on these ideas that had developed from the ALOHAnet papers, Metcalfe’s Ethernet papers and the token ring papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farr analyzed the alternative networking schemes and made several presentations to the engineering staff. Concluding in favor of token ring, he wrote an initial product specification. Farr remembers a discussion he had with Poduska in early 1976:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He wanted me to have a network to run at the Spring Joint Computer Conference (SJCC) to be held in June 1976. We had a heated discussion about whether that was a possible or a reasonable thing to do. It could have been done as a basic prototype with little or no software because at that time at Prime things got done that way. You just did it. But since I’m very product oriented, my goal was to get something that would be a robust product, not something that was a prototype. My reasoning at the time was, if we develop this prototype, it would be interesting for the show, but then we’d basically have to go back and start over again and really do something real in order to have a shippable product. Anyway, it didn’t get shown at the SJCC and, as a matter of fact, it took about a year from that point to actually have working hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poduska challenged Farr not because he wanted to ship an inferior product, but because he knew, or least sensed, the importance of this project for Prime. Farr remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bill Poduska is one of the most creative people I’ve ever met. He was able to take an idea and push it way beyond what other people were thinking about, and see the value in very practical terms at the same time. He was always pushing. There was never a time when he was satisfied with anything. He would be satisfied with what you had done, but he always realized you could do more if you really wanted to. So there was this constant technological tension that he maintained, but it was a very fatherly type, fostering type. I also worked at DEC in 1961-62 and Ken Olsen was very much the same type of person. As a matter of fact, Ken came around every day and talked to every engineer when I was there. Gordon Bell also was – not quite as social, but very much the same kind of fostering person; very dynamic, generated lots of ideas and encouraged you to pick up on them and continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the 1976 SJCC, Severino resigned to join another start-up, Prime having grown too big, and the allure of a start-up, this time in the data acquisition business, was too compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Farr, Prime remained a very exciting environment. In early 1977, however, his enthusiasm, encountered the resistance of others who did not believe, as he did, in the promise of networking. So despite rumors that DEC, Hewlett Packard and Data General had networking projects under development, he had an all too common experience for those working on leading edge technology. Farr remembers trying to gain the support needed to build a local area network:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had a boss at that time, Charlie Smith, who said: ‘Bill’s [Poduska] been right often in the past. Maybe I should listen and support this project.’  We went to our marketing organization and they saw absolutely zero need for this product. They thought it was a silly idea. I think the basic reason for that was that nobody else had a network, so how could they sell something that they had no competition for. I said: ‘Can’t you see that this is something that is valuable because people can share information at high speeds?’ They said; ‘Well people don’t need to do that. Nobody’s doing that now, so it’s clearly not important.’ It was very frustrating because until we could get this targeted as a product, we couldn’t get real support to build a large network which was needed to really prove the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be deterred, Farr convinced Smith to buy enough equipment to build a network to interconnect sixteen computers in the engineering organization. Farr, Bob Gordon and Paul Levine then built a token ring network they called RingNet. By mid-1978, engineering had become totally dependent on RingNet, both for electronic mail and file sharing. In January 1979, Prime announced RingNet as a product.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

There were higher level issues that were more important, and a lot of those issues had to do with the upper layer protocol suite. At that time we were more concerned with the access mechanisms in local area networks, and we grew to appreciate, because the experts that we had brought together had the ARPA experience, the requirement and the necessity for inter working these LAN’s, using higher level protocols: XNS, TCP, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I started working towards a larger conference as soon as the forum was finished because there was a clear message that something important was happening! So we knew there was a real need to start the talk about local networks, and we decided to call them local area networks, by the way. I remember Bob Metcalfe always wanted to call them ‘local computer networks,’ LACNs, and I wasn’t particularly fond of that because of this mindset I had of unbundling this technology, and I always wanted to call them local area networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preference for “local area networks” over “local computer networks” represented a real difference in perspective between those within NBS and MITRE and Metcalfe the visionary. Both NBS and MITRE saw this new technology as a solution to connecting terminals to multiple host computers, particularly to solve the problems and to reduce the costs of stringing computer cable from every terminal to every computer. With a local area network, one cable could traverse an entire facility with all terminals and computers connected to the one “local” cable. While a valid and understandable objective, for someone like Metcalfe, who had seen the future in the form of Altos workstations and believed a computer would soon be on every desktop, the expression “local computer network” better captured the technology’s role. Metcalfe’s views were not completely disregarded for he won the debates concerning the priority of higher level protocols – convinced as he was that the lower level access issues had been solved with Ethernet. To keep the momentum going, NBS and MITRE scheduled a more extensive Forum for March 7 at the Copley Plaza Hotel, Boston, MA.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/9.4/Robert-Metcalfe-and-the-MIT-Laboratory-of-Computer-Science/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe soon found his first consulting client, Michael Dertouzos, of MIT’s Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS). Dertouzos faced some local area networking decisions in as complex a computer environment as existed at the time. As a result of a university gift program begun in 1978 by Xerox, LCS (along with computer science laboratories at Carnegie-Mellon and Stanford) received Altos workstations, file servers and the experimental 3 Megabit per second Ethernet. That meant that LCS had two networks, Ethernet and token ring, with another network, Chaosnet, at the nearby AI Labs. DARPA, keenly interested in the comparative advantages of the different networks, awarded LCS a contract to conduct performance measurements. In addition, DEC proposed to give LCS twenty to thirty DEC VAX 11/750 minicomputers if used as single user workstations. To make the VAX’s effective, however, required interconnecting and integrating them into their existing computer facilities. The most obvious, but not necessarily the best, decision seemed to be to reengineer a faster, second-generation token ring; a technology unencumbered by the complications of Xerox’s uncertain commercialization policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe helped Dertouzos, not as an engineer, but by evaluating management practices and recommending changes. He would advocate that LCS agree to DEC’s terms and commit to a vision of desktop computing, even if it meant interconnecting the VAX’s with token ring and not Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interconnecting the VAX’s with token ring required upgrading the performance of their existing 1 Megabit LNI’s. To do so meant finding outside help, for Dertouzos knew LCS did not have the requisite skills to do the re-engineering in-house. For help, Dertouzos thought of Howard Salwen, a former classmate, who had a small company that engineered communication products principally for government contracts. Dave Clark recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mike knew that Howard’s company was very involved in communications and, in particular, that Howard was very strong in the analog engineering skill, and he knew that the crucial aspect of getting this ring to work right was to have somebody who is not just a digital engineer. Mike was very anxious to make sure that we succeeded by finding somebody who would match our skills. He basically said: ‘I know Howard. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a good guy. He run’s this consulting company. We’ll give him a contract for $100,000 to do a Version 2 LNI for the Unibus.’ And so we wrote him a contract. We didn’t do any competitive selection or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salwen and a partner had founded Proteon Associates (Proteon) in 1972. In 1974, health problems forced his first partner to resign and Al Marshall became Salwen’s new partner. Proteon’s competence rested largely in designing and building modems under a number of government agency contracts. Salwen remembers his early involvement with MIT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There were meetings at MIT that were attended by Metcalfe, who at that time was consulting to LCS. The meetings were to discuss a philosophy that would be adopted by the whole group for networking. Of course, Metcalfe was strongly in favor of Ethernet. There was a group from the Artificial Intelligence Lab arguing in favor of their Chaosnet design. Dave Clark and Jerry Saltzer were in favor of token passing ring. I came in as a consultant with Al and started attending these meetings. And the meetings were very exciting. There was a lot of screaming and yelling in those meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe’s consulting to a university, especially one favored by Xerox, may have raised eyebrows at Xerox, but the possibility of his working for a competitor raised fearful concerns. Those prone to yell fire at the first sign of smoke must have ranted “I told you so” after reading Metcalfe’s newsletter promoting his availability and expertise, and advocating the coming of networking and the superiority of Ethernet. Given Xerox’s proprietary attitude regarding their technology, it would seem a challenge only a masochist would have undertaken. But Metcalfe had two advantages: his own unrelenting drive to materialize his vision, and an ally and friend in David Liddle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Liddle recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bob wanted to somehow stimulate things happening out there. That was OK with me provided Xerox got something out of it. I didn’t want him to just go do it to make a big, blooming consulting business and have Xerox not benefit from it. So he sort of wanted to be the marriage broker of getting Xerox to open up the product to lots of other customers, lots of other companies. My position was: ‘No, but a few selected companies that could make really strong partners so we can make people see this as a de facto standard, then that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","next" : "/section/9.5/Robert-Metcalfe-and-Digital-Equipment-Corporation/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;While consulting to LCS, Metcalfe contacted Sam Fuller and Bill Johnson at DEC and was retained to work on their ten-year long-range plan (especially in the area of connectivity). Immediately he met with Gordon Bell, Vice President of Engineering at DEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell, like Poduska at Prime, had experience with Arpanet, including attending some Network Working Group meetings. He took it as a given that computer connectivity was important to DEC. Only he differed with those who had architected Arpanet. Bell explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The place I disagreed with ARPA was whether hosts could or couldn’t be IMPs. All the DEC work was based on the notion that a host could be an IMP. We were building IMP-sized computers, so I didn’t care whether you actually computed or did switching and computing. Everybody said: ‘No, you can’t ever have switching and computing in the same box.’ ‘We’re not going to force our users to have a whole switching network of IMPs around. This is crazy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell’s first efforts to launch DEC into communications began modestly. In early 1974, he decided to try using a PDP-11 as a new remote job entry station for their DEC System 10. He assembled a three-person team, one engineer each from the PDP-11 and DEC 10 engineering groups and Stu Wecker, his communication expert. Wecker had joined DEC in June 1972 as a researcher and had interconnected three minicomputers. Known as SHARP, for Stu’s Homogenous Asynchronous Re locatable Process operating system, the demo so impressed Bell that when he needed a communications expert, he turned to Wecker; despite the fact that before joining DEC, Wecker had absolutely zero experience in computer communications: “I didn’t even know the word ‘protocol.’” In seven weeks the team designed a new communications protocol: DDCMP, Digital Data Communications Message Protocol. DDCMP separated control of the devices at the end of the communications line from control of the communications line itself; a division between the “host-to-host” and network responsibilities and thus a two-layered protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the beginning of 1975, customer demand replaced management vision as the driving force motivating DEC to interconnect their computers. At first the need came from industrial and laboratory customers, requests that Bell forwarded to Wecker, their “guru on networking.” Wecker began talking to customers and soon headed up a small networking committee to determine the specifications for DEC’s computer communications network, to become known as DECNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing little about networking, Wecker studied material on the Arpanet. Of all the papers and articles he read, two proved essential to DECNET: Bob Metcalfe’s PHD Thesis and “Communication Networks for Computers” by Donald Davies and Derek Barber. The Davies and Barber book provided the concepts of layering, symmetry, and peer-to-peer networking (a key differentiation from IBM’s SNA). The writings of Louis Pouzin, Hubert Zimmerman, Vint Cerf, and Carl Sunshine also influenced his thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECNET shipped in late 1976, but, due to lack of functionality, such as terminal protocols, customers reacted poorly. Members of top management worried that maybe networks were just too complicated, and that DEC should concentrate on minicomputers. But Bell, committed to the importance of the VAX computer project launched in 1975, would have none of it, convinced that communications were essential to computers and that to achieve the VAX goal of a single architecture spanning the entire spectrum of performance would require multi-processor communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Bell had maintained his contacts with academia. When Metcalfe and Boggs submitted their paper to the ACM in May 1975, Bell was selected as one of the reviewers. Sensing its implications for DEC, he circulated the paper within DEC, nearly a year before its publication in July 1976, and initiated a number of low level networking developments. He no longer questioned whether networking would play a role in DEC’s future, he just wasn’t certain how or when. Customer demand, meanwhile, kept growing for computer communications, and DEC delivered DECNET Phase II in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell completed documenting his vision of DEC’s product strategy in 1978. Known as the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), it was approved by the DEC Board of Directors in December 1978. (Subsequent evolution is shown in [ ] brackets.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a set of homogeneous, distributed-computer-system products based on VAX-11 so a user can interface, store information and compute without re-programming or extra work from the following computer’s system sizes and styles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;via [a cluster of] large, central (mainframe) computers or network;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;at a local, shared departmental/group/team (mini) computer, [and evolving to a minicomputer with shared network servers];&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;as a single user personal (micro) computer within a terminal [and evolving to PC Clusters];&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;with interfacing to other manufacturer and industry standard information processing systems; andall interconnected via the local area Network Interconnect, (NI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;[i.e. Ethernet] in a single area, and the ability of interconnecting theLocal Area Networks (LANs) to Campus Area and Wide Area Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Bell warmly welcomed Metcalfe’s involvement with DEC in 1979; especially as none of the experimental projects he had launched after reading Metcalfe’s ACM paper seemed likely to result in the Network Interconnect needed for the DCE. Bell recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what the hell I was going to do. We didn’t have any good physical things. I didn’t want to go off and make them. We were in the throes of deciding between…There was the ring crowd. The ring looked good to me, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell was familiar with token ring and knew that Prime and a start-up of ex-Prime employees, Apollo, were both committed to using token ring. Furthermore, Saltzer and Clark had told DEC that they intended to interconnect the gifted VAXs with their version of token ring. Even so, Bell knew of no large operational token ring networks, whereas Xerox operated a large Ethernet network. But how could he loosen Xerox’s ironclad control over their technology? Bell again:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had to have it, and we would have invented our own. We had two or three different schemes, and I was just turning to that problem when Bob walks in the door and says: ‘Would you be interested in a collaborative effort with Xerox?’ A meeting was held with Metcalfe in a corner room in Parker Street. Parker Street was a prison-like building, a big concrete building. They had been meeting all day when I came into the meeting and said: ‘OK, where are you guys on this thing?’ They said something like: ‘Well, we’d really like to do something, but it isn’t clear..’ I said: ‘ How do we get this thing going?’ They said: ‘Well, you’d better write a letter to so and so.’ I said: ‘This thing isn’t moving fast enough. Tell me what the letter should say, and furthermore, we will write the letter right now.’ So I went next door to a word processing system, and Metcalfe and I composed a letter right then. I wrote: We want to do some kind of a joint venture to get a local area network that would be public, a network that would be used by both companies. I viewed Metcalfe as the behind-the-scenes oiler, greaser that made all of this happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter was sent to Liddle, George Pagent and James Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Metcalfe had begun consulting to IBM. He learned that they leaned towards token ring but had not made any final decisions as to the importance of local area networking or whether to introduce product.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Ralph Ungermann, one of the two founders of Zilog, recruited Bass from the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley to run the software group, which, along with the hardware and semiconductor groups, reported directly to him. Bass in turn hired John Davidson from BBN, his buddy from the ALOHAnet days, and Joe Kennedy. In 1976, Bass hired Judith Estrin, a graduate of Stanford well grounded in TCP, having worked with Cerf, and very familiar with Ethernet. Even with this considerable talent, however, the impetus to start an internal networking project came from a very unexpected source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Hunt felt very lucky when Kennedy hired him in May 1977. Only a year earlier, he had been a programmer at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), when, in one of those casual conversations that leads to the unexpected, Hunt remembers Joe Wells, the Director of the Stanford Center for Information Processing, asking him:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Bruce, do you know how much it costs to connect a terminal to our computer system?’ that was an IBM 370 system at the time. I said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘About $3,000,’ and I thought that was astonishing, since a terminal cost $2,000. So I started to really think about how one might deal with the issue. The thing that was interesting was that in the July 1976 issue of the ACM, there appeared Bob Metcalfe’s famous Ethernet paper, which I read, and went: ‘Wow, that’s really amazing!’ So I started thinking about that, and just about that time, Bernard Puteau, who was working on the Z-8000 microprocessor at Zilog, brought by a copy of the first Zilog SIO specification sheet. I looked at that and said: ‘You put these things together and you could actually create a network’ I then spent a huge number of evenings just sitting down and thinking about the issues. Thinking about how you could construct the hardware and so on. I essentially came up with the basic scheme of how it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In landing a job with Zilog, Hunt had the opportunity to see if his ideas would work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I went down to Zilog and literally built what was called Ariel over that summer with a guy named Ben Laws. Ben had come from Xerox PARC. Ben was a super guy to work with. I explained to him what I was up to and he said: ‘Oh yeah, there are some great chips that we could use.’ So we sat down and he did the hardware and looked at my simple designs and turned them into something that would work, and then we built the stuff. I did all the basic software that made it all work. We had the thing up by the end of the summer. In fact, as I recall, I started spending about 60% of my time doing nothing but giving demos of how the system would work, because it really ran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt’s Ariel project then got sucked up into the energy and chaos of Zilog with “some very heated discussions” of Ariel and its implications. Ungermann recalls: “We had some yelling and screaming matches where I was convinced that we had to have a low-cost, semiconductor-based interconnect strategy.” And an interconnect strategy was only one of many projects, underway or proposed. As Ungermann remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were a company that was encouraged by our parent to go in as many directions as possible, because we were the most prolific producers of products. So they were constantly saying: ‘Can’t you do this? Can’t you do that?’ So as a company, we went in ten different directions. We had stuff sprouting out all over the place! I can remember we had a board meeting and we walked Exxon around once to see the technology that we had going. I remember coming back to my office and thinking: ‘My God, unbelievable! It was unbelievable.’ We had everything in the world. We had very, very good people, and we did lots of things, but we didn’t make lots of money. My sense of Xerox PARC was that there was some kind of overall systems design which they were working towards. That may be oversimplifying it, but my sense of it was that Zilog had as much talent and as much energy, but it was more dispersed and it didn’t have any mission or objective or unifying force to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristic of the Zilog culture were the frequent parties held by Estrin and her roommate, Barbara Koalkin, who worked at PARC. These parties facilitated a cross-pollination of the PARC/Zilog cultures and activities. Invariably, small groups huddled intensely for hours discussing new technologies just becoming available or even still just thoughts. Hunt remembers one party:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the people Judy had invited to one of her parties was Fouad Tobaji. Fouad had just accepted the job at Stanford as assistant professor of electrical engineering. Judy introduced us and said: ‘Fouad, you ought to know Bruce. Bruce has built this little network’ and Fouad says; ‘Wow, you know, I studied networks. That’s what I did for my PhD for Leonard Kleinrock. You ought to go look at my papers.’ So I did. I went and read all of his papers and his Ph.D. thesis and he had proposed a way to analyze networks. This was similar to Metcalfe but Metcalfe didn’t have the basic mathematical sophistication to carry it through. Well, Fouad had and he carried it through for the carrier sense multiple access scheme. In fact, he wrote four very famous papers. Well, when I read his papers, I said: ‘Gee, I can extend this to the collision detection case.’ So I did the derivations and added the extension of being able to handle collision detection and I took it to Fouad. Literally, I think I did it in about 12 days. After you read this stuff, your head is full, so you’ve got to dump it. Fouad said: ‘This is great Bruce. Let’s write a paper.’ Fouad later said: ‘Well, why don’t you think about coming back to Stanford and working as a graduate student.’ So I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1978, Hunt left Zilog for Stanford, ostensibly as a leave of absence. Estrin became the new project leader for Ariel. Rosenthal invited Hunt and Tobaji to present a paper at the May Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/9.7/The-Symposium/",

Presenters or session chairmen included: Metcalfe, Saltzer, Pogran, Hunt, Tobagi, Sunshine, Hopkins, Shoch and Cotton.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  To everyone’s surprise, an estimated four hundred people attended! For most, it was unbelievable event comparable in importance to the ICCC Arpanet Demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was exciting. There was electricity in the air. People didn’t know what to make of what NBS and MITRE were really up to. You had some of the leaders – you had Bob Metcalfe saying: ‘The world’s going to be a better place. There’s a need for this stuff.’ It was just really exciting. The result of the conference was the kind of exposure that I was real excited about. I was able to put together a group called a ‘local area networking group’ at NBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Brusil of MITRE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shortly after this, all of a sudden you start hearing companies’ names being announced and product intentions being announced. So it was almost a crystallization of the reality of the need for local networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember just being amazed at how many people were really interested in local area networks. I don’t know any researcher who secretly believes that what he’s doing is really important…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was one of the session chairmen. Saltzer was one of my session participants and he and Ken Pogran presented a star token ring. I believe to this day that if I had grabbed him by the neck and dragged him and threw him into the Charles River that day there would be no IBM Token Ring today. Saltzer was consulting for IBM in those days. And I was consulting for IBM for two days. And, he won. And IBM chose token ring in early 1979, largely for political reasons, but, it was the star ring – it was Saltzer’s star ring, the derivative of the ring from Dave Farber’s network at Irvine. So that May was the end of the five month period that I was consulting for MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming a little less than seven years after the Arpanet Demonstration of October 1972, the Symposium represented a defining moment in the emergence of local area networking. Soon flurries of company and product announcements added credence and substance to the promises of a technology that a few years earlier existed as just a dream of a few visionaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the participants left Boston there was no clear consensus as to the best access method: Ethernet, token ring, or one of a growing number of alternatives. Equally, the protocols required to make networks functional were in their formative stage and being developed largely independent of the access methods. And there remained the great divide between those who believed local area networks were primarily for terminal-to-host traffic versus those who championed computer-to-computer traffic. Nonetheless, the exploding constellation of technologies and economic potential had reached the critical point and the funding and control of government agencies and large corporations no longer could hold the center or channel the flow of ideas and people. Entrepreneurs sensed the time had come to act. And those first to act gave confidence to others. Cumulatively they would give rise to a new market, Networking, to join Data Communications in defining computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

The 1978 Revenue Act reduced the capital gains rate from 49 1/2% to 28%. The flow of monies into venture capital funds jumped from $68 million to nearly $1 billon. Then in 1979, Congress passed the ERISA “Prudent Man” Rule that allowed pension funds to invest in venture capital. Again, venture capital benefited.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe left the LACN Symposium more certain than ever that Ethernet had to be freed from the proprietary grasp of Xerox if it was to have a chance of impacting the coming commercialization of local area networking. Then came the welcomed news that the letter Gordon Bell of DEC had sent to three Xerox executives had generated interest. Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally I got a bilateral meeting to happen between Gordon Bell and David Liddle. And in the midst of this, I went to the National Bureau of Standards on another consulting contract. I was told the day before my visit, a guy who I have never met had been through from Intel, and he said he had some 25 megahertz chip technology and was looking for applications. And as soon as I heard this I had an idea: ‘Why don’t we just build an Ethernet chip with it?’ So I called up Intel and arranged a meeting. When I arrived, I was introduced to a guy named Phil Kaufman, who it turns out reported at the time to Andy Grove. They had assembled thirty to forty people for me to tell them a little about Ethernet and what they ought to do with it. I would normally get paid for consulting but I did it for free that day because it would have been embarrassing for me to leave. So I pitched them on how they ought to develop a custom chip for Ethernet. And the reason they ought to do it is that if DEC and Xerox were going to do this, they’re going to need chips and you guys can make the chips for their standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman, already a believer that communication chips would be significant “consumers of silicon,” remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was looking around at communications and the issue, obviously, came down to what protocols should be used. Now, the one protocol that had actually been used somewhere was Ethernet, as done at PARC. Everything else was inventing on the fly. We took a good look at Ethernet and all the papers that had been written and said: ‘It doesn’t matter whether it’s good or not, it exists and it works. Let’s see if we can take off from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddle remembers being contacted by Kaufman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intel contacted me and was interested in making a networking part primarily for IBM. They wanted to make a single part that could do both SDLC and Ethernet, and they wanted it to be variable speed and run real fast and all this kind of stuff. They were anxious that it should be at least ten megabits, maybe faster… The reasoning was very simple. Dr. Wang and IBM and all these people were after us, Xerox, because we had been running these very successful TV ads and were scaring everybody. Competitor claims were getting made that: ‘Oh yeah, but it’s really costly and it always will be.’ So I said: ‘If I want to get stuff that’s inexpensive, first of all I’ve got to show that I’ve got a semiconductor manufacturer who says: ‘We’ll make all the components so they’ll be cheap’ and secondly I need a down and dirty equipment vendor who makes modems and terminals and throw-away stuff, which was certainly Digital’s reputation at that time… So I thought this will get away from the image that this is a premium high-end expensive product, and it’ll encourage it. I wanted to start an industry at that moment. I didn’t want any proprietary network. I wanted to be able to say: ‘Look, I can hook to all this other gear that other people make.” I didn’t want to have a post hoc networking industry develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xerox and DEC invited Intel to join their meetings. Kaufman remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What our attorneys essentially told us was that we could not write a three-way agreement to work on the project to develop the technical specification even though we were explicitly going to put it in the public domain, and that we could not have tri-lateral meetings if there were any marketing people present from any company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe soon learned of the impasse. Concerned that lawyers might end the collaboration; he called his former college roommate, Howard Charney, an anti-trust expert, who had just finished suing IBM successfully on behalf of Memorex. Armed with the new knowledge that: “All you have to do is have a meeting whose purpose is expansion of markets and making of standards to be publicly disclosed” to avoid anti-trust problems,” Metcalfe again intervened, facilitating a three way meeting.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeing Ethernet from Xerox was but one of Metcalfe’s concerns that May of 1979. A second, and more emotional, issue was how to avoid being left behind in the coming commercialization of local area networking. As a consulting company of one, he knew he either had to grow a company and begin selling product or become marginalized. For others now believed as he did and they had every intention of starting companies to sell local area networking products. How did he know? Others were asking him to join them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Metcalfe knew his vision of networking desktop computers differed from the views of others - even as he also knew no existing desktop computers needed to be networked. Yet believing that if he did not stake claim to market leadership, the confusion created by others could leave him stranded, left behind and out of luck, an outcome he had no intention of letting happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 4th, Metcalfe and Gregory L. Shaw incorporated 3Com Corporation (3Com); for computers, communications and compatibility. Incorporation changed little. Metcalfe knew he needed a client to fund a growth in headcount, adding the pith and substance 3Com required to transition from consulting to a product company. Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I went to General Electric (GE) and said: ‘You should do home networking.’ They said: ‘Well, all right. Sure. Let’s work on it for a while.’ Consulting to GE is probably the deal that made the company because I was able to expand from one person to ten people, and in particular I was able to add Howard Charney.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; And eventually we got into designing a personal computer related to it. The personal computer thing got shelved, but we kept working on the home network called HomeNET. They paid us about three or four hundred thousand dollars over that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his consulting, Metcalfe continued to shepherd the three-way cooperation among Xerox, DEC, and Intel to make Ethernet public. Finally, that fall of 1979, the three firms met at the Boxborough Sheraton, Boxborough, MA. Acknowledging Metcalfe’s essential roll, he came to the pre-meeting dinner. The following day the technical teams of the three companies met, without marketing people or Metcalfe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe’s cares now revolved around 3Com and how to fund products that would conform to the technical specifications he confidently expected DEC, Intel and Xerox (to become known more familiarly as DIX) would negotiate and then publish. Metcalfe remembers:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We went from GE to Exxon. Exxon, in a deal that, I don’t know how I did it, but we got Exxon to agree to pay us to develop our first three products. We gave them fully paid up non-exclusive licenses and they allowed us to retain ownership of the technology. The contract was written that they could only use this technology in connection with an Exxon system. The three products were: TCP for UNIX, the Ethernet transceiver and the Ethernet adapter for the Unibus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com had a contract to build the three essential components for an Ethernet network: an adapter to connect to the computer, a transceiver to interconnect to the media, and protocol software to enable usefulness. The market focus would be interconnecting DEC Unibus computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; And while the UNIX operating system was not as widely used as DEC’s proprietary operating systems, UNIX was used often enough and porting TCP to UNIX had already been done by others. Why TCP for UNIX? Why not XNS, the protocol architecture developed under Metcalfe at SDD specifically for Ethernet? Metcalfe explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1980, 3Com Corporation was about to do its first product, very first product, which was to be some protocol software. And, Vint Cerf persuaded me, it didn’t take much persuading, but persuaded me, that we should implement TCP, because it was going to be a standard. Now, at that time XNS was a secret of Xerox, and I had just left Xerox. I couldn’t do XNS, even if I wanted to, but TCP was public domain. It was to be a standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1980, DEC, Intel and Xerox (i.e. DIX) made it official and announced they would publish their joint specification of Ethernet on September 30, 1980. Metcalfe knew he needed to raise significantly more capital than could be accumulated through profits if 3Com was to make the product and organizational investments required of a market leader. To raise the capital meant selling equity capital, a percentage of 3Com ownership, to venture capitalists (VCs). After writing a business plan, Metcalfe began meeting with VCs. Only venture capitalists refused to properly value the fact that 3Com was a going organization that had three “real” products.  Again Metcalfe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All the venture capitalists said: ‘No, this technology doesn’t matter because Exxon, you see, has a fully paid up non-exclusive license. They could just put you out of business.’ And I said: ‘You don’t understand. They’re not going to do anything with this technology. I mean, the chances that they’re going to compete with us in this technology are pretty small. And by the way the contract was written they could only use this technology in connection with an Exxon system.’ They said: ‘Ah, no, no, no. You’re first round.’ And I said: ‘No, no. We’re second round, and we own all this technology.’ ‘No, no, you’re first round.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of the argument: How much ownership would have to be relinquished to raise capital? The venture capitalist argued for as low a company valuation as possible so their investment would buy the maximum ownership. After all, they reasoned, 3Com’s revenue for the fiscal year ending May 1980 totaled only $281,000 and the company had sold rights to its technology to Exxon. So how real a company was it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 30, DIX published the Ethernet specification. Metcalfe felt backed into a corner and agreed to accept venture capital on the terms offered. But the venture capitalists made a new demand. They wanted to see an experienced executive hired to bring management competence to the largely engineering-staffed 3Com. Metcalfe, partly defensive and partly desperate to raise money, challenged the VCs to find the successful executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gib Meyers, a general partner of the Mayfield Fund venture capital partnership, responded by asking Metcalfe to meet Bill Krause, a “rising star” at Hewlett Packard (HP); Krause had managed HP’s successful minicomputer business from $50 million to $500 million in sales. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had just gotten knee deep into an assignment of getting HP into the PC business and had developed a strategy for HP to use Ethernet technology to network the PCs to become a competing alternative architecture to the HP 3000, which I launched. In other words, ‘better to have HP eat its own young rather than somebody else,’ and so Gib called and said – and he knew that I wanted to start a company and had had several conversations with him – so he said “You ought to meet this guy that we’ve been talking to that’s involved in starting a local area network company,” and I said: “Fine.  Who is it?” And he said: “It’s Bob Metcalfe.” I said: “He’s the inventor of Ethernet, you know, God, he’s an industry leader. I’d love to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a series of meetings, Krause made the leap and resigned from HP to join 3Com. He recalls his logic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had not met somebody as charismatic and smart as Bob Metcalfe, with one exception, Howard Charney, and I had not seen as strong a technical group as Ron Crane and Greg Shaw. So the first reason, as is always in venture capital, was the people. The second reason was that Bob and I shared exactly the same vision of how Ethernet was going to eventually be used for PCs. Third is that I really did think it was going to be the third wave of computing and I always thought that if you got in front of the mainstream of something, a lot of the rest was made easy.  I had joined HP just as they were getting into the minicomputer business, so that just made me getting on the fast track at HP a lot easier, being in front of something, of the new wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Krause joining as President, and Metcalfe assuming the CEO role, three venture capital funds, Mayfield, New Enterprise Associates and Melchor Venture Capital, invested $1.1 million on February 27, 1981. Paul Baran, who had joined 3Com’s Board of Directors in March 1980, invested as well. 3Com’s post-money valuation totaled $7.6 million, suggesting Metcalfe had prevailed in the battle over valuation. (Post-money valuation represents the total outstanding shares of a company’s stock times the price shares were sold at. Typically a first round financing would value the company at less than $5 million and generally less than $2 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Four years later, with a staff of forty-five dedicated to networking projects, Pliner needed no one to tell him local area networking was poised to take-off.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; Pliner had read all published material on local area networking and made an effort to meet anyone considered an expert, including Metcalfe and Bass. He also struggled with whether it was time to leave Ford, discouraged by the idea of simply starting a one-person company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pliner confided to four of his staff that he was thinking of leaving Ford, they immediately voiced their desire to join him. Planning began for the new company they would name Sytek. Pliner remembers trying to strengthen his team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charley Bass and Bob Metcalfe and I met regularly. We tried to convince Bob Metcalfe to join Sytek and he said ‘No, I want to run my own company.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1979, the five founders – Pliner, Ken Biba, Tom Berson, Jack Goldsmith, and Bob Kroll – incorporated Sytek and continued doing what they knew best: consulting. Their first client was none other than Xerox which gave them a $250,000 contract to write the communication protocols for their X10 Telecommunications Network. Other clients, such as Cox Cable, Hughes, TRW, and several government agencies, quickly followed and before they knew it they had completed their first year with fourteen clients, revenues of $1.3 million, and a bank balance of $300,000 that made possible the exploration of strategy options. Pliner recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1980 we took the money we made out of the consulting business and we said “let’s reinvest it and let’s try to build something,” and we decided to go different than everybody else, we went broadband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadband would differentiate Sytek from those firms employing the baseband technology of Ethernet. Broadband technology held the potential to carry both voice and video, in addition to data, and to support multiple simultaneous communication channels. Their competence in broadband represented a diffusion of technology from MITRE to Ford and now to Sytek. Lee LeBarrie of MITRE remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We went out to Ford Aerospace and talked to them, exchanged things – information. They were interested, of course, in the MITRENET CSMA. And the people who were involved in that effort actually split off and became Sytek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their first revenue opportunity came before they even had a broadband product to ship and would end their friendly relationship with Ungermann-Bass, the third local area networking firm to incorporate that June-July of 1979.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Forced out of Zilog at the end of 1978, Ungermann immediately began looking for the next great technological opportunity. His inclinations led him to communications: a field he had been in ever since 1967-1970 when he served on the staff of Art Collins, the founder of Collins Radio. Ungermann had participated in creating a time division multiplexer cabling system interconnecting much of the equipment in their state-of-the-art semiconductor factory – a precursor of local area networking. Leaving Collins Radio for Western Digital, Ungermann managed the development of the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transceiver) semiconductor chip; recognized as the first major communications semiconductor chip, funded by DEC and designed in large measure by Bell of DEC. He then joined Intel and created the first USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver and Transceiver) chip. At Zilog, he followed up with the very successful SIO chip, a two-port serial asynchronous/synchronous interface chip, an extension of his previous work. He remembers his search:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I talked to fifty companies and to a lot of people about what was going on and where they were going. What struck me was that every computer company was working on networking technology and every one told me the same thing: ‘Boy, just think, if we can control the wire, we’re going to control the business.’ It was clear to me that that’s not what the customer wanted and that there was an opportunity there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ungermann began talking to others in networking such as Metcalfe, wanting to be sure he was not deceiving himself, further perfecting his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for those Ungermann had hired at Zilog and left behind, it became a waiting game to see what Exxon, the parent company, would do next. Surely Exxon management must know their loyalties ran to Ungermann, not Zilog, and certainly not to Exxon. Not that many would have mourned their fate, for the self-confident swagger of Zilog that kept people working until they nearly fell asleep from exhaustion had sadly slipped into an unfamiliar world of tiring doubt that made coming to work reason to find new jobs. Ungermann recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charlie [Bass] decided, as everybody did, that his career wasn’t going to be at Zilog, so we decided to get together. We started kicking things around about what we’d do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as these conversations were going on, the new Zilog management team led by Manny Fernandez, recruited from Fairchild Semiconductor, tried to make sense of its future. To strengthen management, Fernandez raided his former employer and hired William (Bill) Carrico to be marketing manager for semiconductors. Fernandez soon asked Carrico to investigate the troubled systems group; the one Ungermann had led.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need to bring focus to an ambitious list of development projects, Carrico convened a series of strategy meetings in May-June 1979 attended by Bass, Estrin, Davidson, Joe Kennedy, Dave Folger and Phil Bellinger. Having just introduced their Z-8000 microprocessor, much of the discussion centered around issues such as: What is the systems business given microcomputers? Can microcomputers be architected to perform as one larger computer? Should they build a multi-user minicomputer? All questions begging answers to bring coherence to their product plans. In the sorting out of what needed to be done, and which projects should be cut, Folger suggested Ariel be used to interconnect more than just Z-80 or Z-8000 microcomputers, and be reconceptualized as an “intelligent wire.” One use could be to interconnect terminals to Zilog minicomputers as a terminal multiplexer.Ungermann Bass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1979, Bass resigned from Zilog and Ungermann and Bass incorporated their new company – Ungermann-Bass (UB). Ungermann later remarked in an interview with Data Communications magazine in 1980:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think people do what they know. My roots go back to engineering and local area networks and I’ve felt for a long time that local networks were someday going to make it big.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they had decided to focus on local area networking, Bass led an engineering team strengthened over the coming months with the additions of Davidson, Kennedy and five others from Zilog.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; After investigating and rejecting the use of broadband, Bass orchestrated consensus for Ethernet, influenced by rumors flying around about hush-hush talks between Xerox and DEC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the question of access method settled, the next question was which networking protocol software to use, TCP or XNS? Their decision to use the Z-80 microprocessor, a legacy from their Zilog days, dictated their choice. Davidson remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I looked very hard at whether to implement TCP in the original Z-80 product or XNS. But we were stuck with a very limited capability in our 64K [memory size] based Zilog Z-80 systems. I decided against the complexity of TCP, and that served us very well for several years, especially when Xerox came out with their office systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ungermann, meanwhile, began what would be an exasperating search for the venture capital needed to finance UB’s growth. Ungermann recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During that time, we talked to everybody in the financial community, and there were few venturers in the venture capital community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venture capitalists hesitated to invest because UB lacked a seasoned marketing/sales executive, a “third partner.” Once understood, Ungermann contacted management recruiters and soon learned of James (Jim) Jordan, vice-president of Sales of Four-Phase Systems, Inc., thought to be loose in the saddle. Jordan, a veteran of ten years with Four-Phase and with seven hundred people reporting to him, regularly received calls from headhunters eager to pitch him on their once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity. Routinely dismissing such calls, this time Jordan listened. On hearing UB intended to sell networking products he readily agreed to a meeting. Why? Jordan recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only time we ever lost to Datapoint was when Datapoint was selling a product that they called ARC. It wasn’t called ArcNet then, it was called ARC; Attached Resource Computing. It was connected by a real slow – at that time, nobody used the term ‘LAN’ – but it was basically connected by a real slow speed LAN. I spent a lot of time in product planning meetings at Four Phase and said: ‘Look, this is a problem. We need to be looking at it. This is the way of the future.’ But I just couldn’t convince the senior management that that was the way it was going to go. So I really believed in the whole concept of LANs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though UB had little cash and a staff of only fourteen engineers and no marketing people, Jordan’s experience competing against Datapoint had informed him for the opportunity and he made the “huge decision” to join UB in January 1980. Jordan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was bored to death. I thought it was a good idea. I liked the idea. I just believed in it. And I liked Ralph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Jordan’s help, UB management completed the business plan and in February closed their initial round of financing, raising $1.5 million with a company valuation of $2.2 million. Bessemer Venture Partners, Oak Investment Partners and Venad Associates divided the investment.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same month, UB announced their first product: the Network Interface Unit-1, or NIU-1. The NIU-1, an Ethernet terminal switch that could be configured to support from eight to thirty-two asynchronous terminals, would ship in July; making UB the first company to ship unbundled Ethernet products. (Xerox had shipped Ethernet but only as part of a system.) In addition, UB publicized its vision of “vendor independent networking,” a vision very different than Metcalfe’s and 3Com’s “personal computer networking.” Jordan reflects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You honestly have to give Ralph a lot of credit. He was really the strategist on it. The marketplace was really viewed as all this large installed base by multiple vendors, so you’ve got all this DEC, IBM, Data General and HP gear, so where’s the market?  Well, the market is trying to get some communication capability between this heterogeneous installed base, so that’s why, if you go back in the early days, and look at all the Ungermann-Bass stuff, it talks about vendor independent networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late spring of 1980, UB received inquiries from both Bolt Beraneck and Newmann (BBN) and Sytek. Each intended to bid the NIU-1 on a major RFPQ (Request for Price Quotation) being let by MIT Lincoln Labs. Bass remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re cooperating with both BBN and Sytek, giving them everything we could to allow them to bid our product and win this contract. And we were feeling like we were in the catbird seat, that we had both of these guys bidding our product, and we’re pumping them with information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management’s optimism turned to frustrating disappointment in September. Again Bass:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We got a call from BBN. They said: ‘Well, bad news. We lost to Sytek.’ And we said:  ‘Oh, too bad,’ and we hung up the phone and cheered – Only to learn that Sytek had bid their own product. Well, from that day forward they were the enemy, and they were the company to hate. Now, I think we overdid it and all this got blown out of proportion, but it probably helped motivationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pliner, President of Sytek, also remembers the Lincoln Labs decision:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lincoln Labs wanted a high-speed, host-to-host interconnectivity product.  And we said ‘Why don’t you go buy Ungermann-Bass?’, and they said, ‘No, we want a broadband network.’ We bid two options: Ungermann-Bass and our high-speed broadband network that we never had, it was going to have to be developed.  We won the bid on our second option. To this day, I believe Ralph still thinks that I used him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sale seemed a struggle and invariably competition with a dataPBX. Jordan explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The LAN companies lost business to the dataPBX guys for a while, because you couldn’t really do much more for the user than a dataPBX could. You could tell him that you could, and you had a growth path and they didn’t, and all that kind of stuff, but you couldn’t do that much more for him right then. And big dataPBXs, in large configurations, were $300 a port, maybe $200 a port whereas our initial pricing was something like $650 to $700 per port. For us there was a real push to get to $500 per port – it seemed to be the magic number at that point in time.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving the cost problem would take time. Until then, Jordan had to find customers who would buy into the bigger vision of networking; customers willing to buy a promised future now. Jordan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was totally a technology pitch, because you couldn’t really provide an application solution, so you’d tell them how great the technology was: ‘This thing runs at ten megabits,’ and ‘Wow, gee whiz.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fledgling LAN start-ups also lacked the substantial financial and organizational resources and enviable market presence of the data communication companies. What they did have was vision and entrepreneurial drive and those differences would prove substantial.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Norred’s search for his replacement as Vice President of Development went quickly. Stephen W. Frankel knew as soon as he met Norred that he wanted to work for Micom. Frankel had spent the last seven years at another small data communication start-up, Tran Telecommunications, Inc. (Tran) – one of the earliest innovators of data PBX’s – where he had risen from software engineer to both Vice President of Engineering and Vice President of Marketing. When Tran agreed to be acquired by Amdahl, Frankel decided he had no interest remaining simply an employee, and began looking for an entrepreneurial opportunity. Seriously considering a new start-up, he then met Norred. They had an instant meeting of minds and he joined Micom in January 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankel faced two immediate challenges: staffing an organization and finishing the development a number of products. Frankel remembers inheriting an organization consisting of: “Bill Norred and one very capable programmer and a couple of helpers and that was it.” Only Norred had little time for engineering, as he became absorbed in his expanded presidential responsibilities. Adding personnel became Frankel’s priority, for without staff, there was no chance of completing the unprecedented number of projects in process. Fortunately, four of the six projects were variations of the Data Concentrator, including adding modems for the first time.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; The Micro600 Port Selector, on the other hand, qualified as a truly challenging new development.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as prior experience engineering dataPBXs, Frankel brought with him the personal energy and management discipline needed by Micom. He remembers the state of the Micro600 when he assumed responsibility for the project:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dataPBX didn’t work particularly well. It was in development and, not too much after I got there, it was going out in beta testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the Micro600 had problems is small wonder given its architectural history. Norred had first proposed building a dataPBX for Case, one to replace the one they were OEM’ing from Gandalf in 1973.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Case had declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years, later another customer, International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), needed a telex switch to selectively monitor different ports and lines for problems. Norred developed a product that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In effect, was the architecture of the dataPBX. But to be perfectly honest, I don’t even remember how we got from A to B in the dataPBX.  I know that we developed it on the basis of taking our 5040 controller and developing the switching module which caused all the switching to take place. I remember, it was a product that was built for ITT with, almost by pointing, not by drawings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1977, another customer, Computer Science Corporation (CSC), needed a product to connect lots of terminals with multiple computers. Norred recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CSC was instrumental in the dataPBX as well, from a market standpoint, because they also were getting ready to buy a lot of these Infotron switches. Seems like we used to stay very close with CSC, in terms of what was going on. They were our customer that was very close in providing a lot of input to us and the direction we went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micom began shipping their Micro 600 Port Selector in 1980. (Exhibit 7.2 Micom Micro600 Port Selector) Although not called a dataPBX, it was one: interconnecting many terminals and peripherals to multiple computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-9121-micom-micro600-port-selector&quot;&gt;Exhibit 9.12.1 Micom Micro600 Port Selector&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_9.12.1_Micom_Micro600_Port_Selector.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Micom Mocro600 Port Selector&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueled in part by the instant success of the Micro600, sales soared to $32.8 million for fiscal year ending March 1981, up 112% over 1980; straining Micom’s ability to finance growth from profits and its small capital base. With only $67,000 in cash and over $2 million in debt at March year-end, Norred and Evans welcomed investment bankers who told them the nearly decade-long dormant IPO market for technology companies showed stirrings of life, and that they should be prepared to take advantage of any window of opportunity. Their venture capital shareholders concurred, and given the incontestable fact that they needed capital if they were to satisfy the insatiable demand for their products, raising equity at the prices public investors were represented as willing to pay, well, it seemed like a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 21, 1981, Micom issued its Preliminary Prospectus and the investment bankers began coaching Norred and Evans for the road show: when management makes presentations to potential institutional investors in hopes of selling them on becoming buyers of stock on the offering. Before the road show began, Norred and Evans attended the important Interface trade show where Micom and all other leading data communication firms had booths. Catching them by surprise, Codex announced new multiplexers meant to replace the ones they were OEM’ing from Micom. Since Codex was a significant OEM customer, and OEM sales constituted 18% of Micom’s sales, the investment bankers expressed alarm, implying Micom’s business prospects looked far less attractive, and the IPO might have to be postponed, if not canceled. A financial disaster loomed. Norred and Evans tracked Carr down and asked if they could meet with him privately, over a cup of coffee. After nervous pleasantries, Carr remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roger said something like:  “So you won’t buy any more of these?”  And I said: “First off, nothing stops like a curtain coming down. We’ll have some number of these we’ll buy from you on probably a declining basis as ours comes up, but we’re interested in buying something else.” So he said: “You’re telling me you’re still going to keep buying from me?” And I said:  “That’s what I’m telling you and that’s what you want to hear, Roger.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the IPO back on track, Norred and Evans began one of the simultaneously most exciting and most nerve-racking times for successful entrepreneurs: the road show. Through nineteen presentations, and an equal number of question and answer sessions, and breakfast, lunch and dinner meetings with the most prized investors crammed into a punishing travel schedule, and all the while unable to wait until the next time a quiet phone call could be made back to their office to make sure the company continued to operate smoothly throughout their month long absence, through all of this Norred and Evans excelled as they told Micom’s story: Micom sells low cost, easy-to-use data communication products to minicomputer users. The market for connecting terminals to remote minicomputers was growing faster than 23% per annum, the market was only 14% penetrated and Micom holds a commanding 85% market share. As for Timeplex and Infotron, they targeted their statistical multiplexers to customers interested in networking, and therefore innovated their products to be feature rich. Micom emphasized low cost and ease-of-use: the “box business,” not networking. It was a story that sounded like music to investors’ ears. It was also a story meant to be easy to absorb and mentioned little of the Micro600 Port Selector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 19, 1981, Micom Systems, Inc. went public at $30.00 per share, raising in excess of $25 million with a market capitalization of nearly $190 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norred and Evans were committed to the strategy of selling boxes and of not getting into the much more complex networking business. What they did not realize, however, was their new Micro600 Port Selector product, the dataPBX, would soon take them in directions challenging not only to their business strategy but their very existence.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When Codex began shipping their yet-fully-working 6000 Series statistical multiplexers in 1977, they had to ship engineers to customer sites to make it work. Being offsite, out from under the watchful eye of management, rather than down the hall or in the building next door, engineers heard and identified with customers’ plights. Displaying initiative or a just-for-the-joy-of-doing-it, an engineer created a prototype of a new switch before approaching management in 1979 seeking to start a new product line. Pugh, now in strategic marketing after the merger with Motorola in 1978, recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a development program that was not spec’d by marketing. It was something that one of the engineers did for a couple of customers. And apparently our controls weren’t tight enough, because we let him do it. And then he came to marketing and he said, ‘Gee. I got this thing here that will do all these things.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Codex introduced their IMS 7700, a product that switched incoming telecommunication links, whether leased line or dial-up, to multiple computers. It, like their statistical multiplexers, required extensive configuration to satisfy a customer’s needs. From field experience, they learned that it could be configured as either a dataPBX or a matrix switch. Pugh remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dataPBX was really more of a premise-type product as opposed to wide-area network product which the matrix switch was. And the matrix switch was a survival-type product which was involved in dedicated lines and the dataPBX was really a dial-type product and we weren’t strong in the dial business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex’s management, meanwhile had defined a new post-Motorola merger vision of: “integrated communications.” A vision that left uncertain room for dial-up products. Carr summarized the vision to the press in April 1981 as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Codex products will tackle problems of exchange, getting information into the network; transport, getting information through the network to its destination; and command, controlling the network from a central site.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex’s definition of a network was a wide area network, from the building out into the network as it were, not an intra-building or premises-type network. As a definition, it would lead Codex into new product growth directions, as well as keep them from investing in products that were seen as intra-building or premises-type, such as dataPBXs and LANs. Nevertheless, in an example of the sheer momentum of having existing products, before the end of 1981, Codex introduced their new IMS 7800 dataPBX and matrix switch.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Micom and Codex introduced dataPBXs; not from having a grand vision of emerging market dynamics, but in response to specific customers needs to interconnect their growing base of terminals to their growing numbers of computers. Creating a dataPBX proved to be a small step after mastering statistical multiplexing. No big decisions committing large development programs or extensive market research were required.  Not having done so, however, would have unexpected consequences.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;With each passing month of 1980, UB management, regardless of role, felt the stress to find customers. Charlie Bass discovered the first significant opportunity when, over a dinner with David Liddle in San Francisco, he learned Xerox needed a product to interconnect their Star product to asynchronous terminals and peripherals of other vendors. Bass pitched Liddle on using UB’s NIU-1s that UB would OEM to Xerox. Intrigued, Liddle asked if UB would be willing to conform their version of XNS to Xerox’s and upgrade to the 10 megabit per second Ethernet. Without hesitation Bass committed to doing so, knowing that being able to claim interoperability with Xerox’s products gave UB valuable credibility. Before the end of the year a handshake sealed the agreement with specifics and timetables to be negotiated. Davidson remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Only then did they [Xerox] realize that they had forgotten to connect in any foreign equipment, and then they looked around for how they would do that quickly, and they found our terminal servers to fit the bill if we would A) adopt the ten megabit standard, because we had built four megabits on our own, and B) change the protocols to be compatible with what Xerox was actually using, which we were delighted to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the handshake with Xerox, for a product that would not be available until well into 1981, UB found being first to market little consolation. It seemed to matter little to investors whose enthusiasm for networking investments let UB close their second round of venture capital financing in November, raising $4.972 million on a nearly eight times step-up in company value to $19 million. For fiscal, and calendar, year 1980, UB had sales of $436,000 with a loss of $1.2 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To convert the Xerox handshake into formal contracts and then manage the on-going OEM relationship, management courted Judy Estrin of Zilog. Following the exodus of engineers to UB in 1979, Estrin had been promoted to engineering manager for networking, and Carrico had become business unit manager. At the June 1980 National Computer Conference trade show, Zilog had introduced their Z-Net LAN, a scaled-down Ethernet made possible by the dissemination of information out of PARC and the social structure existing between the employees of PARC and Zilog. Zilog’s future, however, turned increasingly on decisions made by Exxon Office Systems and networking seemed to interest no one. Estrin remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We spent an infinite amount of time trying to deal with Exxon Office Systems – trying to get them to use the Z-Net technology.  It was just, politically, very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year-end 1980, Estrin had had enough and, assured by Ungermann that he had learned the importance of focus from his Zilog experience, she joined UB on February 1, reporting to Jordan and responsible for the Xerox account. Estrin remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the things I felt at Zilog is they were doing too many things, trying to be too much, and I even remember sitting with Ralph before I accepted the offer and saying: “You did this at Zilog. Are you going to do this again?” “Absolutely, positively, not. We’re going to focus, we’re going to do this,” and I got to UB, and they had their first product out, and they were going in a million directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration of directions even included a conversation with Evans of Micom, their dataPBX nemesis. Bass remembers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember meeting with Roger Evans. We were looking at ways – they had used Z-80s, so we knew each other from the Zilog days, and we were sizing each other up, looking for ways to cooperate –the wonderful thing about this business is you can sit down with your arch enemy and explore common interests, and I think we were trying to see how these technologies might converge, how we might do something together. It didn’t get anywhere, but we certainly had the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after Sytek introduced their broadband LocalNet 20 in February 1981, UB management found they had more than dataPBXs to contend with. For it did not take long for the low cost and futuristic appeal of broadband to handle voice and video (not to say anything about the hatred that existed between UB and Sytek) to prompt UB management to justify broadband products as consistent with their vendor independent strategy. To jump-start development, Bass suggested they recruit Gregory Hopkins of MITRE, an acknowledged expert in broadband and holder of patents regarding CSMA/CD over broadband. In June, Hopkins joined UB starting an office Burlington, MA. [24] Jordan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We started this broadband engineering operation in Burlington. It worked for me. I don’t remember why. Looking back on it, it’s probably a great way to start a rift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineering also had to be gearing up to introduce new, lower cost products once Ethernet chips were available from Intel. Ungermann knew the risks of waiting but there seemed little choice given the expense of doing their own silicon. Then luck knocked on their door and an alternative appeared. Bass remembers learning about Silicon Compilers, a new start-up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were approached by Kleiner Perkins, who was then an investor, and they had this company that had a silicon compiler. They came and they wanted to test their technology on something hard. So we said: “Well, we’ve got something hard for you. We’d like to have an Ethernet chip.” So they come in and they started running equations and talking to Alan Goodrich, who was our hardware designer. And we learned a lot about their tools and what it’s going to take to build one of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything going UB’s way, in July 1981 they announced their fully compliant 10 megabit Ethernet NUI executing fully compliant XNS. Success seemed assured.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1981, with the fiscal year about to end, management met to set the annual operating plan for the coming year. Krause argued the need to aggressively reduce product costs using semiconductor technology to reduce chip count and printed circuit board space, known as “real estate.” Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are very few things that I blew Bob away with, but this was one of them. [See Exhibit 7.3 3Com Learning Curve]. I said: “OK, this is 1981 and this is 1986 and we’ve got to go from here to here.” And Bob said: “What do you mean? How are we going to do that?” So I said: “Well, Bob, first of all, that’s your job, figuring out how we’re going to do it, but if we’re going to make a mass market out of this, and we’re going to connect PCs together, we’ve got to go from here to here, because taking a $2,000 Apple and spending $4,000 to connect it isn’t going to compute. So we’ve got to figure out how to do that. And a way to do that is through semiconductor VLSI integration over time, so let’s start with our Unibus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe agreed. However, when two other new product ideas were suggested, an Ethernet controller for Apple computers – or any of the other existing personal computers – or a terminal server, Metcalfe remained unyielding, quickly ending any discussion. Here Metcalfe’s vision of networking as personal computers networked with Ethernet can be seen as guiding action. Metcalfe considered the existing personal computers as little more than toys. He was certain that sufficiently powerful personal computers would become available, and preferred simply to wait. Even the compelling argument that Ungermann-Bass was growing rapidly by selling terminal servers would not change Metcalfe’s thinking. Metcalfe recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stubbornly stuck with the idea that, “No, no, no. Connecting terminals to CPUs is a relatively low grade application of my technology.” It was intended to connect PCs together.  Our problem was that there weren’t any PCs, or rather the PCs that existed were Apple IIs, which cost $1500 and Ethernet in those days cost $4300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe and Krause recognized their existing products were unlikely to generate enough sales to attain profitability and they had to develop products that had large sales potential and volumes to justify the cost and effort of VLSI.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; To stimulate their thinking, Metcalfe arranged for the two of them to visit both PARC and Stanford. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bob was trying to educate me about the Ethernet Gestalt, so he took me over to PARC and wandered me around there, and he took me over to Stanford, and he introduced me to this guy who was working on something called the Stanford University Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-9161-3com-learning-curve&quot;&gt;Exhibit 9.16.1 3Com Learning Curve&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-9.16.1_3COM_Learning_Curve.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of 3COM Learning Curve&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategizing afterwards, Metcalfe and Krause agreed that the next product 3Com should build was an Ethernet adaptor for Multibus, the bus being employed in the Stanford University Network and favored by those employing the new Motorola microprocessors. While not necessarily the home run they wanted, it leveraged their existing competences and seemed like a solid product to add to their product line and would use the chips they intended to design and develop while they waited for a real PC to be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The year 1979 saw local area networking transition from a research effort to a technology around which entrepreneurs raised venture capital and set out to build products and hopefully successful companies. And just like the mixed opinions as to what were the first, and maybe even best, uses for these new technologies that had been a leitmotif of the NBS and MITRE Workshops, so too the entrepreneurs differed. Metcalfe knew the answer, even arguing for the terminology local computer networking, and keeping his new company 3Com religiously focused on interconnecting computers as they waited for an affordable and real desktop computer to be introduced. Ungermann and Bass were much more practical: they knew customers wanted to interconnect their growing legions of terminals to multiple computers. They also proved early on that they were not even wedded to Ethernet, as was 3Com. Sytek, the third important start-up of the spring of 1979, showed its roots as well by introducing a low-cost broadband terminal server after a year of doing what they knew best, consulting. The breakout of these three firms would inspire others, who would contribute to very crowded competition in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even as these Networking firms jostled amongst themselves, they had even more serious competition from the firms of Data Communication selling dataPBXs. These firms were responding to real needs of real customers, not venturing after the uncertain. Micom had been incrementally innovating a product ever since its earliest days when it sought to get Case to replace its Gandalf dataPBXs with one of their own. So when they finally launched a product one might have thought they had gotten it right. Only they would become victims of their own delimiting ideas of what communications was about. The same could be said about Codex if they had stayed the course longer. But the firms of Data Communications had no idea of the discontinuity about to be launched by IBM and would take years, too many years, to read the tea leaves correctly. So just as the world of Networking was being sized up as LAN terminal servers vs dataPBXs, it was about to change. Not because the behemoth IBM knew what it was unleashing, but because it had decided to get out of its own way and stumbled happily upon the insatiable demand for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.0/Overview/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs needed no crystal balls of market demand to know that if they did not launch their companies soon they risked being left behind. Each felt they viewed the market advantageously and would collectively confuse potential customers with newer versions of Ethernet (Interlan and Bridge Communications), token ring (Proteon), token bus (Concord Data Systems), and scores of proprietary local area networks (LANs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAN start-ups and dataPBX firms were reacting to the needs of customers wanting to connect computers to computers, or terminals to multiple computers. Market experts, meanwhile, held a grander vision of computers transforming the office and corporate enterprise. Labeled “The Office of the Future,” it was an economic prize worthy of any strategic plan. And who better than the entrenched PBX firms, already interconnecting and switching voice communications, to simply add data services. In fact, the analog PBXs were already transitioning to computer-based PBXs, or computer branch exchanges (CBXs). The dominant PBX firm, AT&amp;amp;T, however, was constrained from introducing a CBX by the Federal Communication Commission, and was thus rapidly losing market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in August 1981, IBM introduced its personal computer: the IBM PC. In a few short years, the IBM PC would overturn the paradigm of desktop terminals with one of desktop computers. It was a wave of creative destruction that would sink the hopes of the CBX manufacturers. IBM was equally caught off guard, lacking a LAN solution to interconnect even their computers. In a rash of “not invented here,” IBM management selected an unproven token ring rather than back the choice of some of its competitors: Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com embraced the introduction of the IBM PC. It was a non-event for both Ungermann-Bass and Sytek who remained focused on their existing strategies. Soon many more companies began offering LANs, including Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Excelan, CMC and even General Electric. Data communication competitors joined Micom and Codex in selling dataPBXs. In total, nearly 200 firms announced networking products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tide of market deregulation that began with Carterfone in 1968 came to a roaring crash in 1982 when AT&amp;amp;T agreed to disbandment. Now freed to compete, AT&amp;amp;T still took over a year to introduce a CBX. IBM also evaded the constraints of anti-trust when their suit was dismissed. It did little to change either the unexpected success of the IBM PC or the ever-receding market introduction of their token ring LAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1981-1982, the obvious choice of the PBX and the unanticipated surprise of the IBM PC made life challenging for the hundreds of companies selling products to interconnect computers and terminals. Customer confusion can be read in the disappointing sales of networking products for 1982. LAN sales were a bitter $63 million. DataPBX sales limped to $45 million. But the future was about to change markedly. In 1986, LAN sales would soar to $1 billion. The dataPBX would be left behind at $86 million. Now to a peek into the dynamics leading to utter confusion.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.1/Interlan/",

He knew he could no longer repress what he longed to do most: start a company. Uncertain as to what the company’s focus might be, he searched for a compelling idea, a vision of economic potential around which to organize a company. First he drew upon his own experiences and his hard earned lessons: computer design and networking at Prime, bus level products at Data Translation, and the OEM strategy so key to DEC. He then scanned the technical and trade literature, imagining numerous fits of promising technologies and his competencies. And then he saw Xerox’s Ethernet Blue Book. Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I just thought it was time for me to do something else. So I started to think about computer networks, but I couldn’t see it until I saw the first Blue Book. The biggest problem you have doing something proprietary from a small company is that nobody wants to buy it. So, if this thing really looks like it could be a standard, this is the place to do it. And there was only really one company that was visible in LANs and that was Ungermann-Bass. 3Com hadn’t really announced any products yet, and it was really a consulting house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a sanity check, Severino sought the counsel of a few trusted friends, such as Russ Planiter, a Vice President of Prime. Over a few dinner conversations they kicked ideas around until early October when Severino laid out the case for local area networking. Planiter listened more intently than usual because he had decided to leave Prime to join the venture capital partnership J. H. Whitney and knew he needed to find investment opportunities. Planiter offered to work on a plan together, if he could have a first right of refusal. Severino, knowing he needed financial backing and knowing no one he would rather have as an investor, readily agreed. Severino recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So that’s what we did, and we built this business plan about a LAN company that was going to be board level oriented, which was a different approach from what was going on then. The first computers we would connect to were Unibus, Multibus and Q-bus machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They thought their plan sound, but others were decidedly less eager to invest. Severino and Planiter listened as his new partners told them that they needed an Ethernet expert. The obvious place to look was DEC and they soon identified Dave Potter as the best candidate. Again Severino:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One Saturday morning, I just gave him a call, told him who I was, what I was doing, and told him I wanted to talk to him about starting an Ethernet company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1981, with Potter’s agreement to join Severino, the partners of J. H. Whitney agreed to invest. On June 1, 1981, Severino formed Interlan, Incorporated. Work began immediately with the intent to develop products and have them available for sale by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.2/Bridge-Communications/",

Carrico recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The irony of it is that, while I was trying to decide what to do with myself, and while Judy was at Ungermann-Bass, I talked to Ralph about coming over and working with Ungermann-Bass, and he just kind of dismissed me out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Carrico told Estrin that he intended to leave Zilog, Estrin confided that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, I sensed that I had made a mistake in that I was in a role that just wasn’t fulfilling to me. I had come into a role without enough responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having worked very closely and successfully together at Zilog, Carrico and Estrin easily turned their similar discontents into reason to start a company together. However, Estrin first wanted to complete the UB OEM agreement with Xerox for XNS, which she did in May. She then resigned from UB, evoking both surprise and shock – no one left a high-profile start-up, and certainly not after just five months. Once it became clear that she was founding a competitive company, feelings of many at UB turned to resentment and even anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1981, Carrico and Estrin incorporated Bridge Communications. They first looked to carve out a new strategy rather than simply imitate others. As they enumerated the existing companies and strategies, they envisioned a world populated with incompatible networks and users’ needs to interconnect them: How would computers and devices on a Zilog network connect to those on an Ethernet network? And what about the problems of interconnecting XNS networks to TCP networks? What was going to happen when IBM introduced their rumored token ring network? Estrin remembers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, when we started Bridge, we didn’t have the intention to compete against Ungermann-Bass. Our first business plan was very focused on bridges and gateways, but as internetworking, connecting networks, as opposed to the networks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as they began product design, they saw a common product architecture would allow them to develop the desired bridges and gateways as well as network controllers. And, since few networks existed needing to be interconnected, logic prevailed and they broadened their vision to include Ethernet controllers and terminal servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business plan came quickly after the vision, but they lacked personal funds to bankroll a company and had little choice but to run the venture capital gauntlet, which fell to Carrico. Estrin began consulting to pay their living expenses. Estrin remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During that six month period when we were raising money, I went to consult for Xerox, and what I did for Xerox was help document their XNS protocols, which then were put in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrico remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We did Ethernet and XNS because those were the things that were closest to being a standard, and from day one, we felt that standards were going to be the key to our business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 25, 1981, four founders, Carrico, Estrin, Eric Benhamou and Jean-Pierre Boespflug, incorporated Bridge Communications. Between a first closing in December and a second closing in February 1982, they sold $1,835,000 of Series A Preferred Stock to venture capitalists with a post-money valuation of $2.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.3/Proteon/",

But it took Proteon until June 1981 to deliver working boards. In the same month, Proteon made its first commercial shipment, to UCLA, and in August, its first international sale, to the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment. The availability of token-ring controllers barely caused a ripple in the gathering tide of Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.4/Concord-Data-Systems/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1979, Ken Miller, Director of Modem Development for Codex - the largest modem company in the world - wondered if this was all he was meant to be, an employee addicted to the safety net of a large company, deadened to the excitement that once made coming to work meaningful. Somehow in the process of becoming large, Codex’s burgeoning bureaucracy had stifled the boldness, and yes fun, of the cash-strapped, “let’s go for it” company Miller joined in 1972. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got frustrated. A lot of people at Codex got frustrated then because they were used to the early days, the early go-go years when you could get things done easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wanted to work in a small company culture, a culture of deciding and acting, a “make it happen” environment. He wanted to be like those who had already left Codex and successfully started their own companies: Jerry Holsinger, founder of Intertel, and Jim VanderMaye, Integral Data Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller’s frustrations grew from his inability to convince his superiors to enter a new product market. When promoted to Director of Modem Development, Miller became Codex’s representative to the CCITT modem standards committees. There he learned of a new 1200 bps dial-up modem standard – V.22 – being established. Since no firm then sold a V.22 modem, Codex had as good a chance as any other firm to dominate. For over a year he had been returning from CCITT meetings, filled with entrepreneurial enthusiasm, committed to selling Codex management on the opportunity to expand beyond their exclusively lease-line modem focus. But every time his efforts were thwarted, slowly buried in successive rounds of meetings and never-ending memos. To Miller it made no sense and begged the question of why he remained at Codex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proximate cause to consider leaving Codex, however, was the company’s recent move from Newton to Mansfield, MA. A tolerable commute had become downright ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to move, especially if I was uncertain about Codex. But then, I mean, I always liked small companies. I had a secret wish that Dave Forney would go start a new company so I could go join him, but – and at the time I didn’t really – I had always had a little bit of a dream of starting a company, but never really had the guts to do it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as if a prayer had been answered, he received a phone call from a former Codex engineer, Mike Kryskow, now working at Gould-Modicon. Miller remembers the catalytic question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hey, we’re working on some future networking stuff, and it’s really communications, and we got all these consultants in here and they don’t know what they’re doing and we need some help. Could you consult?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he wouldn’t have given such a proposal a moment’s thought, but then he had never considered leaving Codex before. Surprising even himself, he said: “O.K., I’ll come up and look.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller consulted over the 1979 year-end holidays and knew he had not been misled. There just might be life outside Codex and products other than modems. After the first of the year, he made calls to friends in other companies and discovered numerous consulting opportunities and soon gave notice at Codex, leaving in the middle of March. Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was the most gut-wrenching thing for me to do, because I’m leaving a salary. I had a wife and kids and a mortgage and everything else and I mean, I would have to bring the bacon in and I didn’t have a job. I had to go scrounge it up. But the opportunities that came by were just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1980, Miller formed Miller Associates. He continued consulting to Gould-Modicon on their efforts to create a communication network able to meet the rigorous real-time needs of manufacturing; a network interconnecting factory floor equipment with the computers controlling and directing manufacturing. Miller also learned that Gould/Modicon was not the only company thinking about networking computers and peripherals. Kryskow, however, had devised a new scheme, to become known as token bus, and Miller, convinced of the unique needs of factory automation, became thoroughly “enamored with token bus.” Token bus differed from token ring in topology: the token is broadcast over a bus instead of passed in a ring. The broadcast token contained only one address, that of the next station authorized to communicate, the token address then would be updated at the next station similar to the mechanism of token ring. Miller believed the deterministic behavior of token passing crucial to factory automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within months, Miller came into contact with a whole new community of local area networking believers who reinforced his sense that something special was happening. Miller recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, back then, local networks were really in their infancy. So I looked around and said: ‘There’s opportunity here. All these people participating are computer people. This isn’t a computer problem, this is a data communication problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer people he met kept talking about Ethernet. But for Miller, Ethernet had a serious problem: it could not guarantee an access response time, because it was based on probabilistic access. Furthermore, the longer the medium, the greater the propagation delay which aggravated indeterminate response times. An uncertain response time might be acceptable for office automation, but Miller knew it had no chance of satisfying the real time needs of factory automation. Token bus, on the other hand, could guarantee response times. Assuming this insight was one the computer-types had glossed over, Miller saw a golden opportunity to transform Miller Associates into a product company selling token bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Miller had so much consulting work he had no time to devote to token bus. Uncertain as to what to do, Miller convened a small group of friends whom he thought might be interested in joining a start-up for a planning session between Christmas and New Years, 1980, at the Colonial Inn in Concord, MA. Not attending the meeting, but critical to being seen as a credible token bus company, was Kryskow of Gould-Modicon who had committed to join Miller’s new company. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean I came up with a basic approach which we talked about. It was a three or four hour meeting. It was a basic strategy. We said: ‘Hey, look. We want to do token bus LANs, but that’s a long-range thing, I mean, we’re committed to standards, and a standard doesn’t exist, so one of the things we have to do is get it through the standards committee. There’s a lot of work. It’s a system-oriented product. But we also have identified this other thing that we know a hell of a lot about. It’s a market that’s here and now. It’s dial modems. And so, let’s do both. There’s a short range strategy, get the company going, and the longer range one which we thought, at the time, would be a higher growth field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They encouraged Miller to write a business plan, a prerequisite before meeting venture capitalists. After months of drafts and redrafts, Miller began meeting with anyone who would see him. He remembers one surprising presentation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My neighbor knew another person who knew Tom Stevenson who was President of Fidelity Ventures. I went in there. That was very interesting because I was preaching the gospel of token passing. I’ll never forget that day because I went in and was telling him why token passing is better than Ethernet and this guy is giving me all these technical arguments about Ethernet. I said: ‘ How the hell does this guy know this?’ It turns out he had just gotten aced out from investing in 3Com and he had been filled with all of Metcalfe’s propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing he needed help, Miller recruited a financial consultant, John Plakans, to help him polish his plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that Plakans knew Kevin Landry of TA Associates, the venture capital firm. So we got an introduction through him, and Kevin and Andy McLane came out and visited. My neighbor was employed with Analog Devices Enterprises so I also talked to them, among other venture capital sources. Lo and behold, we got offers both from TA and Analog Devices. Analog Devices said we’ll only give you a certain amount of money and then you’ve got to have a progress payment and, if you meet some milestones you get more and I said: ‘Ah, screw that shit. Who knows, this is a volatile business. You could end up changing direction. I don’t want to get too constrained.’ And also, it was a clear direction. If you were with Analog, you were going to get acquired. So we went with TA and closed $1.4 million in May, 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potentially devastating confrontation at a company meeting happened soon afterwards. Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got a bit panicked because Mike Kryskow was going bananas! We had a company meeting one time and he said: ‘You’re not flamboyant enough to be President. You’d be a good VP of Engineering. We need to go get another President.’ I said: ‘God damn it, NO!’ And the guy finally didn’t join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing he needed a token passing expert, Miller then recruited Tom Phinney of Honeywell to replace Kryskow. Phinney, however, would not leave Phoenix, AZ. Miller, feeling he had little choice, caved and agreed to locate Concord Data Systems’ LAN expert nearly a continent away.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.5/The-Office-of-the-Future,-the-PBX-to-CBX,-and-AT&T/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The grandiloquent yet vague vision expressed as The Office of the Future cast a presentable spin on what was largely white-collar automation. As a vision it served exactly the same purpose as Licklider’s InterGalactic Network: to guide the coalescence of the creators and users of technology into a shared future.  There was little doubt about the need for information automation. Lewis Brascomb, Chief Scientist of IBM, would write as late as 1983:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One consultant estimates that there are eight file drawers containing 18,000 documents for every white-collar worker in the United States…The information explosion, it seems, is proceeding at the rate of two file drawers per office worker per year.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1981, the Office of the Future vision did not need to be precise, or understood, for many of the technologies and user needs remained undefined. What seemed assured, however, was that all the voice, data and, even, video information of the office would somehow be brought together into some profound new productivity that would justify the massive investment needed both to create and then purchase and use these new products and services. Central to making the vision a reality was what technology would switch data flowing between the information appliances such as computers, terminals and peripherals, telephones, and the yet-to-be-invented. The two key candidates were shaping up to be the traditional voice PBX or the just emerging LANs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PBX, first introduced in 1879, seemed the most obvious choice.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; The PBX is an on-premises telephone exchange, or switch, that enables a large number of local telephones to interconnect to each other without involving an outside telephone service provider such as AT&amp;amp;T. (See Exhibit 10.5.1 The PBX.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1051-the-pbx&quot;&gt;Exhibit 10.5.1 The PBX&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-10.5.1_PBX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of a PBX&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical wires, generally “twisted-pair,” run from a PBX to every desktop telephone, wiring already in place to handle any needed data needs, or at least that what the PBX manufacturers wanted themselves and the world to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1980 the annual sales of PBXs totaled $2.65 billion. AT&amp;amp;T dominated the market with a 45% market share, down drastically from its 100% share in 1968. The same Carterfone decision that had freed foreign attachments from the monopolistic control of AT&amp;amp;T made market competition possible in PBXs. While other firms entered the market, at first they did little but incrementally improve on the well-known PBX architecture of AT&amp;amp;T. A major transition occurred in 1976, when a new entrant, Rolm, introduced the first computer-based PBX, or CBX. While offering many improvements, it remained essentially a cross-point switch with analog links to the telephones. In 1978, Northern Telecom, a major corporation, not a struggling small firm like Rolm, introduced a CBX, the SL-1. The significant advantages of the CBX began taking their toll and in 1980, 22% of all PBX’s sold were CBXs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet AT&amp;amp;T could not sell a CBX. In 1977, the FCC thwarted even their efforts to introduce computer-like features in their Dimension PBX, believing it was enforcing Computer Inquiry I. In 1980, Computer Inquiry II made it clear AT&amp;amp;T could not sell products with imbedded information technology, unless they did so through a separate subsidiary. AT&amp;amp;T began creating a subsidiary; to be named American Bell, while they continued to fight for their right to maintain their monopoly in telecommunications as well as compete in unregulated markets - read computers. Lawyers argued that a separate subsidiary denied them the use of their significant economic resources that was not in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T delayed, others entered the seemingly lucrative CBX market, believing that all new sales of PBXs would be CBXs, the entire installed base of over $10 billion would convert to CBXs, and the coming need to interconnect computer equipment would be best met with CBXs. In 1981, AT&amp;amp;T’s market share had dropped to 38%.

The ISX was not only a CBX but could connect to Datapoint’s proprietary Arcnet LAN. It foreshadowed a new fourth generation of PBXs, ones merging the features of CBXs and LANs. The opportunity was not lost on venture capitalists. In 1981 a number of venture capital funded companies were formed, the three most famous being CXC Corporation, Ztel and Prolink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1981-1982, the trade press ran numerous articles weighing the advantages of the CBX vs. the LAN for interconnecting voice and data communication needs. [3] Experts could be found on both sides of the argument with no one really knowing the answer; CBX firms were just introducing limited data support and LAN firms were embroiled in arguments over which technology was best, let alone which had proven able to handle both data and voice communications. And then there were the growing chorus of voices extolling the benefits of integrating CBXs and LANs.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Other histories will reconstruct the decisions and actions within IBM leading up to and following early 1980 when executives realized IBM needed to sell a personal computer. Their customers were asking about them and clearly planning to buy desktop computers, if only for spreadsheet use. Competitors were entering the market like Xerox that had introduced a Z-80-based Xerox 820. IBM executives also had heard the rumors about Xerox’s Alto and were shocked to see television advertisements extolling the promises of their Star computer. Then there was Exxon buying up companies, such as Zilog and InterCom, to make an assault on the office market. The demand for personal computers was growing rapidly: witness Apple’s anticipated IPO in December, 1980. The Corporate Management Committee (CMC) and President John Opel assigned William Lowe the task of recommending a course of action. In July 1980 he reported:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only way we can get into the personal computer business is to go out and buy part of a computer company, or buy both the CPU and software from people like Apple or Atari – because we can’t do this within the culture of IBM.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurring, but strongly preferring to sell their own computer, not one of another manufacturer, Lowe and a dozen engineers he assembled were given a month to come up with a prototype design. They first contacted a number of potential suppliers and decided to use the Intel 8088 over the Motorola and Zilog microprocessors, and Microsoft’s operating system over that of Digital Research’s. They also made the PC open just as had Apple. IBM entered the personal computer business leveraging external economies rather than doing everything internally as had done successfully with the System/360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then that fall of 1980, IBM executives saw Xerox television ads on Monday Night Football announcing the benefits of its new computer system, the Star System 8000, interconnected with an Ethernet LAN. They wanted to know what IBM’s response would be. They drew a blank. So another task force was organized just as had been done to strategize for the personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Warmenhoven, a task force member, remembers why IBM selected token ring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember the meeting well. One of the recommendations was we just adopt Ethernet. And the answer came back ‘We can’t do that, because you can’t be an industry leader by following somebody else’s implementation.’  And at the time it was already pretty clear that DEC was getting very closely aligned – it wouldn’t be so bad if it was Xerox only, but having DEC in the fray, that was like a declaration of war. I mean, the Axis Powers had formed, and IBM had to have a different solution, so the alternative was to pick the token ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM task force was to learn its Zurich laboratory had been working with token ring technology ever since 1977.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; MIT Professor Jerry Saltzer, who we have observed was very familiar with token ring, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I spent the year of ‘77, ‘78 working for IBM. I was working in White Plains, but I traveled a bit, quite a bit, and one of my stops was in Zurich, and I discovered that they were interested in token rings there, so we proceeded to compare notes, and I basically supplied them with every piece of input that we had learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to why IBM selected token ring versus getting involved with Ethernet, Saltzer opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that the Zurich laboratory was trying to figure out could it do something useful in the area of local area network communications. Ethernet basically was something that was being done 5,000 miles farther away than a token ring, or a ring of any kind. They came across the Cambridge Ring almost immediately because they see lots of people from Cambridge. It was harder to look at the Ethernet because no one had published anything on it yet. You know, you would just hear, in conferences or you would hear in various places that the people at Xerox PARC, and Xerox PARC is a competing company, you can’t get inside to look at it. They hadn’t published anything on it yet, so they began looking at rings, and that’s probably the reason. I don’t remember any specific reason given. On the other hand, what I found when I got there was that they agreed with me, that if you were to start off with a completely free slate, no history behind you of any kind, and ask yourself which is intrinsically better, the Ethernet or the token ring, I believe the answer is the token ring. And I think that because they happened to have begun working in that area, they quickly came to that same conclusion themselves, that it’s got some fundamentally superior properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmenhoven remembers those three months of October to the end of the year when the token ring plan, a resource definition in the terminology of the day, had to be completed so funding of the project could begin in 1981. Warmenhoven, who reported to Murray Bolt, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Murray and I were probably the key architects of what I would consider to be three fundamental elements in this thing. The first one is that it had to be a structured system, so even though it was a ring, it was going to be a star wired system. It was going to model the phone systems. It started off with passive concentrators, but the whole cabling system and everything was kind of a star. The second one was that it would not be single ring, it would be a full mesh, and it would be strictly peer-to-peer across the mesh. Now, at the time, SNA was mainframe polled, and so here’s your first anathema at IBM, that it’s not mainframe centered. It is totally distributed. The third element, and this is really an interesting wrinkle, it had to be available for non-IBM device attachment, and this was another anathema at IBM. This leads to the conclusion you want the chip set available in the semiconductor merchant market. Murray, basically, I think, more than anybody else, made the decision that he was going to get the chip set designed by one of the major semiconductor manufacturers. The three big candidates were Intel, Motorola and TI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task force members were aware of the PC plan now in progress and that Don Estridge of the Entry Systems Division (ESD) had responsibility for the PC project. Again, Warmenhoven:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the organization had formed and we knew it was off and running, but we all kept thinking it’s going to be smart workstations and minis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 12, 1981, IBM introduced their IBM PC. It is a moment of historic importance. IBM had not introduced the first personal computer. In fact, they were reacting to the fear of being late again as they had with minicomputers.  From the IBM press release of that day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the computer for just about everyone who has ever wanted a personal system at the office, on the university campus or at home,” said C. B. Rogers, Jr. IBM vice president and group executive, General Business Group. “We believe its performance, reliability and ease of use make it the most advanced, affordable personal computer in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No expletives sounding a new day. No grand vision of the future. Simply another routine press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM PC may have been state-of–the art for the times, but most importantly it bore the imprint, and approval, of IBM. It became possible for the personal computer to be adopted within major corporations, most of which had up to then organized their MIS, i.e. computing, assets in essentially one or a few locations. The minicomputer had penetrated only the periphery of large organizations, such as branch, or division, operations. So the idea of computers on desktops seemed, well impossible, to understand. Yet in a few years, the very idea of IBM’s long-standing vision of Host centric computing would come under question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The token ring that would be the LAN to counter the marketing efforts of companies selling competitive LANs was not as easy to accomplish as was the PC: it required coordinating and working with many different interest groups within IBM to secure their agreement to make a token ring available. As for the efforts to select a merchant chip manufacturer, by year-end 1981, after nearly a year of investigation, IBM decided to work with Texas Instruments (TI). Nearly another year was then spent negotiating the design of the chip(s). On September 16, 1982, IBM and TI made known their intentions to develop integrated-circuit chips for an IBM “local area network.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; The article further confirmed that IBM was using the “token-passing” technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmenhoven remembers a meeting with TI managers shortly after the public announcement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I recall it, the contract got signed in roughly the first of December of ‘82. Now, I remember the meeting. TI came in probably ten days after the contract was signed, and said they were off the schedule by a year. I mean, they may have started the discussion ‘We’re off by up to six months,’ but by the time you get into it, it’s off by a year. And, from their perspective, they felt as though the specs had changed, all kinds of other things had gone on, but from our perspective, we had signed a contract ten days ago – I’m not sure it was exactly ten, but some very short period ago – and all of a sudden you realize that the dates you committed to, within less than a full moon, are off by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Token ring was suddenly looking like a 1984 product not a 1983 product, a prospect that did not look acceptable to ESD’s Estridge.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Bob Metcalfe fully grasped the importance of the IBM PC. Nevertheless, he and Bill Krause were committed to their plans to reduce the cost of their Ethernet controller boards: yet he couldn’t resist defocusing their efforts for a few days by dangling out the possibility of building an Ethernet controller for the IBM PC. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The credit Bob should get here is that he went out and bought an IBM PC and he brought the IBM PC and set it up in the middle of the design lab, and just set it there. And Ron Crane started pouring all over this thing and, before you knew, we understood everything we needed to know. We knew what the power slot budget was, we knew the physical size, we knew the chip count that we had to get to meet the power budget. So we began learning a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tempting as the IBM PC was, Krause kept the company focused on the plan to build a Multibus board and reduce the costs so that a PC Ethernet controller might be possible. At the time, the cost of an Ethernet controller was almost as much as a PC itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyeing the future, Metcalfe and Krause saw they needed more money. So they began talking to venture capitalists. In one of their conversations, another fortuitous connection happened, not an uncommon event when talking to venture capitalists eager to demonstrate the value they could bring as an investor. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we’re doing this next second round and Pierre Lamond, who was affiliated with Sequoia Capital, was investigating doing the round and said: ‘Hey, we know this company that’s just getting started that has a lot of technology and we heard that they were looking at using the technology to do an Ethernet chip,’ and it was Seeq. So they introduced me to Gordy Campbell the founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the end of the year, 3Com and Seeq Technology Inc. began joint development of an Ethernet chip; reason for more optimism and money. In January 1982, 3Com closed a second round of financing totaling just over $2 million. That same month Interlan would introduce their products, products directly competitive with 3Com’s controllers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 1982, management began a series of planning meetings that would culminate in a new product direction for the company. Two former Hewlett-Packard employees brought in by Krause, Lazar (Larry) Birenbaum and Larry Hardke, conceived the EtherSeries strategy - clearly derived from the guiding vision of Metcalfe and the technology in place or under development. EtherSeries was to be introduced in October of that year and would consist of two elements: Etherlink and EtherShare. Etherlink was a board-level Ethernet controller that would fit into an IBM PC and made possible sharing of files between hard disks (storage) and sharing a printer. EtherShare was a file server supporting up to 20 IBM PCs and offered 10 Megabytes of storage. (See Exhibit 8.2 3Com EtherSeries Products.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1071-3com-etherseries&quot;&gt;Exhibit 10.7.1 3Com EtherSeries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-10.7.1_3COM_Ether_Series.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of 3COM Ether Series&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having the cash to finance continued development of its existing Multibus and Unibus controllers as well as EtherSeries, the choice was made to divert all funds to EtherSeries. The controllers would be sold for as long as there were profitable customers. Management knew they were making a bet “the ranch” decision.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.8/Ungermann-Bass/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Even though they had just introduced their 10 megabits per second Ethernet with fully compliant XNS in July 1981, management still felt at risk: they did not have a confirmed semiconductor chip strategy in place. They were certain they did not want to use the announced Intel chip. Conversations with management of the start-up, Silicon Compilers, had been encouraging, but they had not heard back from them in weeks. Then Charlie Bass remembers when Silicon Compiler personnel came back after working with Seeq, another startup and the desired semiconductor foundry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They came back, and we had some fundamental differences on the concept of the design. It had to do with FIFOs and caching and engineering stuff, but it was losing some of the architectural advantages and characteristics that we wanted to see, and we could see that it wasn’t going to be much better than Intel and we weren’t going to be able to use it as much, and so we said:  “No, we don’t like this. This isn’t good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They thought the issue closed. Only to be surprised. Bass remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well they went quiet, we didn’t hear much, and then one day we hear through the rumor mills that they are working a deal with 3Com to build this chip, and in fact, there was a press release – a collaboration between Seeq and 3Com and Silicon Compilers. Well, we hit the roof. We called Kleiner Perkins and said: “Wait a minute. You can’t do that. We gave you everything we know, and now we’re hearing that one of our chief competitors is getting the PR and the advantage of working on this deal.”  So we had this summit meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kleiner Perkins resolved the matter by giving UB $500,000 with UB relinquished any intellectual property claims. The experience left management even more certain they needed a chip solution. Bass recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had spent so much energy in this, we’re thinking: “There’s an opportunity here, building chips.” So I said: “Look, I’m going to call Ken Katashiba at Fujitsu. Those guys, they know how to build chips. They don’t know anything about what this culture is all about or what this market opportunity is about. So I got Ken to go with me to NCC, in Chicago, where Xerox was making its Ethernet announcements. And it was cold – I think it was November – and the Zilog people were all there announcing ZNet. And I’m dragging Ken around by the buttonhole introducing him to the Zilog people and showing him what Xerox is doing, and I said: “Now Ken. This is going to be something, and you guys can do something here if you’ll help us build this chip.”  Well, Ken bought it, and he had the clout, or rather the access, to Ikeda, to bankroll the whole thing. So we cut a sweet deal with Fujitsu, where they, in effect, paid all of the up front engineering costs to build that part, and we had the part before Intel finally released their part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological progress came easier than sales. Jim Jordan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first customers you were getting were typical of almost any new technology. The ones you were getting were the universities, the guys that always try the first new thing in technology. In any kind of commercial account, it was always the engineering department that bought them. In the early days of LAN you didn’t sell anything to the blue [IBM] side of the shop – nothing. It all went in the engineering side. It was always going on DEC equipment. That was one of the reasons the market didn’t take off, sooner than it could have, because IBM has the major influence in the big accounts. IBM, in the early ’80s, was resisting because they didn’t have anything, so they were telling the MIS guy: “You’re going to lose your control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tough slugging as it was, UB reported sales for 1981 of $3.8 million and a loss of just over $300 thousand. They clearly had seized early market leadership and built a head of steam. And they had cash of over $8 million to finance their aggressive vision. (They issued another round of Preferred Stock during the year for nearly $6.5 million.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1982, UB introduced a 5 megabit broadband Ethernet, a product leveraging the skills and knowledge of Gregory Hopkins and his team. Only problems completing the product delayed shipments until September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In great demand as a speaker, Ralph Ungermann remembers wanting to raise the awareness of UB within the investor community - knowing there would always be a need for more money:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our real competitors in those days were the PBX guys, right? I was on 50 conferences with Rolm: Ungermann-Bass versus Rolm. Rolm was going to be the hub of the office, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ungermann talked to the financial community, Bass gave talks to customer forums. Bass recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I spent half my life, in those days, giving seminars and tutorials all over the place on the planet to anyone who would listen, because this was the early stage of evangelical kind of business. You had to go out and convince people the stuff worked, that it made sense that it was going to be around. So I was giving one of these tutorial things to some financial symposium, and afterwards this guys walks up and says: “Would you sign my tutorial notebook?”  And I said:  “Well, why?” And he said: “Well, because there’s a woman that works with me and she’s followed your company, and this would really mean a lot to her to have your signature.”  Well, that’s the first time in my life someone had asked for my signature, other than on a check or a closing document, and I look at the guy’s badge, and it says IBM. So I said: “Now wait. You got to tell me what’s going on here. What do you mean you’ve been studying us?” Well it turns out this was a group in Raleigh that had been the classical IBM task force that had been studying the industry, trying to figure out what all this stuff meant. Well, I knew about Token Ring and I knew what was going on in Zurich, I’m thinking: “What the hell is going on here. I got to find out what this means.”  So, the first chance I got I go to Raleigh. Cold call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bass learned that IBM was going to let a contract to build a token ring to broadband bridge. What an unbelievable opportunity to expand the reach of UB’s products. There was also a human component as Bass remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m having problems with Ralph and Jordan, and beginning to feel a bit disenfranchised in the company. So I really take this on as a mission and set about writing a proposal to bid on this project, and put my heart and soul into this, and went through all the machinations and lobbying and meetings and – you know, trying to find out who’s making decisions and what’s it worth and what do they want to hear, how do you do it, and so forth and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Davidson remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were asked to put together this bid very quickly, and it was asked to have a technical component. So I wrote quite a bit of text to try and describe how we would go about building this bridging functionality, and it was written in some intimate detail. Then we produced the document, submitted our bid, flew up to Raleigh to talk with Murray Bolt and Dan Warmenhoven and others, and present to them our design. And I believe that they felt this was a good design. Probably what they felt was: “Well, here’s a good, small, fast-moving company that knows something about broadband. We like Charlie. These technical guys seem to know what they’re talking about. We’ll pick them,” My perception is that we were competing against others for this opportunity, including Sytek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of discussions on how they will deliver the token ring technology required for the project, Bass contacted another small start-up that had plenty of token ring expertise. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, what happen is, we start realizing we might win this thing, and the questions starts becoming: “How do we do it?” And it becomes a part of the rationale of going ahead with Amdax. It looked like these guys could do this. I went down on just the due diligence and figuring out what the hell we were buying, and realized this was one smart bunch of engineers, and no way in hell did we want to do what they’re doing, which is some 50 megabit Token Ring, but that background makes it ideal for them to implement what we were being awarded by IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once UB won the IBM contract they began negotiating to buy Amdax, a company known for its broadband and token ring technology.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.9/Sytek/",

Wang was great for us by the way. Wang was going out telling everybody that broadband is great and couldn’t deliver it, ok, and we let them fight Ethernet. I mean, we just said, “If you want broadband, we can deliver, here it is,” and it worked. Broadband systems, actually worked pretty well over large, campus-line networks, so while UB was specialized in department networks, Ethernet type networks, we were specializing in campus networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sytek’s growth required more capital than they had, so Pliner began the search for investors. His quest took Sytek down a different path than Ungermann-Bass and 3Com. Pliner remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We went up to raise some money for the company and we looked at venture investors and others and then General Instrument (GI) found us. A guy by the name of Lou Solomon, who I have a hell-of-a-lot of respect for, had the vision, this guy was thinking 2-3 years out ahead. He said, “You guys got the technology for us to bring data into every home and every business in the city.” So, you think local networking was an interesting market now, think about the Metropolitan-Network on cable TV. Now, remember, GI was the IBM of the cable industry, ok. So, with Lou Solomon’s vision and the kinds of things that we were looking at, I said, “Take some money from these guys and let’s go even further ahead than just local networking, let’s get into Metropolitan-Networks, because, I mean all the cable TV, and GI, was doing fantastic. So we took their investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before yearend 1982, GI invested $6 million with the right to invest more in the future to bring their ownership to 51% of Sytek.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

It would be renamed a dataPBX within a year and be positioned against LANs, the direct and most-serious competition. Initially Micom would prosper with its dataPBX. There were moments of concern at the beginning however. Norred recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There were discussions on more than one occasion, two that I can recall, where we came very close, and it was almost my recommendation, to get out of the business, to literally kill the product line, because the concentrator product line was doing so well, it had so many things going for it being a product rather than a system oriented product, and I think that every time we got to the point where we were going to kill the product, we got another order for 50 or something.  It was that kind of situation. We were getting so many orders for it that it was very tough to cut it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Frankel, head of engineering and soon to be of marketing, remembers managing the dataPBX product:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had enough channel strength and enough resources to find another layer of sales and supporting people to start making some real headway in that market, and then we really started evolving the data PBX into a much more wider capable product, distributing the access to the switch, increasing the capacity of the switch, adding data over voice facilities to the switch, and integrating statistical multiplexers and protocol converters and a whole rash of other things. The end product of all of that integration of technology was that Micom ended up becoming the leading supplier of that product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Evans, VP of Marketing and to become co-President with Norred, remembers knowing about LANs, but never having the money to do anything about them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know exactly why we didn’t develop a LAN. We had a very simple, extremely simple-minded approach to running this business, which is why we were so consistent from a profit standpoint for so many years. We had a purely top down budgeting approach in this company. What I mean by that is that for each year we put the annual operating plan together, we looked at what our sales projections were for the year. We knew that we were going to make 20% pre-tax, so that was a given. What was left was, after we applied out what we knew would be the manufacturing costs for the revenues we were planning, and we were pretty good at being able to project that – we ran a pretty tight ship from that standpoint – what was left was operating expenses, and we divided that up against a formula that I don’t think we changed from one year to the next, in terms of the percent of operating expenses that went to marketing and development and G&amp;amp;A. That’s one of the reasons again, if you look at our financials, that it was totally predictable. It’s one of the things that Wall Street loved. The way we got there, however, had some side effects. One of the side effects was that the development pot was, if you will, fixed. It was fixed in the sense that there was never any attempt to decide that strategically, we had to do certain things and, therefore, we might need more bucks in development to accomplish them, and something else might have to give, maybe even pre-tax profit. We never went through that cycle at all. It was totally pre-ordained what the development dollars were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Bill and I were both extremely conservative. We both felt the same way, that when it came to figuring out priorities from the product development standpoint, the number one priority was protecting our position. We had seen far too many companies lose a market position that they developed by getting so enamored with other areas that they allowed somebody to come up behind and take away what was rightfully theirs. We focused on protecting the high ground that we had already achieved with our number one priority. Our number two priority was adding enhancements to increase our revenue potential on the high ground. Number three was developing new products that were closely allied to the areas that we were already in, and if there were any bucks left, and there never were, going into significantly new product areas. We identified LAN as something we should really be in. Unfortunately, given the way that we ran this business, it never got funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data PBXs success may have brought problems, but it would soon represent over one-third of Micom’s sales. Who could argue with success?&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.11/Codex/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Once Codex had been integrated within Motorola, Motorola executives encouraged Codex management to begin doing strategic planning without concern for resources but to focus on how to grow into a much larger company. John Pugh, who was head of strategic planning for Codex during this period, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Motorola kept pushing you on what you’re going to be when you grow up. You can do anything you want except acquire IBM. And so we did a lot of these studies. We read all the reports that everybody else read, and the PBX and teleconferencing were going to be multi-million dollar businesses. And they were all related to telecommunications. And the LAN business was going to be a good business. We had actually spent a great deal of time and effort as a result of pressures from Motorola on the PBX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982, Art Carr was promoted to head of the newly formed Information Systems Group comprised of Codex, UDS, ESE and the recently acquired Four Phase, a computer company in California. Carr recalls his attitude towards LANs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Four Phase was such an utter disaster that in ‘82, ‘3, and ‘4. I had 400 some thousand miles a year going back and forth to Four Phase. We got a late start on LANs. That was during my time, and we got basically a no start. I think that we were all very skeptical about the LAN business. We started hearing about LANs from the Chief Executive Office of Motorola within a year of being acquired. There were a lot of magazine articles about LANs but there weren’t any LANs, and we got into a kind of a contest with them, to some extent, that had a negative connotation in it, that I was digging my heels in, saying:  “I know what I’m doing.  Get off of my ass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the pressure to get into the LAN business did not back-off, surely influenced by Motorola’s management knowing IBM was going to introduce a token ring LAN; having competed for the semiconductor contract and lost to Texas Instruments. Pugh remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You keep getting notes: “What about the LAN business? What are you guys doing in the LAN business?” What it would be was an Electronic News article of something does this or that. So these things would come down to me, and I was in strategic marketing at that time, and we’d take a look at it, and we would send them back an answer of, you know, “We’re looking at it.” So I kicked off a study within the company to say, “What is this LAN business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue-covered report came out in November 1982. Pugh remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We convinced the company that that was a good business. It was a necessary business because we were not going to be in the PBX business. We had decided that, and that we felt capturing the data at its source was going to be important to maintaining our strategic thrust outside the walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having anyone on staff with the expertise to lead their efforts, they hired an executive search firm who turned up a name too good to be true: Murray Bolt. Who better than the manager heading IBM’s token ring project? Bolt, knowing he was in the penalty box for the delays in the token ring project, jumped ship and joined Codex in December 1982.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.12/Other-Data-Communication-Competitors/",

Racal-Milgo announced a LAN based on the Cambridge Ring, a token passing network IBM had studied and passed on. It came to nothing. When Paradyne hired Jerry McDowell for networking product planning, he brought in Bob Metcalfe to consult. When McDowell left for Wang to assume responsibilities for Wangnet, any intentions within Paradyne died. Most management probably argued that they had enough to do to stay competitive in modems and multiplexers and did not have the resources to take on anything new and so technologically foreign.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.13/Interlan/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Interlan exemplified the quick-to-market advantages of a start-up. They introduced their first Ethernet boards in January 1982, just six months after incorporation. They soon discovered that their products were slower than the Ethernet boards of 3Com as a result of using the Zilog Z-80 microprocessor. Paul Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happened to us is when we found that the Z‑80 didn’t go as fast as we wanted it to, and we didn’t have a lot of time to figure that out because we were so fast getting to market, that there was a little hiatus there where 3‑Com gained some ground. Our board was slower until we changed it tow a bit slice [microprocessor] in July. Then we really had them sort of on the run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interlan didn’t initially offer any networking protocols. But in 1982 they decided on XNS, for reasons very similar to those argued within Ungermann-Bass. Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once we had the hardware out, we basically wanted to make a decision about what protocol we were going to support, and there were a choice of two, XNS or TCPIP. We were looking for protocols that had certain characteristics that were efficient, that could be made to go fast. So we picked XNS, along with Ungermann-Bass and Bridge and 3‑Com and everybody else in the field, because if you looked at the two protocols from a technical point of view, XNS was designed for Ethernet, and TCP was designed for big wide area communications systems and had lots of overhead to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interlan had a great first year. 1982 sales were $2.4 million with a loss of $1.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.14/Bridge-Communications/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;With $2 million in the bank after closing a second round financing in February 1982, Bridge Communications management had to commit to a product architecture. For a microprocessor, they had a better choice than the Zilog Z-80, the newly available 16/32 bit 68000 from Motorola. For a networking operating system, they too decided on XNS. Bill Carrico remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We did Ethernet and XNS because those were the things that were closest to being a standard. We had no interest in doing an OmniNet&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;-like thing, or anything like that. XNS, by the way, is clearly the best local area network protocol ever written, and is dramatically superior in performance to TCP/IP. We did XNS, and we did not do TCP/IP, because we knew that it had a lot of warts in a local area network situation. It was reasonably easy to sell XNS early on because at least it was in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Bridge Communications began shipping its first product: a terminal communications server. Having started its product development cycle almost two years after Ungermann-Bass, it was able to incorporate the latest technologies into its products, gaining a needed edge in their competition with the more established and larger Ungermann-Bass.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

K. started taking product in December 1981. Then in May 1982, they won a major order from the Swedish P.T.T for $2.7 million. In winning, they beating out L. M. Ericsson, Vadic,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; Siemens, and Nokia. Miller recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a big win. We beat out Vadic. There was shock at Vadic from that. Total shock! Who the hell are they? There were shock waves all over Europe with this new player out there: Concord Data Systems. We were also very fortunate at the time because Codex had a policy of going direct in many countries. They were sort of tying in with Four Phase&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; and Motorola, going with one entity, one business unit in each country. And the distributors weren’t dumb. They wanted alternative products. Plus the fact that Codex had no dial-up modems, and the only one in the Motorola family was UDS [Universal Data Systems], and UDS had never paid attention to international. So we could get signed up with Codex distributors and not have a conflict because they didn’t have any dial-up modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success in modems immediately impacted their LAN plans. Miller, wanting someone else to manage engineering, brought Ross Seider aboard as vice-president of Engineering. Only his two modem engineers rebelled. Feeling trapped by his commitments to Seider and the venture capitalists, Miller compromised and split engineering into two groups. While not the solution he preferred, his prior experience with a departmentalized structure at Codex gave him comfort the structure could work. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ross Seider, the guy from Codex, became VP of Engineering for LANs. Maybe they were a little bit prima donnas, but the two modem engineers, Northam and Kameya, didn’t want to work for Seider. So there was from the beginning a split in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seider worked in Boston, while Phinney, the expert in token bus LAN’s, worked in Phoenix. Phinney began adding staff in Phoenix, first hiring Bob Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller, meanwhile, had been working closely with the engineers at Amdax and held hopes that they would have a close corporate relationship.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

They had participated intensely in the finalization and publishing of the DIX proposed Ethernet standard on September 30, 1980.

In June 1982, as part of their Decnet Phase IV announcement, DEC announced Ethernet controller boards for delivery in 1983, with parts of the system, the transceivers, available later in 1982.

First hired to plug some of the hole left by those defecting to start Bridge Communications, by the time they had working products in middle of 1981, Rekhi remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zilog was falling apart as a company. Our CEO, Manny Fernandez, left to start his own company, and there was a person under him, Rolando Eschevera, he left to start his own company, and the person under him, Doug Schwartz, he left to start his own company. I was with a couple of people doing all these machines with all the problems of management above us missing.  So there was nobody there above us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there was nobody to sell the products: a Z-80 personal computer, the Z-Net LAN and a file server – essentially an early EtherSeries. By year-end, Rekhi too had had enough. In January 1982, Rekhi, Navindra Jain and Inder Singh founded Excelan to develop an Ethernet controller board that would be much faster than the ones being sold by 3Com and Interlan. Rekhi remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we came up with a design for all the buses – Unibus, QBus, VME Bus, Multibus, even went to the IBM PC bus and Macintosh. Our idea was a bunch of protocols on board that could go into any of those environments without having to redo the protocols, and so we were the first ones to do the intelligent Ethernet boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligent boards because they had a microprocessor fast enough to process the Ethernet protocol on the board itself; network processing did not have to be handed off to the computer. It made the board much more expensive than those of 3Com and Interlan, but for those OEMs that wanted speed and performance, Excelan carved out a new niche.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.18/Communications-Machinery-Corporation-(CMC)/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In February 1981, William F. Baxter became the new Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust for the newly elected Ronald Reagan Administration. He was a Stanford law professor, with strong ideals, and a considered view of economics and competition. On taking office his two superiors recused themselves from involvement in the AT&amp;amp;T anti-trust case for conflict of interest reasons. Baxter thus became the chief Justice Department official on the case – reporting to the White House. Baxter decided to handle the case personally and not be burdened with what had happened before him and the constraints implied. He saw the case as one of extending what the FCC had started – to separate from AT&amp;amp;T that best regulated, from that better controlled by the forces of market competition.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;  On his first meeting with the chief counsel and negotiator for AT&amp;amp;T, Howard Trienans – who had came not from within AT&amp;amp;T, but an outside law firm, and was thus somewhat similarly unencumbered by past practices - Baxter terminated past negotiations, and stated his position: AT&amp;amp;T should divest the Operating Companies and go about its business competing with the Long Lines, Bell Labs, and WE. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 3, 1981, Judge Vincent Biunno of the New Jersey District Court ruled that the FCC’s Computer Inquiry II Final Decision preventing AT&amp;amp;T from competing in unregulated markets, unless as separate subsidiaries, was a legal modification of the 1956 Consent Decree. AT&amp;amp;T immediately filed an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December, AT&amp;amp;T, motivated to a decision by Congressional activity to pass communication legislation – legislation that might be much worse than Baxter’s offer – relented. A joint press statement was released on December 31 announcing talks that might lead to the “settlement of pending litigation.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Baxter then went to work securing Administration support for the agreement; support not to be presumed. On January 8, the Justice Department and AT&amp;amp;T, Baxter and Brown, signed a decree ending the antitrust suit.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt; Then in an intricate series of legal maneuvers, the case was to be moved from the New Jersey District Court to Judge Greene’s court and the settlement would revise the 1956 Consent Decree and settle the case.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; Or it was suppose to be moved, only Judge Biunno accepted the agreement instead of referring it to Judge Greene, which meant it could be appealed and thus not final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both Houses of Congress legislation began emerging seeking to change the terms of the agreement to better assure that local telephone rates remained low and the principle of universal service remained intact. Concerned elected officials still saw long distance telephone service as a monopoly, a monopoly needing to be regulated, in part, so that subsidies could continue to flow from interstate to intrastate revenues, and thus help sustain low local rates.  The Justice Department, AT&amp;amp;T, and now an angry Judge Greene, who saw his authority abused by the New Jersey court, all wanted their agreement to be made final and not complicated by legislative action. AT&amp;amp;T began a publicity campaign inciting public protest over legislation, which proved successful, and the three parties succeeded in having court authority transferred to Judge Greene’s court. Judge Greene then inserted ten modifications, all of which were accepted, and the settlement was finalized on August 24, 1982. One of the ten amendments to the agreement was that the Bell Operating Companies could provide customer premises equipment (CPE): they just couldn’t become manufacturers. They would have to buy CPE from competitive firms, including AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dismembered AT&amp;amp;T had two parts. First, a succeeding AT&amp;amp;T, a corporation having the same name: AT&amp;amp;T, composed of Western Electric, Bell Laboratories and Long Lines. It had all of the manufacturing, most of the research and development, and the long distance telephone network.  The other part of the dismembered AT&amp;amp;T was all the local telephone companies: to be organized into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). The new AT&amp;amp;T continues to be of interest to this history. (See Exhibit 8.3 AT&amp;amp;T Reorganization January 1982).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicative of the business judgment of the day, Arthur D. Little executive Frederic G. Withington, remarked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the surface, AT&amp;amp;T appeared to give away the store. But a second, more studied look indicates that they really gained the store.

[20] Then in 1982, IBM signed a development agreement with Mitel for a CBX IBM would market. Dissatisfied with Mitel’s progress, in the summer of 1983 IBM abandoned its relationship and by then a $370 million investment. IBM next purchased 15% of Rolm for $300 million. [21] During these same years IBM reportedly spent $100 million trying to develop its own third-generation PBX. IBM appeared as intent on being in the PBX business as AT&amp;amp;T was in the computer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM’s designs to enter the LAN business had become equally complicated. Their token ring LAN was not expected to be ready until 1984 and, in fact, would slid to late 1985. The Entry Systems Division, responsible for the PC, and planning to introduce an upgraded PC in 1984, would select yet another LAN, arguing that they needed to have a LAN to compete in the marketplace. (This story will to be told in the next chapter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the confusion between PBXs and LANs, in December 1983, IBM convened yet another task force to explore whether they needed both. The conclusion must have been yes for in 1984, IBM both bought the rest of Rolm for $1.5 billion and introduced its maverick PC-LAN.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.23/3Com-1982/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year ending May 1982, 3Com’s revenues soared 250% to $1.8 million with a loss of $690 thousand. Only their burn rate - expenses needed to execute to the EtherSeries plan - will consume their roughly $2 million of cash in less than a year. The impact of Interlan’s entry had made it clear that their current products are rapidly being driven obsolete; meaning cash from sales will be harder and harder to come by. If EtherSeries is either late to market or does not sell, 3Com faced a problematic future. So ran the pending press obituaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1982, 3Com’ Board of Directors, concerned with how to grow sales even faster, approve a plan to promote L. William Krause to CEO and put Robert Metcalfe in charge of Sales and Marketing. It proved to be a brilliant move. Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We really started heading into the tank. So we made ME head of sales and marketing. So I was head of sales and marketing for two years which is my major accomplishment at 3‑Com. I mean I did a lot of other things, but THAT was the thing that I really did, was get us to a million a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get sales to $1 million a month took competence aided by the aura of an industry leader, the man who had invented Ethernet. In Metcalfe’s words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can get an appointment with anybody that I wanted to, because I was the inventor of Ethernet, and they would talk to me. So unlike a lot of other salespeople, I had an entrée anywhere I went. And I’m good at personal selling. I mean I can talk to people and I listen to them, and then I have intelligent things to say and then they want to buy my products later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1982, 3Com introduced EtherSeries: IBM PC-compatible EtherLink controllers and the EtherShare file server. The price of an EtherLink interconnecting two PCs and a shared disk drive, was $950 per computer: a price breaking the mythical $1000 per computer price point and down sharply from $3 thousand per connection just a few years earlier. (The Seeq-supplied Ethernet chip made the lower price possible.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XNS-based EtherSeries took advantage of the knowledge gained from working with XNS and TCP/IP networking protocols. They were in fact offering some of the higher-level services inherent in these networking systems such as file sharing, print sharing and a platform on which to build other user applications. These services and features reflect a user’s, especially a computer user’s, point-of-view, one very different than those of the communication community that thought in terms of physical connections and moving bits reliably over those connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EtherSeries would be a success. 3Com had skirted disaster.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/10.24/Ungermann-Bass-1982/",

The dataPBX will still be cheaper (roughly $650 per connection), but it did not enjoy the steeply declining cost curve of Ethernet, or of other network connections that could be reduce to a chip - that is software and logic becomes a chip. This advantage, when combined with the communication speed that could be supported at the connection, or device, of 10 million bits/second, not a paltry 19,200 its/second, gave Ethernet an ever-gaining edge. The dataPBX and CBX speed per connection seemed like enough in the paradigm of terminals connecting to computers, but not when the paradigm became computers to computers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; A paradigm bursting into existence with the introduction of the IBM PC, a paradigm that will revolutionize what the Information Economy will look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethernet chip will also create substantial early mover advantages since token ring chips from TI would not be available for an estimated two years; two years that will become four years. Token bus, a broadband design, required the use of RF modems, not the simple transceiver of Ethernet, and modems will preclude token bus from ever becoming a chip in time. So Ethernet vendors were about to seize a huge market advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for LANs was projected to become a $1 billion somewhere between 1986 and 1990; depending upon whose forecast you believed; this up from a market, ranging between $50 and $100 million in 1982.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; The more optimistic forecast proved correct, implying a growth rate between 70-110% per year. An extraordinary growth rate that would propel those firms with established presence into real companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the firms selling local area networks, especially Ethernet products, the lofty market estimates might have made raising money easier, but in the short-term it invited unmitigated competition. In 1982, estimates of the number of firms with announced products ranged as high as 200. There would be 60 Ethernet vendors by 1984.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; In addition to the sheer number of competitors, there were the complications of competing against the lumbering CBX and PBX vendors, the promises of the integrated CBX-LAN vendors, the dataPBX firms and dozens of proprietary local area networks extolling their special advantages. The endless debates of what were better baseband (i.e., Ethernet) or broadband (i.e., token bus) added yet another layer of confusion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; In sum: chaos.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;1981-1982 witnessed the early uncertainties and confusion of a forming market. Given sufficient economic potential in a perceived market, a large number of firms, both existing and new, will attempt to compete successfully for market share. In Networking, up to 200 firms announced products. In another common feature of emerging markets, the largest of firms often have the most difficulty competing. AT&amp;amp;T once meant communications and was on their way to becoming an also ran. AT&amp;amp;T was willing to disband to have the freedom to compete in the computer market, and they will, and they will fail. IBM had unsuspectingly introduced creative destruction with their PC, and yet had a hard time making sense of it. They got into the PBX business, and will get out in the future. They shadowboxed the LAN market into early paralysis, contributing more than their share to mass confusion. Or as DataPro, a respected research firm, wrote in December 1982:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;indented&quot;&gt;Local area networking is one of the hottest topics on today's communications market. At exhibitions, conferences, and seminars, in trade magazines, newspapers, and newsletters, over lunch and at meetings, LAN has been the talk of the town. As a commercial offering, LAN is still so much in its infancy that no one yet knows all the questions. Let alone having all the answers.The marketplace itself has not yet jelled. No vendor involved in data processing, office automation, or communications wants to be left out, and every vendor seems to have a different solution to the LAN &quot;problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder customers were reluctant to do more than experiment until the plethora of choices made buying more certain: that even if their vendor did not survive, and who could pick the winner, the technology would not be obsolete but could be continued to be used and improved upon. Given the wide assortment of alternatives, it was not clear the best design would emerge from the unknowable market competition. So customers, particularly government agencies and universities, motivated the creation of standards making bodies to come to impartial recommendations. The making of standards is common to communications, whether it is languages or protocols, and the same would be true for Networking - the story of the next chapter. The following chapter picks up where this chapter ends, and takes it to 1986 when the market becomes orderly and some of the firms in this chapter come to dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-10271-networking-sales-1981-1982--thousands&quot;&gt;Exhibit 10.27.1 Networking Sales 1981-1982 ($ Thousands)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;This chapter returns to 1979 and reconstructs a co-evolving history to that of Networking: the emergence of computer communication standards. As observed in Chapter 8, by 1982, market forces led to an overwhelming number of networking alternatives; confusion that kept buyers from acting and the market from growing. Without buying demand, most Networking company’s fortunes would suffer and the needs of customers to interconnect their growing base of computers and peripherals would face numbing uncertainty. The events of this chapter up through 1982 were known, or could have been known, to the entrepreneurs and engineers of Networking in the story as told so far. The events of 1983-1984 were certainly anticipated by industry participants, although with varying degrees of success. The actual impact on the companies of Networking will be reconstructed in Chapter 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980’s, both the huge market potential for Networking (LANs) as well as the existing state of confusion were well understood. In December 1980, a respected market research firm issued a report forecasting LAN sales to grow from essentially zero to $3.2 billion by 1990.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; A year later, the Economist magazine summarized the state of affairs in Networking as “a technological jungle in which experts violently disagree and potential buyers stand aghast.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Could technological order emerge from this chaos?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An historical alternative to market competition when deciding communication technology outcomes exists. Create a standard. A source of authority, such as an institutional agency or a professional association, rules which technology is best, and then has the means to enforce or consolidate standard compliance. However, to be observed, the coming-into-being of the social structures needed to create and administrate standards can be every bit as challenging as the founding of new companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories of five important standards-making efforts will be told from their beginnings to technological order in 1984. They include a company trying to enforce its market power (XNS), or work in cooperation with other companies to enforce market power (DIX); governments trying to dictate standards (TCP/IP), or agreeing to standards (OSI); and users reaching mutual agreement (IEEE 802). By 1984, these interacting efforts settled the questions of LAN standards and an explosion in LAN sales began. The seemingly settled history of LAN protocols holds a surprising twist, however. A story told in future chapters.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;While most of the history observed in this reconstruction focuses on the emergence of new markets pioneered by new firms, market order does not always coalesce when their exist many new technologies to solve similar problems. The use of institutions to solve such impasses often proves successful. This chapter recounts the histories of how standards were created to bring market order to local area networking and begin a period of explosive growth for Networking. The social entrepreneurs responsible for the creation of new standards-making institutions faced more political than economic challenges. To be successful meant securing the backing of existing authority structures and then leading frequently hostile parties to collective decisions. The two efforts examined most closely are those of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Committee 802 and the International Standards Organization Technical Committee (ISO/TC) 97 Subcommittee 16. The former is a United States organization and the latter an international one; albeit both were closely observed and influenced by individuals and organizations regardless of country of origin (See Exhibit 9.0 Standards Organizations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1111-standards-organizations&quot;&gt;Exhibit 11.1.1 Standards Organizations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-11.1.1_Standards_Organizations.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Standards Organizations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the ever-growing expectation of standards resolution, organizations enhanced or changed their technologies to conform to perceived outcomes. They were not always right. And sometimes being right had more to do with politics than technological superiority. In the end, the guiding architecture will be the Open System Interconnection Reference Model approved as a Working Draft by the ISO in late 1979. Based on layers and stacks, it represents a cumulative effort dating to the design of operating systems and the experiences with Arpanet (See Exhibit 9.1 Layers and Stacks).

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;After co-chairing the Local Area Communications Network Symposium in May 1979, an energized Robert Rosenthal returned to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and began organizing an effort to develop Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for local area networking. Proving innovation and creativity know no bounds, the NBS pursued a novel approach to formulating standards, one to have significant implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were trying to position ourselves to develop standards in the voluntary community that we could adopt for use in the government. This is an important concept. We said: ‘This is our approach. We want to work with industry in a voluntary arena to get industry backing for products so that we can buy those products. There was a fundamental difference between that way of doing business and the way the Department of Defense wants to do business. The Department of Defense, at the time, would throw money at a problem until it got solved. Vint Cerf and company went off to invent TCP at the time because they got lots of DOD money to make networks work. We said: ‘Fine, you do whatever you need to do, but our approach is to work with industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon thereafter, Rosenthal, in his capacity as Chairman of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Technical Committee of Computer Communications (TCCC), learned of an effort underway to form a group under its microprocessor technical committee to study data highways. (Data highway was another expression for LANs; an expression used in process control for the electrical connections between process control sensors and monitoring equipment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problems of interconnecting computer equipment were not unique to the office. Similar needs existed on the factory floor or in the interconnection of instrumentation equipment. Maris Graube, who will become a leader in the evolution of LAN standards, started out oblivious to LAN developments, either for the office or factory. Graube remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had never read anything about LAN’s. I knew nothing about data communications, zero, zip, I mean absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Graube, an engineer, joined Tektronix Inc., Portland, OR, not for professional reasons, but because he wanted to live in Oregon. After having been turned down twice for jobs by Tektronix, a friend told him of their need for someone to look into what they should be doing with the new IEEE 488 instrumentation interface standard. Hewlett Packard (HP), their major competitor, had introduced equipment using the standard and Tektronix management feared a competitive disadvantage. Although it was a job “no one else wanted,” Graube leaped at the opportunity and moved to Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converting to the 488 standard proved imperative and Graube led its introduction and diffusion throughout Tektronix’s products. His interest and motivations captured, he began attending meetings – then to formulate “codes and formats,” not standards. Focus centered on higher-layer protocols - formats – that would impose information onto the data transmitted - codes. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that there were some severe limitations to the 488 interface specification. The distance can only be 20 meters between instruments. If you needed to automate the larger laboratory, this was not appropriate. And various techniques for extending the distance of that particular technology were inadequate. So I was thinking:  “Gee, there must be something that has a little bit longer length to it that operates in the megabit per second kind of data rate.” You don’t need to go extremely fast. I didn’t know exactly what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a casual conversation with a magazine writer, Graube learned Professor Ted Williams at Purdue University led an Industrial Process Control Workshop. Again Graube got involved, even chairing the group for a couple of years, before concluding their “PROWAY” (Process Control Data Highway) inadequate for a laboratory setting. Again his curiosity, and need to make a job of what no-one-else-wanted to do, caused him to ruminate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I thought: ‘Gee, it would be nice to have a standards committee for something that was more applicable towards computer instrumentation and more of a commercial environment.’ So I started poking around to see if anyone else was doing anything like that in standards bodies, and found out no one was. In 1979, I ran across Bob Stuart, who was with the IEEE, and he had been very instrumental in starting up many standards efforts for microprocessors within IEEE. He said: ‘Well, why don’t you just form a little standards group under the microprocessor standards umbrella.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know anything about how one goes about starting standards or about getting project authorizations or anything, so he helped me a little bit and told me about what to do and what forms to fill out – I still didn’t know what a local area network was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help, Graube submitted a proposal to the IEEE Standards Board to create a local-network standard for laboratory and office settings. After checking to make sure no other such standard effort was underway, the IEEE Standards Board authorized Standards Project 802 in October 1979, under the sponsoring organization of Rosenthal’s TCCC, not the microprocessor group.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Graube, the appointed chairman, needed next to form a technical committee to formulate the standard. Members of Committee 802, as it would come to be known, had to be members of the IEEE and could not represent the interests of any organization – even their employers – and had to volunteer their efforts. The goal: a draft standard with the support of three quarters of those participating in its creation. Rosenthal remembers that moment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Everything was in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube scheduled the first Committee 802 meeting for February 28, 1980, concurrent with the spring meeting of CompCon. (Since member’s participated voluntarily, meetings were generally held in conjunction with trade shows or other technical meetings.) Uncertain of how many people might attend the mandated open meeting, Graube arranged for a small meeting room at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco. To his, and everyone else’s, surprise, the crowd, estimated at as many as 150, overflowed into the hallway and delayed the start of the meeting, adding yet more confusion to a still-forming process. Many were simply curious engineers preferring to join their own rather than a night out sightseeing. Others, like Robert Metcalfe and John Shoch, had vested interests, and still others, like the “droves”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; of Bell Labs engineers, came out of habit. When the meeting finally began, Rosenthal recalls with awe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All we had was Maris to stand up and organize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help from others more experienced, Graube weathered the melee and established the goal of one standard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;roughly a megabit per second and a kilometer long and connect some 100 devices or so, and be made for the commercial environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before adjourning, Rosenthal proposed their work conform to the recently published OSI Reference Model.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; After affirming the proposal, the next meeting was set for May 27th-31st, 1980, at NBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As chairman, Graube wielded significant influence and authority both to transform his vision into the standard as well as to structure the needed subcommittees. In both regards he relied heavily on his PROWAY experiences. For example, he wanted to follow the PROWAY approach of first establishing the functional requirements for the standard and avoid the parade of companies lobbying for their products to be declared the standard. Once the functional requirements had been agreed to, however, Graube wanted to proceed differently from PROWAY which had become mired in the process of evaluating whether a given company’s product best fit the standard. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the end they thought that there would be one product that was more outstanding than the others, and that would be selected as the standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube recognized that no vendor would vote for a competitor’s product and so a standard was unlikely to emerge. Instead, Graube wanted to create the standard and then let companies build products to conform to it  – non-proprietary products that would benefit from open competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Graube’s clear view of how to proceed, he underestimated the number of technological alternatives that existed, the economic stakes at risk and the efforts corporations would make to influence Committee 802. Rosenthal sensed the inherent friction of interests represented by those attending that first meeting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You could feel fire in the air!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as Graube wanted to preclude corporations from unduly influencing the dynamics of standards making, he was not to have his way.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Over the summer of 1979, Metcalfe continued to shepherd the possibility of three-way cooperation among Xerox, DEC, and Intel to commercialize Ethernet. Finally, that fall, the three firms met at the Boxborough Sheraton, Boxborough, MA. Acknowledging Metcalfe’s essential role, they invited him to the pre-meeting dinner. The following day the technical teams of the three companies met without marketing people or Metcalfe. Slighted not in the least, Metcalfe turned his attention to how his fledgling 3Com could fund building products that would conform to the technical specifications he expected DEC, Intel and Xerox (DIX) to negotiate and then publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid antitrust legal complications, the DIX members had to agree to place the results of their collaboration in the public domain for the purpose of creating a standard. On the surface, the formation of Project IEEE 802 would have seemed an ideal means to make Ethernet a standard; if not the standard. However Graube’s bias against any corporation usurping the authority of Comittee 802 set the two efforts on a collision course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreeing to cooperate did not mean that the DIX members shared a common view of what the Ethernet standard should be. In fact, their differences often gave rise to tensions straining the collaboration to the breaking point. But each time, the strength of their collective commitment to the commercial opportunities of local area networking prevailed and they resolved their differences. (The description and lexicon of Ethernet at the time is seen in Exhibit 11.3.1 Ethernet Model.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1131-ethernet-model&quot;&gt;Exhibit 11.3.1 Ethernet Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-11.3.1_Ethernet_Model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Ethernet Model&quot; title=&quot;diagram of Ethernet Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each company’s technical team came with their own prejudices, competencies, and requirements. Kaufman of Intel remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issues really were cabling and controller chips. There was no problem in making the chips run at 10 megahertz, and there were lots of issues about cabling, and I think what pushed up the cost most, in the early years, was Xerox and DEC’s insistence of having coax, because they were interested in all the very real problems of installing this stuff and making it work and making it reliable. Whereas the rest of us were much more hackers, we were willing to pull anything if it would work. There were debates about could anybody build a transceiver that would really work at any speed reliably despite the existence proof of what had been running at PARC. This was a black art by one guy in a closet, and a lot of theoretical work was spent by people on ‘What should a transceiver do and could it work?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddle of Xerox, on the other hand, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We thought that the Xerox design was conservative and then those guys jacked it further up, but that was all right, because they wanted it to be reliable. So it was a very tight piece of engineering that was done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While work progressed, the central issue of transferring proprietary, patented, technology from Xerox to DEC and INTEL remained unsolved. Xerox had flourished controlling its technology. From the beginning, Xerox’s desires to keep PARC’s innovations secret suggested Xerox might not agree to license Ethernet. Nevertheless, work progressed under the leadership of Liddle, Kaufman and Dave Rodgers of DEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After intense negotiations, the three companies decided to execute two agreements: one between Xerox and DEC and the other between Xerox and Intel. There would be no three-way agreement, although the two agreements were linked by conditions. Liddle recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All three parties had to agree to implement this product as a standard for their future products. It didn’t have to be their only network they used, but they all had to agree to implement it and support it. Xerox proposed to license, for one thousand dollars each, the Ethernet technology and to reserve for them a block of addresses and so forth. Intel had to agree to manufacture an integrated circuit chip set to implement the protocols and control. Digital had to agree to design and manufacture a low-cost transceiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddle then faced the challenge of securing the agreement of Xerox. The strength of his argument rested in his belief that it was in the best interests of Xerox to license the technology and that DEC and Intel were ideal organizations to partner with. Fortunately, Peter McCullough, the President, believed Xerox should creatively use its technology to acquire technology and commitments from others. When Liddle made his presentation to McCullough, he remembers McCullough quickly saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What a great idea. Trading the rights to this patent for improvements and all that, and their commitment to make parts, and then use it as a standard. What a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, word of DIX had spread. Other companies wanted to participate. Yet more participants might complicate the process more than help. Gordon Bell of DEC remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got calls from a bunch of places wanting to be part of the design team. Intel was pressuring me. Intel sent Olivetti after me, and I talked to somebody at Olivetti and he said: ‘We want to be part of that.’ I said: ‘No way. We’ve got eight of the best people I know designing it now. Any more people will hurt it. We’ve got plenty of people inside of DEC that would like to be part of it. I’m sure Intel’s got a lot of people. Xerox could probably drum up people. This thing is going so well. Let’s not mess it up. You can comment once its available.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman, on the other hand, sought to stimulate as much support as possible. Intel wanted ready customers for its new chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We worked, trying to influence a lot of other companies, because for us, the whole goal was, besides some altruistic one about making communications work and advancing the state of the art, to generate customers who were ready for the chips we were going to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the prized potential customers for Intel was Hewlett Packard (HP). Every couple of months Kaufman would have lunch with Dave Crocket, head of strategy and planning for HP. In addition to bemoaning the difficulties of trying to make strategies in their organizations, they discussed technological developments including networking. HP had multiple networking standards being developed and Crocket believed that the groups would be more likely to support an external standard than to trade their own standard for another group’s. He pushed Ethernet as the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel also wanted to make the Ethernet chip as complex as possible. Kaufman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We drove the Ethernet controller chip to make it a tremendously complex chip that did a lot of work, because that was Intel’s advantage. If we could set the high-water mark that everybody else had to come up to have a viable controller, there would be something that we did best, we’d take advantage of our ability. So, that first chip really was a whole computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing against adding more participants and making a more complex Ethernet chip was the risk of being left at the altar by the authority of Committee 802 to define a standard. With the DIX collaboration still far from agreement among themselves, their concern turned to the upcoming Committee 802 meeting and fears that momentum might build for an alternative technology. To forestall precipitous action by Committee 802, they decided to announce just prior to the May meeting that they would publish their standard in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddle remembers hammering out the press release to have been “harder to accomplish than the original contract.”&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/11.4/IEEE-Committee-802-and-DIX-1980-1981/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;At the May IEEE Committee 802 meeting, DIX supplemented the press release with a two-page description of Ethernet with the message:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonable approach to creating a local area network and if the committee wants to consider it, we’d be willing to work with them. If they don’t want to consider it, we’re going to do it anyway, but we’d still be willing to participate.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition immediately decried DIX’s heavy-handed tactics of undermining the goal of standards-making independent of corporate influence. DIX also received public support, such as from Greg Hopkins, chairman of IFIP, which like the IEEE had created a working group or committee to develop a LAN standard. Quoted in Data Communications in June 1980, Hopkins opined:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a significant announcement because of the sheer size of the companies involved and is a step toward the integrated office of the future.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube did not welcome DIX’s actions. If Ethernet became a de facto standard outside the IEEE 802 process, it might undermine the authority and legitimacy of Committee 802 to create a successful standard. As much as he frowned on DIX-type efforts, neither did he want DIX to act independently of Committee 802. From that same Data Communications article of June 1980, Graube urged cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other companies may have other opinions, and Xerox may not be able to satisfy everyone’s needs………..The U.S. is no longer alone as the technological leader, so we will have to comply with international standards – just because the U.S. has a de facto standard does not mean that it will be accepted overseas.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this swirling background intrigue, the agenda of the May meeting to organize a committee structure to begin standardization efforts resulted in three subcommittees: the Physical Level, Link Level and High-Level Interface subcommittees. Substituting layer for level, they conform to the following diagram. (See Exhibit 9.3 IEEE LAN Architecture.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1141-ieee-lan-architecture&quot;&gt;Exhibit 11.4.1 IEEE LAN Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-11.4.1_IEEE_LAN_Architecture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of IEEE LAN Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Physical Level subcommittee chaired by Jerry Clancy (of Honeywell) intended to create the functional specifications for the physical media and how to signal over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Link Level subcommittee chaired by Nathan Tobol (Codex)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; would define the protocol imposed on the Physical Level signals – whether polled or token passing for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More open-ended was the High-Level Interface subcommittee chaired by Allen Rochkind (Spectra Physics). Graube remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I thought there would be a group that would look into the interfacing issues. At that time, interface to me meant a hardware interface – how does a chip, a semiconductor part, interact with a microprocessor. That’s the interface I thought about. As it turned out, it’s more of a logical interface than a hardware one, and we have very little to say about how the microprocessors work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube recalls the hectic pace to become a hallmark of Committee 802:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We basically started out with great enthusiasm. There were many meetings held. I think we held a meeting every two months or so, and they grew very quickly from three-day meetings to full-week meetings, and a lot of times we’d start on Sunday and work all through the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the June Physical Level subcommittee meeting, held in tandem with a PROWAY meeting, many PROWAY members switched the focus of their efforts to IEEE 802. In another effort to speed committee work, a further subcommittee, the Media Access Group, was formed and scheduled a meeting for September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the September meeting of the Media Access Group, held at Gould-Modicom in North Andover, MA, the discussions turned decidedly more technical. So far, those attending Committee 802 meetings had been shadow boxing with four camps of technological interest. The first camp was, DIX and its Ethernet, or CSMA/CD, technology. The second camp consisted of the much more loosely organized PROWAY advocates who favored a token technology of some kind. The computer giant IBM constituted the third camp, rumored to favor token ring, but unwilling to make clear their intentions! Their dominant market position seemingly gave them the opportunity to set a de facto standard. IBM’s indecision invaded every conversation like a black cloud. Could Committee 802 act without IBM revealing its LAN? The fourth, the chaotic camp, grew weekly as firms announced proprietary LAN solutions of every kind. Graube’s goal of one standard grew doubtful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding pith to the September meeting, Mike Kryskow, of Gould-Modicom, presented a paper on a token bus protocol he had created. The contrast between a deterministic token network and the probabilistic CSMA/CD caused many to question whether CSMA/CD could be the standard. A token standard gained momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 30, DIX released their Ethernet specification as promised. Known as the “Blue Book” by the color of its cover, Kaufman remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some 25,000 copies were printed on my INTEL budget and passed out to the world. What we tried to say was: ‘Here it is. We’ve signed up for it. We’re going to make this work, and if you want to put a standards stamp on it, that’s fine.’ Of course, we didn’t really take into account the fact that there were lots of other people in the world with other axes to grind that would try to perturb the standard, and in hindsight, maybe we should have just held it quiet for another couple of years until we were delivering, but we took it to the IEEE and a lot of people spent a lot of money fighting Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddle characterizes the waiting committee of skeptical engineers as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The howling mob at the IEEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an October announcement meant to stem the token tide, HP endorsed, and pledged active support, for a CSMA/CD standard. (An action seeded in the monthly meetings between Kaufman and Crockett.) Don Loughry of HP reflects on the tension:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the May meeting in Washington D.C. [NBS], DEC, Intel and Xerox presented their Ethernet solution. They made a strategic blunder. They basically said: ‘We have THE answer.’ But it backfired. They didn’t understand what they had to do to sell something, that you just don’t present a solution and expect one hundred other companies to say: ‘Rah,’ especially the likes of the large companies involved. So then the dust began to settle a little bit, and on September 30th Ethernet Rev. 1 was produced. By that time, there was a real need to begin to put this thing together in an orderly fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next meeting in Phoenix in December loomed like a championship prize-fight. If there was to be one standard, a choice between CSMA/CD and token passing seemed imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman Graube recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was becoming clear to me that things were not going to converge into anything.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughry of HP, who would play an important role during and after the meeting, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, at this December meeting, this was known and kind of forecast by those that were on the inside, to be a real shoot-out, because this was the time that they were going to sink CSMA/CD and it was going to be buried, and some rather large companies were determined to make that happen. I was sort of elected, or promoted, or whatever – nominated – by the likes of Metcalfe and John Schoch, to be the cheerleader and the spokesperson for CSMA/CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman of Intel remembers the attitude of the DIX members, especially Intel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our strategy fundamentally was ‘they’re not going to kill Ethernet, and if IEEE kills Ethernet, we don’t care because there’s nothing else at this point.’ IBM was talking about token ring, but had no spec, and if they did have a spec, they wouldn’t release it, and the people they sent clearly didn’t speak for IBM and kept saying they wouldn’t speak for IBM. So what the IEEE was talking about in terms of token was a non sequitur to us. We were going to ship CSMA/CD no matter what, and we were going to follow the IEEE, and if they settled on something, we’d ship it that way. If they didn’t settle on something by the time the chip was ready, we’d ship the chip, and that’s why we were calling it the ‘Eithernet’ chip, because of all the variations that were coming along in CSMA/CD, not because we were going to make a token ring part of it. Nobody knew how to make one of those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting a combination of the PROWAY and IBM proponents aligned in favor of token technology as the basis of the future Committee 802 LAN standard. In the vote to endorse tokenism, the ayes failed to achieve the required three-quarters majority.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; It was equally apparent, however, that neither could CSMA/CD – Ethernet – attract a three-quarters majority. Seemingly at an impasse, Committee 802 crafted a compromise: two standards would be created. The choice avoided failure, even disbanding. Two new subcommittees, CSMA/CD and token passing, appended the existing three subcommittee structure. Loughery became chairman of the CSMA/CD subcommittee.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; (See Exhibit 9.4 Committee 802 Subcommittee Structure.[14])To maintain some semblance of one standard, the Committee required all specifications other than the access algorithms to be identical and all members continued to vote on both standards; rules seeding future conflict.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal, an informed user, felt betrayed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My view was that this was a real disaster. Here I was trying to make standards for use in the government, and now I’ve got to choose between two technologies. I was furious, but I had to live with that. So I turned my attention to the CSMA/CD arena because of all of the stuff I knew about CSMA/CD. I knew it very, very well, and I had a network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1981, the editorial headline in Data Communications magazine’s Viewpoint read: “IEEE decision places a roadblock in local networking’s path.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; The scathing editorial ended with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The IEEE should reconvene its local network standards committee as soon as possible and should face up to the challenge of the industry by deciding on a meaningful standard for local-network access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube in an article in the same issue of Data Communications labeled the Committee 802 decision as: “sort of a cop out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 9.4 IEEE Committee 802 Subcommittee Structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1142-ieee-committee-802-subcommittee-structure&quot;&gt;Exhibit 11.4.2 IEEE Committee 802 Subcommittee Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-11.4.2_IEEE_Committee_802_Structure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of IEEE Committee 802 Subcommittee Structure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAN technologies and economics had complicated the plans of Committee 802.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;When last observed at year-end 1979, the International Standards Organization Technical Committee (ISO/TC 97) had just approved the OSI Reference Model as a Working Draft (WD) and had authorized Subcommittee 16 (SC16) to make the requested changes and resubmit it as a Draft Proposal (DP). Embedded in the Reference Model WD was the fundamental assumption of communications by making connections, not launching datagrams; this notwithstanding the fact that the leading LAN technologies used datagrams, not connections, to communicate between devices.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; Since the Reference Model WD failed to embrace datagram protocols, it could not satisfy the rapidly growing LAN community. Excerpting language from the introduction of the eventual standard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The assumption that a connection is a fundamental prerequisite for communication in the OSI environment permeates the Reference Model and is one of the most useful and important unifying concepts of the architecture which it describes.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OSI terminology, physical and virtual circuits were addressed by connection protocols whereas datagrams were considered connection-less protocols. Physical or virtual circuit architectures create connections before transmitting data whereas datagram architectures simply transmit data without establishing connections, hence, connection-less. The major LAN technologies, such as CSMA/CD and token passing, were connection-less and therefore were unaddressed by the Reference Model WD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection-based Reference Model satisfied the PTT’s, but for those wanting reliable end-to-end communications over the public data networks or LANs, it meant creating:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;a transport layer protocol providing reliable end-to-end service&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;a change to the Reference Model to allow connection-less communications&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;a connection-less network layer protocol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The omission of connection-less communications from the Reference Model WD concerned many European computer scientists as well as Rosenthal and others at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) committed to having the U.S. Government adopt the eventual OSI standards. But since NBS’s pioneering network, NBSnet, used a CSMA/CD, or connection-less, protocol. If OSI did not include connection-less protocols resembling those evolving in the U.S., NBS would have to abandon its goal of adopting OSI standards. In response, NBS pursued a multi-prong strategy. First, NBS sought help from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the U.S. representative to ISO. Only, ANSI’s members, companies, favored proprietary technologies and questioned the economic value of international standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBS next approached the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). ECMA, although not a formal member of ISO, attended SC16 meetings by invitation. ECMA shared NBS’s concern regarding the lack of OSI connection-less protocols for LANs. For years, ECMA had monitored or participated in INWG and IFIP discussions regarding the need for datagram protocols.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; So ECMA welcomed the NBS as an ally and invited NBS representatives to ECMA meetings.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Heafner, head of NBS’s Systems and Network Architecture Division starting in January 1979 and responsible for all NBS networking activities, including OSI protocols, remembers wanting OSI to adopt transport protocols similar to the DOD TCP protocol:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So through ECMA and other sources, we pushed the definitions written in ISO-ese of the DOD protocols, in particular Class IV Transport, which is the match with TCP. Our thrust from the beginning was to work in ISO, and to some extent CCITT, to make sure that government needs were covered when those protocols were being developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1980, knowing time was of the essence, ECMA submitted a draft proposal to both ISO and CCITT recommending four classes of transport protocols, ranging from a minimal protocol for connection networks to a TCP-like protocol for connection-less networks. (All classes would function over a connection-oriented network layer.) ECMA, however, needed an inside champion to argue their cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1980, ECMA’s champion emerged. The French PTT, influenced by the changing regulatory environment in the U.S. - i.e. deregulation and the Computer Inquiries - and their growing awareness of the merging of computers and telecommunications, recruited Zimmerman from IRIA, a data processing research institute, to join Centre National d’Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET), the research institute for the French PTT - its Bell Labs. Zimmerman’s new role ideally positioned him to bridge the differences separating ISO and CCITT. He reflects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for moving was the will of the French PTT to put together, or to get more, of the data processing culture. It was agreed that I would keep participating in standards, as I had done before, and from that time was in a much better position to act as a go-between ISO and CCITT. So I was, within ISO, still in charge of the OSI reference model group, and people knew that I had moved to the PTT’s. They could see that it did not change my way of managing and pushing things, and it was clear that it was supported by the French PTT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1980, facilitated by Zimmerman as well as the more receptive attitude within CCITT to data processing-oriented standards, CCITT and ISO jointly announced tentative support for ECMA’s transport protocol proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman’s next challenge was managing the approval of the Reference Model at the upcoming SC16 meeting in Berlin. Success could not be assumed. Zimmerman knew the current version of the Reference Model had problems. How could it not? Designed as it was by an international committee in record time. Some problems were merely cosmetic, such as the correct use of the English language. Other problems were more serious. The U.S. delegation, for example, repeatedly questioned the fundamental objective of a Reference Model. They lobbied that the Reference Model be circulated as a simple technical report rather than passed as a standard with permanent consequences. Zimmerman thought the Americans undervalued the benefit of making the Reference Model hard to change. (He also recognized the ambivalence among the Americans; many whom would prefer the market decide technological issues, not a public body.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem that concerned Zimmerman most was whether the right balance between “time to market” and technological elegance had been achieved. Many people, including Zimmerman, recognized that a collaborative standards process did not result in a perfect technical answer. However, for a standard to work in the real world required widespread acceptance despite technical weaknesses and conflicting requirements. Zimmerman recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At that time, somehow, we had to admit, and I was convinced pretty early, that we shouldn’t have something which was far from being perfect from a technical point of view, but had to be accepted and endorsed by the major players. We put a fair amount of pressure for, at some point in time, just freezing things, and saying: ‘Unless there’s a very good reason to change something, we won’t change it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the SC16 meeting in Berlin in November 1980, an air of excitement fueled by nearly three years of hard work energized every crowded meeting room. As the estimated 200 attendees eagerly awaited the vote to approve the Reference Model as a DP, each country delegation formally presented their review of the Reference Model and recommended, or not, its passage. John Aschenbrenner of IBM led the U.S. delegation that again argued that the Reference Model should be approved as a technical report, not as a standard. The dull thud that followed hardly had time to reach the back of the room when Mike Purton of the British Standards Institute gave, as Bachman would recall: “his infamous speech,” condemning the Reference Model for its misuse of the English language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman remembers the backlash to Purton’s speech reporting that the U.K. delegation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Had given this document to their experts, and they had said unanimously that this document should be put in the basket. That was the end of it, because telling this to a bunch of people who had been working hard as hell to produce something, who know that it’s not really perfect but it has some value, telling them that it’s just good for the paper basket, that was the end of it. Everybody agreed. The U.S. said: ‘We’ll just abstain. We’ll not oppose,’ and that is the way the OSI Reference Model moved to the DP stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the OSI Reference Model a DP effectively ordered the layering of computer communication protocols even though OSI had yet to create an actual protocol standard.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Throughout 1979, Kahn and Cerf lobbied the DOD to make TCP/IP an official communication protocol standard. In January 1980, after a year of code testing, Postel posted the two new protocols, TCP and IP, as Request for Comments (RFCs) and simultaneously as DOD standards.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; Once published as standards, the hard work of converting all networks, including ARPANET, to TCP/IP began. The date of January 1, 1983 was set for the cutover of ARPANET to TCP/IP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of these developments were not lost on Rosenthal and others at NBS who had decided earlier to standardize on OSI protocols for the Federal Government. Since many branches of the Federal Government needed to have effective computer communications with the DOD, how would TCP/IP and OSI interoperate? To explore these issues and others, in May 1980, NBS held a workshop entitled: Trends and Applications 1980: Computer Network Protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DARPA pushed on, and by August 1980, had implemented the new TCP/IP protocol in 12 gateways interconnecting 10 networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; In an auspicious sign of the desire to cooperate, in December 1980, the DOD publicly unveiled TCP/IP at the NBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efforts of Xerox’s Systems Development Division (SDD) to upgrade the Pup protocol to XNS progressed nearly in parallel with TCP/IP during these same years. Yogen Dalal, who had assumed management of most of SDD’s networking group after Metcalfe’s departure in late 1978, stayed abreast of changes to TCP and OSI. Dalal remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were aware of the concept of the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model. Hubert Zimmerman and those people were trying to define that. We tried to influence many of those thoughts. I guess we were a little bit more applied, so while the Reference Model had a lot of formal verbiage, we tried to inject the layman’s translation of that or what a programmer would think. We considered it somewhat academic, that it was a reference model that attempted to formalize what all of us knew, and the Reference Model, as most models did, attempted to concentrate on the bottom layers because people had experience with the bottom layers, and the higher layers became sort of fuzzy because you hadn’t got to that yet. The influence was nominal, primarily because Xerox made it difficult for us to talk about some of our experiences, and many of our differences on how we viewed the model had to do with the higher level protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1979, when Dalal learned from his boss, David Liddle, that Xerox, DEC and Intel were cooperating to standardize Ethernet, Dalal argued that Xerox should also commercialize XNS or try to make it a standard. Dalal remembers asking Liddle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Why can’t we get Xerox to sell or to standardize its network architecture product in addition to its commercial product?’ We had something, we knew it was the cat’s meow, an important revolution, and we were going to make it succeed. Other parts of the company had similar visions of grandeur, but were afraid that if they gave the standard out, they would lose control. That was the biggest mistake Xerox ever made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xerox management feared making XNS public even more than Ethernet, for the differentiating intelligence making possible sophisticated printers, print servers and file servers resided in XNS, not Ethernet. The first commercial product built around the new capabilities of XNS and Ethernet was the Xerox 8000 Network System (X 8000) announced in November 1980, just two months after DIX made public the Blue Book and one month before the public unveiling of TCP/IP.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;  The X 8000 consisted of a graphics-based user computer (the 860 workstation), laser printers, and various other peripherals, all connected using Ethernet and XNS. Metcalfe, now with 3Com, opines in the December issue of Data Communications that the architecture of the X 8000:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;points the way for future design of shared-resource networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In November 1980, the sigh of collective relief that the OSI Reference Model had advanced to the DP stage reinvigorated those seeking to influence the various protocol designs. For the members of ISO TC 97/SC16 the definition of the transport layer protocols, especially the need for an end-to-end datagram protocol, became a priority. CCITT already had made its demands known when it approved its transport layer standard for teletext - Recommendation S.70 - several months earlier.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;  In January 1981, ECMA standardized on the five classes of transport protocols it had earlier recommended to both ISO and CCITT: class 2 being equivalent to CCITT’s S.70 and class 4 being equivalent to TCP.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;  Predictably, these actions influenced the proceedings of SC16 that prized agreement with both CCITT and ECMA and joint meetings ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Reference Model advancing to the DP stage, it’s near certain standardization induced a flurry of commercial activity. At the National Computer Conference (NCC) in May, data communications took center stage for the first time; with seminars such as “Transport and Session Protocols in the Context of the ISO Reference Model” and “Local Networks and the Ethernet in Particular.” Luminaries such as Cerf, Greg Hopkins, David Potter, and John Day gave talks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;  Articles on OSI (“Coming of Age: A Long-awaited Standard for Heterogeneous Nets,”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;  and “Reality and the Proposed OSI Standard”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;) began appearing in technical and industry publications. And the undeniable importance of the connection protocol X.25 gained support with first AT&amp;amp;T in January and then IBM in June announcing products. No wonder Zimmerman had felt the pressure to complete work on the Reference Model so protocol standards work could begin: market forces were already at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1982, less than a year after circulating the Reference Model DP 7498 to its members for passage, TC 97 approved the Reference Model as a Draft International Standard (DIS) and forwarded it to ISO for vote by its full membership. With virtually all of the uncertainty about the Reference Model becoming a standard eliminated, (notwithstanding the continuing criticism from the U.S. delegation that the Reference Model should be a technical document and not a standard) both committees, SC6 and SC16, felt pressured to begin producing the protocols needed to actually build products. To do so meant creating two standards – Services and Protocols – for each layer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1982, SC16 at its Tokyo meeting acted first when it approved as Draft Proposals (DPs) both transport layer Service (ISO/DP 8072) and Protocol (ISO/DP 8073) standards. The U.S. (ANSI) once again voted “no” – citing incompatibility among the five classes of DP 8073 as well as the claim that the DP could not be implemented.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;  Efforts to resolve the U.S. objections, as well as objections of others, prior to forwarding the DPs to TC 97 took on a new level of seriousness. Modifying TP-4, the virtual circuit protocol over connection-less networks, was assigned to the NBS; virtually guaranteeing a protocol similar to TCP. Despite the differences, the quick action on DP 8072/73 reflected real cooperation with both CCITT and ECMA. (After all, both CCITT and ECMA got what they wanted and more: class TP-0 providing minimal functionality, consistent with a connection network layer such as X.25, and class TP-4, providing functionality comparable to TCP, sought by the computer community.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, progress within SC6 to create a connection-less protocol at the network layer stalled while the committee completed its connection-based Service and Protocol standards. In part, progress lagged because the Reference Model did not yet call for connection-less communications. What motivation would a connection-oriented committee have to create a connection-less protocol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the fall of 1982, Reference Model DIS 7498 votes began coming in and the U.S. once again voted no.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt; While the three objections that accompanied the no vote were the same ones the U.S. had attached to prior yes votes, the fact that the U.S. – the secretariat –voted no seemed divisive.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt; In a December 1982 Data Communications article titled: “Network users group shocked as ANSI votes against OSI model,” Sheldon Blauman, founder of the Network Users Association (NUA) was quoted:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is both a surprise and a shock to me. A vote against Open Systems Interconnection is like a vote against apple pie and motherhood. I see the situation as rather frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the final vote on DIS 7498 tallied 22 yes, 2 no, and 1 abstention, declaring 7498 an International Standard remained on hold while an effort was made to resolve the US objections. (Voting no with the U.S. was Germany.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At year-end 1982, the promise of OSI to bring order to the conflicting technologies within computer communications remained just that, a promise. The overarching OSI architecture of Reference Model DIS 7498 seemed close to becoming an international standard. But since DIS 7498 assumed a connection paradigm, accommodating the connection-less world of LANs meant a Reference Model addendum – a document modifying an existing standard – although being worked on, had to be voted through the same DP, DIS, ISO process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one encouraging note, SC16 passed a TP-4 version of DP 8073: a virtual circuit protocol over a connection-based network. Yet until SC6 passed a connection-less network layer, LAN products using ISO OSI standards remained only a distant possibility. What were LAN manufacturers to do in the meantime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At year-end 1982, two connection-less, or datagram, communication protocols for LANs did exist: TCP/IP and XNS. Their success would impact the eventual outcome of OSI.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

The intended cut over date for Arpanet, the most important network of the day, was January 1, 1983, years away. The project timeline was not without perils. First, BBN had to make Arpanet’s Subnet TCP/IP-compatible. Then came the complicated issue of creating host TCP/IP code for all the essential computers connected to Arpanet. There was no desire to let each host site create its own version of TCP/IP, a painful lesson learned in creating the original host software now to be replaced. In 1981, DARPA awarded seven contracts to create computer host code. The contract to port TCP/IP to UNIX went to BBN. (See Exhibit 11.8.1 TCP/IP Ports)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt; BBN would then give its TCP/IP code to Bill Joy at Berkeley to integrate into the upgraded version of UNIX Joy was developing for the VAX computer. Creating host ports began once Postel posted the TCP/IP standard as RFCs 791 and 702 in September 1981.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 11.8.1 TCP/IP Ports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract With&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BBN (Bolt Beranek and Newman)&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BBN C-Series Systems; TOPS-20&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Tech.)&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;IBM PC&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BSD Unix 4.2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;IBM Mainframes running MVS O/S&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;IBM Mainframes running VM O/S&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xerox’s strategy for XNS contrasted starkly with the wide distribution policy the DOD had for TCP/IP. Xerox wanted to keep XNS proprietary and under its control. Xerox had created XNS so that all of its office products might work together seamlessly, hoping to seize a competitive advantage over more entrenched companies like IBM in the battle for the “Office of the Future.” Only customers had become leery of one-vendor solutions and wanted all vendors’ equipment to interoperate. That realization had prompted Xerox to let the contract to Ungermann-Bass to port XNS to its NUI terminal switch in the fall of 1980.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; Permitting customers to connect other vendors’ computer terminals to Xerox XNS networks was a trivial decision compared to the one of making XNS public and giving away what many inside Xerox thought to be a real competitive advantage. Those arguing otherwise, to make XNS public, wanted to make Ethernet the LAN of choice, and there was no doubt that XNS made Ethernet sing.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt; Metcalfe remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were working on LANs, and he [Cerf at DARPA] was working on 50 kilobit per second telephone circuits and that’s a substantial difference. And that’s why TCP is so slow and XNS is so fast.  So, XNS was built to-be-carried over multi-megabit per second transport facilities and TCP was designed with an intuition about modems and slow stuff. So you run TCP on a LAN and it is slow, in fact, it’s twice as slow, half the speed of XNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1981, the market pressure on Xerox to make XNS public grew substantially when Xerox announced its 8010 Star Information System; a workstation designed to be an “electronic desktop” and pioneered the icon-based user interface.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt; (Its price, $15,000, proved way too expensive and the product was destined to fail.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to justify keeping XNS completely under wraps, Xerox made some, but not all, of XNS public in December 1981.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt; Dalal recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happened was, with Ethernet being out there, they felt that you had to give the next levels out, so they got XNS, in terms of the datagram and the session protocol and Jim White’s Courier, which is a way to exchange procedure calls back and forth, but they were hesitant to send out the filing protocol, the printing protocol, the name look-up protocol, the electronic mail protocol; all the protocols that you really needed to do something. Again, I think they felt the lower level protocols, it was OK to send out so that the Ungermann-Basses and the Bridges could build connectivity hardware, but nobody could really build servers that would compete with Star or the filing systems that Xerox was producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Xerox published only the lower layers of XNS mattered little to the start-up LAN companies whose first generation products were largely terminal switches, known derisively as “milking machines.” LAN vendors had the choice to either wait patiently or invent their own network protocols, for as of year-end 1981 neither TCP/IP nor OSI were available. So even with its minimal functionality, XNS use spread: making it the early market leader of LAN protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, out-of-no-where, in mid-1982, in another example of historical accident and the never-ending importance of the individual in history, Berkeley released a new version of UNIX that had embedded within a rewritten version of TCP/IP. Only it was not the version of TCP/IP that DARPA had contracted with BBN to rewrite and give to Joy who would integrate it with UNIX. Joy found the TCP/IP code lacking and decided to rewrite it. Kahn remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bill Joy just didn’t feel like this [the BBN code] was as efficient as he could do if he did it himself. And so Joy just rewrote it. Here the stuff was delivered to him, he said, “That’s a bunch of junk,” and he redid it. There was no debate at all. He just unilaterally redid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company, university or other user could purchase a UNIX source code license from Berkeley for $32,000 and receive TCP/IP code essentially free. And since Joy’s UNIX port had been to the VAX, the TCP/IP worked with Ethernet. Others began porting the code to other computers and, overnight, XNS had a real competitor; a competitive product not constrained by the release of higher layer functionality. The diffusion of TCP/IP was also aided by the agreement Kahn had made with Gordon Bell and Sam Fuller of DEC for DEC to sell bundled VAXs at super low prices to universities. Kahn remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I convinced Gordon Bell and Sam Fuller that if they made these VAXs available, people would explore interesting ways to do distributed computing on them, and that was going to be the wave of the future, and they might as well understand it, and DEC said, “Okay, we’ll do that, but you have to guarantee that you’re not going to use these machines as stand-alone timesharing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the availability of VAX/UNIX/TCP/IP, and the subsequent porting of Joy’s TCP/IP code to other computers, market forces swept TCP/IP forward in a way no one could have planned. Once again, DARPA played a critical role in the advancement of local area networking as a secondary consequence to a primary objective (as had the use of IMPs and TIPs to create an early version of LANs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus within DARPA remained the approaching January 1983 deadline to convert ARPANET to TCP/IP rather than their impact on the commercial success of LANs however. Converting ARPANET to TCP/IP required leaders and plans. That job fell to Dan Lynch, who in 1980 left SRI to become responsible for the computer facilities at the University of Southern California’s Information Science Institute (ISI) –  “the biggest node on the Arpanet.” Just as Roberts before him, Lynch would have to resort to strong-armed tactics to enforce the users of Arpanet to convert to TCP/IP. Cerf remembers one attention-getting tactic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle of 1982, we turned off the NCP capability for one entire day on the Arpanet, leaving the only people able to communicate the ones who had implemented TCP. There was a lot of noise as a result, but it got attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complaints and problems intensified, as summer became September. Lynch recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember when we really started getting serious in September and had TCP-only half days and then whole days and then there was sort of a monthly event and then I think we did a three day one around Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the conversion date of January 1, 1983 looming ever larger, the white light of attention fell first on Lynch and then onto Clark, whom Cerf had appointed Chairman of the Internet Working Group in September 1981. Cerf knew it was time for him to leave DARPA and had increasingly moved to the periphery of action. When he announced his resignation from DARPA to join MCI and manage their email efforts in December 1982, the news seemed hardly noteworthy to those in the trenches scrambling to prepare for News Year Eve. Lynch, to commemorate the toil of the occasion, used his own money to make 500 white pins with a message in red: “I survived the TCP transition, 1/1/83.” And they did survive for the transition happened on schedule. So notwithstanding crashes and lingering problems, one could no longer doubt TCP/IP worked for it now supported networks ranging from Ethernet to Arpanet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With both TCP/IP and XNS providing network and transport layer services over Ethernet LANs, the big question became: Would IEEE 802 sanction a CSMA/CD standard approximating Ethernet?&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The life-saving reorganization of IEEE Committee 802 in December 1980 to create two standards - token passing and CSMA/CD - eased immediate tensions without solving fundamental problems. The token-bus and token-ring factions had combined solely to fight adoption of CSMA/CD; papering over substantive differences. Since the token and CSMA/CD standards had to advance in unison - according to IEEE 802 rules - the token coalition erected numerous hurdles to the better-prepared CSMA/CD community. The reorganization also spawned an unintended consequence: Committee 802’s struggles to define LAN standards became newsworthy. The larger technical/commercial communities would scrutinize future actions of Committee 802 as never before by. LAN standards had become important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disappointed Graube, founder and chairman of Committee 802, had witnessed his goal of one standard compromised away and knew if he didn’t assert the authority of his office, the slippery slope of fractious debate might preclude any standards. Seeking to understand the progress of the subcommittees in an effort to focus future meeting agendas, he remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I simply asked each of the people that were working on documents to give me what they had. I took them all back to Tektronix and I put together a composite document, our first Draft A, and it was a total mess. You could see that there just wasn’t any standard whatsoever. All we were doing was listing a catalog of the way you could do things, rather than the way you should do things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mess or not, in May 1981, Draft A represented Committee 802’s stake in the ground, or more aptly, a mirage on shifting sands. Work on a next version began immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious lack of convergence induced growing concern within NBS and Xerox whether Committee 802 could create standard(s). NBS, having already decided in favor of CSMA/CD, feared delays and further compromises might lead to a standard not to their liking. To rally support for CSMA/CD, and prove it was more than the stepchild of DIX, NBS turned again to ECMA, the organization that had been so constructive in working towards an OSI Class IV protocol.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; Meanwhile, Xerox had been lobbying Siemens to become a reseller of its soon-to-be introduced Star workstation. As Siemens’ interests in reselling Xerox’s Star grew, so did its interests in having ECMA adopt a CSMA/CD standard equivalent to Ethernet, the LAN integrated into the Star. Siemens consequently began promoting a CSMA/CD standard within ECMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Committee 802, if its internal contortions did not cloud the future of LAN standards enough, a steady stream of new LAN technology announcements, all claiming superiority over those being debated within IEEE 802, were reported by the press.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt; No announcement caused more problems than that of Wangnet by Wang in June 1981.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt; A leader in word processing and office automation, Wang had enough market power to cause a stir with every new product announcement and Wangnet was no exception. By reshuffling the very technologies considered by Committee 802, Wangnet seized instant credibility and disrupted the existing standards debates. Like the token bus proposed by the PROWAY supporters, Wangnet was a broadband network. Carved out of its enormous bandwidth was a 12 megabits per second CSMA/CD channel, rather than the 10 megabits per second of Ethernet. In addition, Wangnet promised channels carrying voice, video, and even traditional point-to-point data communications. In short, Wangnet promised something for everyone.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt; Wang promised delivery ranging from February to October 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wangnet announcement highlighted why Committee 802 needed to publish LAN standards as soon as possible. In mid-1981 that meant transforming the Draft A mess into a Draft B that could be submitted for membership voting. Seeking help from others, Graube remembers his frustrations with ISO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t think the ISO people knew what they were doing, because at times, we would ask for their guidance, in terms of how we described these standards, the Reference Model It was a mess, trying to track what they were doing, using them as guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang’s announcement created problems for IBM as well, and that in turn created additional problems for Committee 802. The superficially aligned token factions now found the antagonistic IBM and Wang under the same roof. Robert Donan, who had been recruited out of retirement by IBM in early 1981 to organize its LAN standards-making efforts, held the title of ‘Standards Project Authority.’ Donan’s career included leading the team that announced SDLC in 1969 and years of experience beginning with the SDLC/HDLC standardization process and interfacing with ECMA, CCITT and ISO.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;  He knew a priority was to create an insurmountable distinction between token ring and token bus. He remembers the impossible bedfellows in the fall of 1981:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It turned out that, just constantly, the needs of token ring and token bus were divergent. The token ring people saw a very fancy priority scheme, for instance, which is in token ring today, with which you can do all sorts of weird and wonderful things that aren’t even possible in token bus. This has to do with the nature of everything going by every station, which is true for token ring and not for token bus. If you say; ‘Make ring and bus look alike,’ what you do is reduce it to one common denominator, and you get the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illusion of one token standard, created as an artifice to defeat CSMA/CD, was destined to collapse, hastened by the market entry of Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally in October 1981, Committee 802 published a 400-page Draft B to a waiting and critical audience. Doubters argued its certain failure: too many details and too many options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supporters of Ethernet again felt frustrated that the passage of their standard was being held up by the need of a parallel token passing standard. How could they put pressure on Committee 802 to pass a CSMA/CD standard equivalent to the Blue Book? For help they once again appealed to ECMA members. In November 1981, their efforts paid off when ECMA created technical group TG LN under Technical Committee 24 to develop LAN standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the December Committee 802 meeting, the incompatibilities between token bus and token ring (accentuated by animosities between IBM and Wang) led to a reordering of the standards-making efforts from CSMA/CD and tokenism to bus and ring.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;  Token bus was argued to be more aligned with CSMA/CD; itself a bus-based technology proven to work over a broadband cable like token bus.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc50&quot; href=&quot;#fn50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;  What better logic than grouping bus-based LANs that could be baseband-CSMA/CD or broadband-token bus; and token ring-based LANs?&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orthogonal leap in LAN argument created both confusion and an ensuing war of words of baseband vs. broadband. It now pitted DIX against Wang instead of IBM against Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry McDowell, who had attended IEEE 802 meetings from the very beginning, joined Wang in late 1981 to assume responsibility for all communications technologies, including Wangnet. He remembers the war of words that engulfed LANs for years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What tended to happen was that every time that there was a trade show, I’d get invited to speak about broadband and Liddle or Bell would be talking about the baseband technology and the press wars were Baseband vs. Broadband. Which is Better? And we’d cast spears at each other, and I’d say, ‘Look, on broadband I can do video and I can do voice and I can do data,’ and they’d turn around and say, ‘Yeah, but who needs it?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Draft B assumed all but dead, and ECMA rumored to be closing in on LAN standards, and the Committee 802 again reorganizing, standards-creating by Committee 802 appeared to be unraveling once again. Loughry, of HP and leader of the CSMA/CD camp, opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dissension was appearing in the ranks. There was bad press at that time that IEEE 802 was going nowhere, nobody could agree, etc. Well, this was because we were not abiding by our own rules. We were just really not doing things in a healthy technical way, or a healthy political way. We were not a democratic group at one time in our history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d toss and turn at night and go to those meetings like going off to wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1982, Committee 802 met under intense pressure to hammer out a passable Draft C. Drafts A and B had been works-in-process circulated to solicit feedback that could be incorporated into the eventual standards. Such an iterative approach now seemed slow and indecisive however. The time had come to specify standards: period. To do so seemed impossible if they had to hold to their original and lofty goal of having all access methods – CSMA/CD, token bus, and token ring – operate over all media, e.g. baseband and broadband cable, twisted pair wiring and fiber optics. An expedient solution coming out of December’s reorganization, and confirmed by market behavior, was to associate each access method with a primary medium. While compromising the initial goal, it did look like a way to streamline the standards-making process. Hence, the baseband cable access method became CSMA/CD, broadband cable became token bus, and twisted-pair wiring became token ring. A path to standards seemed had been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same February meeting, the CSMA/CD standard moved further away from the DIX proposal. In Data Communications in March 1982, Graube judged the two CSMA/CD proposals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Total incompatibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then later in February 1982, the tug-of-war to define a CSMA/CD standard intensified. ECMA’s TG LN committee, that had worked in close cooperation with Xerox, DEC, Siemens and Olivetti, completed a draft CSMA/CD standard closer to DIX’s Blue Book than the Committee 802 proposal that was diverging from the Blue Book. Adding even more pith to DIX’s call for an Ethernet standard, 24 companies made public their intention to introduce Ethernet products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Committee 802 members felt they had finally resolved the roadblocks to standards, it must have been a shock to read the headline of a Data Communications March editorial Viewpoint: “The grim tale of a standards committee that has lost sight of its role and its importance.” Disparaging the proposal of associating each access method with a primary medium, the editorial ended with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before the IEEE 802 committee is guilty of trying to engineer a giant leap backwards, it ought to think through the consequences of its proposal. If approved, it will shine as the brightest example ever of a non-standard standard. If rejected – as well it should be – the committee will move even further away from its once universally held posture of seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article in that same issue of Data Communications was titled: “Local network standards: No utopia.’&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt; It warned of the need for market acceptance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The buyer well knows that many major high-technology innovations have been made commercial successes not by established giants, but by start-up ventures. Therefore buyers who have to select a local network product will not have their prayers answered by standards-making bodies. Those who are not early adopters will wait for marketplace standards no matter when the 802 or any other committee formulates standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the institutional legitimacy of Committee 802 at risk, 22 members, including all committee chairmen but not Graube or Rosenthal, drafted a response published in the April Data Communications Viewpoint. In it, they argued of the enabling role of standards to encourage VLSI semiconductor manufacturing to achieve lower cost LAN chips:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The solution to the volume problem is, of course, the development of appropriate standards that not only enable equipment of varying manufactures to intercommunicate but provide the volume by narrowing the alternatives  – and thus the raison d’être for IEEE Project 802.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critical press and undeniable confusion belaboring LAN standards caused problems for more than Graube and Committee 802. Bell of DEC remembers many testy meetings justifying DEC’s involvement in the fight for a CSMA/CD standard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I said: ‘Hey, we’ve got to have it. It’s just a wire that connects all these things. No big deal.’ Meanwhile the press is raising hell. I said: ‘Nothing’s happening here. It’s nothing. I don’t know if this stuff will ever be important, but we need to connect machines together.’ The Operations Committee kept saying: ‘Why are we giving this to the world?’ I said: ‘Wait a minute. We’re not giving anything to the world. We don’t have a protocol, we don’t happen to have the patent on either CSMA/CD or the ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1982, Committee 802 met again to resolve impasses to completing Draft C.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;  Four technical presentations by IBM personnel clarified its view of token ring technology and provided the data needed to specify a standard: one logjam broken. Equally, the actions of ECMA gave impetus to create a CSMA/CD standard close to the Blue Book, the opposite of what had been decided in February. Many, including Donan, viewed the actions of ECMA as an “end run”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;  around Committee 802 with the intent to force conformance to its, and essentially the Blue Book’s, Ethernet. It proved successful. Committee 802 once again acted to preserve its institutional legitimacy and changed its standard to conform to the proposal of ECMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube remembers that IEEE 802:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;simply bit the bullet and said: “OK, let’s move over to the ECMA position,” and that’s the kind of technology that was incorporated in the IEEE 802.3 standard. It’s basically as a result of this process of accommodating these different views. In my opinion, I think we did things which could have been done differently, which could have been done better. Of course, I’m an engineer, so I don’t know what’s better, but there were things done which were a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even while Committee 802 lurched to a Draft C, Graube and Rosenthal huddled, anxious to end the committee’s meanderings. Influencing them were the suggestions accompanying many of the B votes to approve three or even four standards. ,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt; (Thus, the willingness of Graube to accede to the standards proposals of February.) Rosenthal remembers their conversation when they accepted the inevitability of three standards: CSMA/CD, token bus and token ring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maris and I had long conversations about how to get rid of the personality problems and focus more on an organization and structure that would support outputs that we would be proud of, rather than the in-fighting. So we had to get rid of that old structure. We had to put in place an infrastructure that would be conducive to making real things happen. As a matter of fact, I remember, it was a cold, windy night in Minneapolis when we did that. We were just walking around the lake, and we figured out how to do that. We asked John Riganetti, a division chief at NBS and who was very close to the people in New York who were the movers and shakers in the IEEE, to help us orchestrate this new change that we wanted to put in place in 802. He taught us how to do that, really helped us do that, and we did it very successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube remembers the challenges of restructuring IEEE 802 to reflect three standards:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can remember having heart-to-heart talks with some of the opponents of this particular scheme of doing things, because they were losing their jobs as chairmen of these groups, which was not something they liked to do, nor was it easy for me to disenfranchise them, but it was something that needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolstering his courage and logic was the likelihood of IBM- and DIX-created standards. In June, for example, ECMA ratified a LAN standard very close to the DIX proposal by a vote of 13-2, including the affirmative vote of IBM.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;  (IBM voted for a DIX-like CSMA/CD with the tacit agreement that it would receive similar support for its LAN standard when announced – a date not yet set.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc59&quot; href=&quot;#fn59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;  That same month, DEC publicly announced its plans to deliver Ethernet products compatible with the Blue Book.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc60&quot; href=&quot;#fn60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;  In July 1982, 19 companies announced public support for the ECMA CSMA/CD standard.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc61&quot; href=&quot;#fn61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;  The press also reported Ethernet semiconductor chip announcements, or rumored announcements, by Intel, Seeq, Ungermann-Bass, Advanced Micro Devices and Mostek.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc62&quot; href=&quot;#fn62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behind-the-scenes effort to reorganize Committee 802 proved timely as de facto Ethernet standardization again challenged Committee 802’s role and authority. At the August meeting, the results of the voting on Draft C were reported. CSMA/CD received more than the needed three-fourths majority, as did token bus.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc63&quot; href=&quot;#fn63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;  Token ring came close, 73 percent, but needed another vote to pass. A proposal was then made by DIX to reorganize into three standards-making efforts: CSMA/CD, token bus and token ring.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc64&quot; href=&quot;#fn64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;  Each of the three standards would share a common link layer protocol, although the definition would differ from that being created within OSI. Furthermore, the three standards subcommittees would act independently. Loughry recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then we said things like: ‘The plenary is no longer a decision making body.’ We used to have plenary votes, in which the plenary of two hundred people would try to vote on issues, and – you just don’t have knowledgeable voting in a large body that only comes together for a few hours at the beginning and the end of the session. So, the plenary, then, was just dissemination of information, status reporting, and each of the individual committees really did the voting, and the executive committee would either affirm or deny what the working groups brought forward. So there was accountability to a higher group, but anybody in 802 could object to either the working group chairs or to the executive committee. We built in what you’d expect of normal, reasonable democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new subcommittees became: link layer (802.2), CSMA/CD (802.3), token bus (802.4) and token ring (802.5). Loughry became Chairman of 802.3, Donnan of 802.5, and Dave Carlson of AT&amp;amp;T 802.2. A succession of chairmen headed 802.4. Along with the reorganization, the decision was made to resubmit all three standards to another vote in hopes of improving the acceptance level of all. (The vote would only be on the proposed changes however.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then out of left field, Olaf Soderblom, a Swedish citizen, pronounced he held a U.S. patent issued in 1980 for a token-passing networking scheme covering the token ring under consideration.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc65&quot; href=&quot;#fn65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;   IBM, in fact, had already paid him $5 million for an unlimited license for future use.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc66&quot; href=&quot;#fn66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;   If uncertainty had clouded past token ring discussions, then Soderblom’s thunderclap rained darkness over its future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1982, DIX released version 2.0 of its “Blue Book” Ethernet to reflect changes from the many months of negotiations with Committee 802 and ECMA. It then essentially conformed to Committee 802’s Draft D. In December, at the meeting held at DEC, Committee 802 forwarded its CSMA/CD recommendation, standard 802.3, to the IEEE TCCC for approval. Both token bus and token ring required more work however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as ECMA had placed pressure on Committee 802 to standardize a Blue Book-like CSMA/CD, the movement to complete the 802.3 standard along with the availability of TCP/IP and XNS exerted new pressures on OSI t o promptly adopt LAN protocol standards.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1982, Graube and Rosenthal began focusing on what they saw as the next challenge in local area networking: the higher layer protocols. The two shared concerns over the timeliness of higher-layer software, especially the transport layer, the layer required for reliable end-to-end communications over a network. Graube remembers reflecting after it had become clear that at least one LAN standard, CSMA/CD, would be passed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘What do we do for these higher-layer protocols?’  Obviously, it was just like with the 488 standard business, where we had the transport mechanism, but the instruments still couldn’t communicate because there was no data format specified. So I wanted to see what we could do in terms of getting some agreements, what have you, for these higher-layer protocols; what was really needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal also recognized the need for testing of the protocols that each vendor would create. An OSI standard, while necessary, was not sufficient condition to assure commercial LAN products. Standards specifications could be implemented in an unlimited number of ways, hence the near certainty of incompatible implementations. To solve that problem, Rosenthal saw the use of agreements – contracts – among organizations to implement compatible-versions of transport protocol standards. But how would he get organizations to agree? Rosenthal remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order to pull this off, we had to get some agreements. That’s the key word, ‘agreements.’ We had to get the people highest up in these organizations to commit resources. We had to get a commitment of the CEOs, somebody with signature authority, had to be able to say: “Here’s the check, you make it happen.  Pull out all the stops. OSI is important. Make it happen.” We had to get the technical people to ask the question: “Make what happen?” We had to say: “Make this happen,” and we had to lay it out for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One CEO who responded to the invitation of NBS to attend a meeting was Roger Smith of General Motors (GM). GM had formed a task group in 1980 to look at the possibility of using computer-based automation to combat growing competition from companies producing in lower labor cost economies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc67&quot; href=&quot;#fn67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;  In 1981, GM held exploratory conversations with IBM, DEC and HP. From these efforts came the release of GM’s Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) version 1.0 in 1982.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc68&quot; href=&quot;#fn68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;  Since MAP operated over the LANs that interconnected automation equipment, GM was eager to hear what NBS had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ideal opportunity to discuss these issues with a wider community was after the IEEE 802 meeting held at DEC in December 1982, Graube convened a handful of concerned insiders to discuss how to create OSI transport layer software. Representatives of roughly six companies, Rosenthal and Graube attended. While all expressed concern, no one knew precisely what to do and little came of the meeting until shortly after Graube submitted his trip report at Tektronix. Graube remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The lightening bolt came down from the lawyers, through my boss, to me, and Zap! ‘Though shalt not do things like that anymore!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tektronix lawyers had recently dealt with the Department of Commerce on another standards matter and issues of antitrust had surfaced. Questions of standards preventing trade and of monopolistic practices had cooled Tektronix lawyers to the idea of companies meeting, clandestine or not, to discuss and create standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube remembers telling Rosenthal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Gee, I got my fingers slapped here for our little meeting in Tewksbury,’ and Robbie says: ‘Well, no problem. We hold these workshops at NBS all the time on various topics. Why don’t we hold an NBS workshop on implementers of local area networks?’ That’s where it started, basically. It works nicely because the National Bureau of Standards works under the Department of Commerce, where the anti-trust division is also located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1983, the first NBS International Workshop for Implementers of OSI met. Graube, viewed as the protagonist, was elected Chairman. Conversation quickly turned to the difficulties of ensuring compatible implementations and the desirability of motivating cooperation. Then similar to Roberts and Kahn’s motivation in 1972 to stage a public demonstration of Arpanet at the ICCC trade show, those attending the NBS OSI workshops came to the same conclusion: a public demonstration to coalesce cooperative behavior. They knew it would take time to organize, and settled on the largest computer tradeshow, the National Computer Conference (NCC) to be held in July 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collision of LAN interests and antitrust concerns could be read elsewhere when in February, IBM offered to buy 12 percent of Intel for $250 million and the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission made known their reservations.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc69&quot; href=&quot;#fn69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;  IBM publicly stated its investment was to assure that Intel, a leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturer and supplier of the microprocessor used in the IBM PC, had the capital to stay competitive with the aggressive Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. (IBM accounted for 13% of Intel’s sales.) But could IBM have been hedging its LAN bets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1983, ISO formally approved the Reference Model standard: ISO 7498. Already in process was an Addendum to the Reference Model to cover connection-less transmission. SC6, which had focused on creating a connection-oriented network layer protocol (8348) to submit as a DP, began work on a connection-less Addendum to 8348.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of the summer of 1983, ISO had standardized the Reference Model and approved a connection-less transport protocol. They had yet to decide what to do about the LAN protocols being developed within IEEE, and supported by ECMA, or a connection-less network layer protocol. Nevertheless, the promise of standards bringing an end to LAN confusion seemed almost tangible.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The years 1983-1984 represented a turning point in the history of LANs. The technological-economic dance of chaos and uncertainty shifted into standards resolution and economic growth. The first to benefit were Ethernet vendors. In 1983, Ethernet (CSMA/CD) became an IEEE, ECMA, and effectively an ISO/OSI standard. In addition, the conversion of Arpanet to TCP/IP on January 1, 1983 represented a milestone for DARPA and that TCP/IP had been successfully ported to all the leading computers of the day. By mid-year it would be available for the IBM PC. In contrast, Xerox refused to release more of XNS and, as a consequence, nearly all the LAN start-up’s would engineering their next generation products using TCP/IP not XNS. As for IBM, the lumbering giant, it would not be until 1984 before they make their intentions clear. That same year, the NCC public demonstration of OSI software was an important first step in proving the concept of vendor-independent OSI LAN software; albeit commercial products were still years away. As the finalization of standards became apparent, sales of LAN products soared 141% in 1983. Two years later they reached nearly $1 billion. Here then is a summary of those two critical years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 23, 1983, a day many had fought long and hard for, the IEEE ended years of debate and misdirection and approved CSMA/CD as standard 802.3. DIX and the corporate support Ethernet had garnered prevailed. It was the news supporters within ECMA had sought. With renewed energy they pressed their arguments that ISO adopt the CSMA/CD standard. The fact was: Ethernet worked despite years of arguments to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1983, IEEE 802 forwarded its token bus recommendation to the Technical Committee of Computer Communications (TCCC) for approval. Miller of Concord Data Systems remembers his role in the process:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in getting token bus passed, so great, holy shit, a little company pushed that through. We pretty much wrote the standard. The other company that participated was Amdax, another token bus start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Token ring, on the other hand, remained in limbo due to IBM’s vacillating leadership. In September 1983, they staged a technology demonstration of token ring in Zurich. Even so, no one expected a token ring standard recommendation to be out of committee until the spring of 1984.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc70&quot; href=&quot;#fn70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1983, ISO SC6 met. As expected, the membership passed the recommendation that the IEEE 802 LAN standards be adopted. Little doubt remained that the recommendations would be approved by ISO at its next meeting in January 1984. The need for SC6 to create a connection-less network layer protocol was all that stood in the way for ISO/OSI to have a comparable LAN protocol stack to TCP/IP over Ethernet.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc71&quot; href=&quot;#fn71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big question hovered over the emerging standards however: What was IBM going to do? (A decision referred to by some as: “the most speculated upon product of the decade.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;) The world’s dominant computer company had played its cards so close to its vest that it now seemed confused and oddly incompetent. Even without IBM’s stamp of approval, LANs had successfully run the gauntlet of international standards making. If IBM did not act soon, they might be left with the role of runner-up. Perhaps that motivated a cloaked presentation by Texas Instruments in February at the International Solid State Circuits Conference of a token ring chip set it had under development.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc73&quot; href=&quot;#fn73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;   If intended to quell rumors, it did little but fan them: chip problems held up IBM’s plans.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc74&quot; href=&quot;#fn74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 8, 1984, IBM made one of the most vilified product announcements of all time when it recommended the IBM Cabling System and pronounced its Statement of Direction.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc75&quot; href=&quot;#fn75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;   According to the Statement of Direction, IBM intended to implement a “star-wired token ring local area network using the IBM Cabling System within the next two to three years.” Implied was compatibility with the IEEE 802 standard. Far and away the most dominant computer company, long thought unassailable technologically, could only recommend how to wire ones’ facilities. And to trust their LAN solution would be available in two to three years. If ever an action had been meant to forestall market development, IBM delivered it that ignominious day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IBM shadow danced, the NBS-led efforts to stage an OSI-compliant LAN demonstrations at NCC progressed. In March 1984, GM and McDonnell Douglas held the first MAP users group meeting with 36 companies attending. Boeing, not to be left behind, announced that with the help of NBS it would lead the creation of an OSI protocol stack for technical and office environments, later to be named Technical and Office Protocols (TOP).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc76&quot; href=&quot;#fn76&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;   That same month, March, NBS released information on the OSI Class 4 Transport (TP-4) compatibility testing programs under development. It identified 421 scenarios to test the 5,700 lines of C code needed to implement TP-4.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc77&quot; href=&quot;#fn77&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;   (Another metric of the complexity of TP-4: an Intel spokesperson claimed it took 50 man-months to develop.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc78&quot; href=&quot;#fn78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;)  The considerable commitment needed to prepare for NCC had narrowed the list of potential participants to fifteen companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc79&quot; href=&quot;#fn79&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While general reviews of the NCC show held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 9-12, 1984, were mixed, all praised the NBS-led demonstrations. One review called NCC “by and large a ho-hum affair” with the exception of “two eye-opening demonstrations of open systems interconnection for local area networks.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc80&quot; href=&quot;#fn80&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;   The GM coordinated MAP over token bus (802.4) demonstration interconnected six devices from Allen-Bradley, Concord Data Systems, DEC, Gould, HP, IBM and Motorola. The more limited Boeing demonstration had files being swapped using TP-4 over 802.3 (CSMA/CD) between eight vendors: Advanced Computer Communications, Charles River Data Systems, DEC, Honeywell Information Systems, HP, ICL, Intel and NCR. The often-critical Data Communications editorial column, Viewpoint, ran the headline in August 1984: “Vendor-user partnership gives new meaning to standards.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc81&quot; href=&quot;#fn81&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;   The article ends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We anxiously await such products from all the participating vendors and congratulate them for what we hope becomes a role model for continued vendor-user cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workings of IEEE Committee 802, ISO, NBS, GM and now Boeing may have grabbed the headlines and chartering the future course of LANs, but the immediate driving force of LANs rested firmly with the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). In 1983, the growth rate of PC connections exceeded the overall market growth rate by 50%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc82&quot; href=&quot;#fn82&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt; The market for PC LANs was predicted to grow from $49 million in 1983 to $232 million in 1988.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc83&quot; href=&quot;#fn83&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;   So when IBM introduced its second generation PC, the IBM PC AT on August 1, 1984, it is little wonder that they felt the need to also introduce a LAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 14, 1984, IBM, after years of waiting, rumors, predictions, obfuscation and stonewalling, finally introduced its first LAN: the IBM PC Network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc84&quot; href=&quot;#fn84&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;   Was it the feared token ring that leveraged the customers’ investment in the IBM Cabling System? No and no again. It was a 2 megabit per second CSMA/CD broadband network OEM’ed from the start-up Sytek.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc85&quot; href=&quot;#fn85&quot;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;   Promising to carry video, it smacked of a poor man’s Wangnet. Even so, experts welcomed IBM’s market entry with pronouncements such as: “IBM’s announcement will change attitudes in the end-user community, which has hesitated to adopt local area networks.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc86&quot; href=&quot;#fn86&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt;   In August, AT&amp;amp;T introduced its first LAN, a slow version of CSMA/CD known as Starlan. It would be anything but a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was not alone in publicly aligning itself with one LAN technology and then switching its choice.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc87&quot; href=&quot;#fn87&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;   In the fall of 1984, the DOD, which had funded LAN development from the beginning, announced that it would adopt the ISO standards, implying that ISO protocols would supplant the existing DOD standard TCP/IP protocols.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc88&quot; href=&quot;#fn88&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;  This decision was further supported in a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study commissioned by the DOD. (Similar to the NAS study commissioned by the FCC to sort out telephony deregulation issues in 1969.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc89&quot; href=&quot;#fn89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1984, the IEEE approved the token bus standard (802.4). It was automatically adopted by ISO as an OSI standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 31, 1984, the momentum for OSI standards received another boost when NBS issued its first Federal Information Processing Standard 107 titled: Local Area Networks: Baseband Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications and Link Layer Protocol. It would become part of the government stack of protocols being developed by NBS known as Government OSI Information Protocols, or GOSIP. ISO’s OSI appeared the clear winner among computer communication protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, IEEE 802 forwarded the token ring (802.5) standard recommendation to IEEE TCCC. On December 31, 1984, all four IEEE 802 LAN standards were approved by ANSI. ISO approved all four standards as well.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

With the rules of the game settled, it was time to see what firms could best compete. No longer would compromises, agreements, and votes decide the future of LANs, it would be product offerings, prices and availability. Embraced within the new rules were connectionless, or datagram, protocols that had been dismissed by the powerful CCITT. Technological necessity and individual initiatives had prevailed and overcome the power of the entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now time to return to that fateful day in August 1981 when IBM introduced the PC and observed the intense competition among the firms of the Computer, Telecommunication, Data Communications and LAN market-structures and the coming into being of the networking market-structure.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.0/Overview/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the IBM PC in August 1981 forever changed the fortunes of the Networking companies. For once every corporate desktop became the likely home of a personal computer, a flood of innovative software and hardware drove the demand for higher communication speeds among computing devices. Both the PBX and dataPBX, designed for the slower speeds of computer terminals, could not meet customers’ needs. But that would not be obvious until the mid-1980s. Until then, the various incarnations of PBXs muddled customer decision-making and slowed market growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the explosive growth in sales of IBM PCs, and those of the quick-to-form swarm of clones, proved decisive for LANs. Yet what LAN technology was best would not be clear until standards were resolved and vendors offered standards-compliant products at affordable prices. Then, and only then, did corporate buyers feel like they were not risking their careers or their firms computing futures. When buying accelerated, LAN sales skyrocketed from $63 million in 1982 to nearly $1 billion in 1986. IBM missed out on the bonanza they had triggered. For it was not until 1986 that they began shipping their long anticipated token ring LAN. The winning technology would be the one LAN that worked and kept getting cheaper every year: Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploding LAN sales did not guarantee every competitor, or even every Ethernet supplier, success. Each firm had to make decisions as to: What LAN to sell: Ethernet, token ring, token bus, or anyone of hundreds of alternatives; What LAN protocol to support: XNS, TCP/IP, OSI, MAP/TOP, or some proprietary incarnation; Which market to focus on: the office, the factory or those needing high performance computing; What prized customers to target: IBM, AT&amp;amp;T, General Motors, General Electric, Xerox, etc; and What people to hire and promote or how to organize their enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter observes how the firms of Data Communications and Networking fared. The focus will remain on Codex, Micom, 3Com, Ungermann-Bass, and Sytek. The years 1983-1986 were ones the management of these companies and their competitors will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We begin with firms presenting at an Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons investment conference in March 1983, observe firm behavior during 1983-1984, pause for an industry overview for 1985-1986, and finish with firm behavior for the same two years. The next chapter will explore how networks of the day were not just computer networks, but voice and data networks, or wide-area network (WANs), setting the stage for the last chapter: the coming together of LANs and WANs and the emergence of Internetworking.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.1/Alex-Brown-&-Sons-Conference-March-1983/",

Their strategy: product not network oriented; and while they wanted to remain the leader in concentrators (multiplexers), they were now focusing on local connections, i.e. port selectors. Port selectors, or dataPBXs, constituted 16% of their sales and would grow at 30-50% over the next few years. Norred asserted the dataPBX was the LAN of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Wiggins, Chairman, President and CEO of Paradyne Corp.:&lt;/strong&gt; Paradyne’s mission was changing from data communications to networking. The driving force for networking was the need for information. Communications of data would become as popular as voice. Local networking was coming into promise. In response to a question, Wiggins said he did not worry about competition: product development cycles precluded that concern. (Interestingly, Wiggins did not mention the risks of the large Social Security Administration contract they had recently won - a contract soon to turn into a nightmare.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edward Botwinick, President and CEO of Timeplex, Inc.:&lt;/strong&gt; Timeplex’s market was private, distributed data networks. The three laws of data communications were: networks never get smaller, slower, nor remain the same. Timeplex’s most important product was the Evolution II, a switching multiplexer, also known as a port selector or dataPBX. He outlined how it was leading Timeplex into large system orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ken Oshmann, President Rolm Corp.:&lt;/strong&gt;  Rolm was the largest supplier of digital PBXs (CBXs) in the world. AT&amp;amp;T and IBM were their competitors. Rolm delivered integrated voice data switching. Data could be switched at 19,200 bps: today’s need!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ralph Ungermann, President and CEO, Ungermann-Bass, Inc.:&lt;/strong&gt; Ungermann-Bass was in the communications system market selling LAN products. The market in 1984 would be $386 million. The three technological issues for LANs were: baseband vs. broadband; CSMA/CD vs. token passing; and rings vs. buses vs. stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Pliner, President, Sytek, Inc.:&lt;/strong&gt; Sytek’s competition was Ungermann-Bass. Their LocalNet LAN was a broadband LAN as was their MetroNet introduced in 1982. Their strategy: provide turnkey network/data communication solutions. (They used Paradyne modems and multiplexers when needed.) Pliner believed that once they reached $25 million in revenue, Sytek would go public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Networking remained caught in the confusion between what technology best served the needs of computer communications: LANs or PBXs. The year ahead would see a steady flow of articles extolling which technology was better. Few saw the profound effect the personal computer revolution would have on the needs of the ultimate communication system. PBX companies would continue to introduce CBXs;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; all kinds of products would be introduced so CBXs could support data devices; new start-ups like CXC and Ztel, along with computer company Datapoint, would announce CBXs with integrated LANs;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; PBX companies would announce technologies to interface to minicomputers;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and workstations integrating voice and data would be announced.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; In all, no consensus was clear as vendors attempted to stake out market leadership with press releases and product announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how prescient was the investment thesis of Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons? Mixed, with the share prices of most companies markedly lower. (See Exhibit 12.1.2 Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons Table of Performance) Ungermann-Bass would float its IPO and IBM purchased 15% of Rolm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1212-alex-brown--sons-table-of-performance&quot;&gt;Exhibit 12.1.2 Alex.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;1983 began hopefully for 3Com. In 1982, when management decided to abandon their existing channels of distribution in favor of selling their new personal computer LAN (EtherSeries) through computer retail stores, they knew their success depended on a rapid growth in the number of computer stores. In January 1983, a new venture capital backed start-up, Businessland, announced plans to launch a chain of computer retail stores. Fortuitously, Robert Metcalfe knew one of the board members, Enzo Torresi, from his days of consulting to Olivetti. Torresi arranged a meeting between Metcalfe and Dave Norman, the President. Businessland quickly became an important reseller of EtherSeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales for fiscal year ending May 1983 soared 162% to $4.7 million. 3Com earned a small profit of $15,000. In June, management strengthened its balance sheet by raising $3.6 million of venture capital, with a post-money valuation of $41 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1983, two propitious events in the economic history of LAN protocols occurred with scarcely any public notice. Xerox announced it would not release any more of the higher-layer, or higher-level, protocols of XNS. Yogen Dalal, who had managed XNS into existence when he worked for Xerox PARC and had left Xerox with David Liddle to form a new company, Metaphor, remembers that Xerox was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;hesitant to send out the filing protocol, the printing protocol, the name look-up protocol, the electronic mail protocol; all the protocols that you really needed to do something. Again, I think they felt the lower-level protocols were ok to send out so that the Bridge’s and the Ungermann-Bass’s could build connectivity hardware, but nobody could really build servers that would compete with Star or the filing systems that Xerox was producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com had embedded XNS in EtherSeries and had certainly hoped the higher-level protocols would become available. Time would show, however, that 3Com had the expertise to overcome this potential problem and even transform it into an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second LAN protocol announcement, in August, would prove even more far reaching. The University of California, Berkeley released version 4.2BSD of the UNIX operating system. This version incorporated the TCP/IP code optimized by Bill Joy under contract from DARPA. Code rewritten with Ethernet in mind. Within eighteen months, over 1,000 licenses had been signed. Companies that licensed 4.2BSD received the source code for TCP/IP. No longer did firms need to start from scratch to create TCP/IP for their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again 3Com had an advantage. They had been shipping TCP products from inception and, although they had decided to stop innovating their TCP bus-based products in favor of EtherSeries, they retained considerable TCP/IP competence and know-how. So much so that a joint development agreement was executed in the fall of 1983 with Bridge Communications. 3Com would OEM their Multibus/TCP product to Bridge for use in a terminal server. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We licensed Multibus and TCP for their terminal servers. So they became another OEM of ours, and we did some technology sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1983, 3Com executed an OEM agreement with Texas Instruments. Although called an OEM agreement, it was really a sale of 3Com EtherSeries products for Texas Instrument’s internal use. Soon agreements were signed with Entre Computer Centers, Computercraft and even a service agreement with Xerox.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1983, Businessweek ran a cover story: Personal Computers: and the Winner is IBM.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  The article quoted a respected market analyst, Michele Preston of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Tobin: “The biggest surprise is how quickly, and to what extent, IBM has become so dominant.” Over 150 companies had entered the fast growing market. Sales for personal computers doubled in 1982 to $2.6 billion and were expected to rise to $4.3 billion in 1983. The article claimed IBM was buying enough parts to build 2 million personal computers for the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly the decision by 3Com’s management to focus on personal computer Ethernet LANs and, specifically those for the IBM PC, had turned into more than a hoped for success. Yet the growth in the PC market also brought competition, not only for network adaptors, such as dozens of Ethernet competitors, but also for new ideas as to how to make LAN-connected PCs more functional. The firm that would cause the most trouble for 3Com would be Novell, a company that focused on selling not LAN adapters or servers, but a LAN operating system that made LANs more functional and easier to use. Soon the value of LANs would be more than the cost-savings of sharing printers and disks, but applications like email and network applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By November 1983, the success of 3Com’s EtherSeries product family could be read in their financials. Sales for the six months ended November 1983 were $6.2 million, a 234% increase over 1982. Net income leaped to $910 thousand, up from only $72 thousand. Sales of EtherSeries network adaptors and software accounted for 44% of sales. OEM sales to Sun Microsystems, however, remained a meaningful 12% of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, 1984, the financial success of 3Com led to their Initial Public Offering (IPO). While not the first of the LAN companies to go public - that honor would go to Ungermann-Bass - 3Com would raise $12.8 million of needed capital with a post-money valuation of $80 million. Their rapid sales growth continued, with sales for the six months November 1984 totaling $22.1 million, a 251% increase over 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com invested money raised from their IPO into developing new network adaptor products, a new EtherShare network server based on an IBM PC, and software giving their networks advantages over those supplied by competitors. Their evolving strategy had roots not only in the original vision of Metcalfe and his experiences at Xerox PARC, but also the success of SUN Microsystems, a customer riding the need for high-performance network servers, especially for engineering applications. 3Com followed their lead but focused on personal computer LANs, especially IBM-compatible PC LANs.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The management of Ungermann-Bass faced the same challenges as 3Com going into 1983. And more. For Ungermann-Bass had adopted a vendor-independent strategy that encompassed more than Ethernet. Even so, Ethernet competition, the announcements of Xerox and Berkeley, and how to react to the personal computer phenomenon added to management’s woes and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1983 began with the formal acquisition of Amdax, the source of the token ring technology needed to satisfy their IBM contract.  Charlie Bass remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amdax was really three companies. It was a modem manufacturer in Long Beach, a token ring outfit in Boca Raton, and a software group in southern California. So we shut down southern California. We turned the Long Beach manufacturing group into our broadband manufacturing, and I took over the engineering group, fired the head of that group, and handed them the proposal we had given IBM, and said:  “OK guys, this is the job.  This is what we have to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the year unfolded, UB felt the competitive pressure from the new entrant Bridge Communications. Ralph Ungermann remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we started the company we chose the Z-80 as our architecture because of our experience with the Z-80 and the fact that the Z-80 had the best communication capability. That turned out to be our Achilles Heel, because Zilog wasn’t successful, and therefore we ended up having to change architectures to Intel, and that’s how Bridge Communications got started. They recognized that we had a big transition, and they jumped on a 16-bit processor and went around and said: ‘See, they’re the pioneers, but we’ve got the real advanced technology and higher performance and everything,’ and they got a start by getting a jump on us on that second generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That it was Bridge Communications, and not some unfamiliar company, invoked past emotions. Again Ungermann:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were up here fighting this broad-based battle with this broad product line against IBM and DEC, and then there was the way Bridge got started, really, it caused some real animosity, and there was some tremendous hatred towards Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;UB not only faced the growing head-to-head competition with Bridge Communications but also the lack of a solution to the problems of interconnecting personal computers. Jim Jordan, vice president of sales and marketing, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The PC started to be a big deal and it started to get very evident to everybody that if you’re going to be in networking, you really had to get into PC networking as part of what you’re doing.  Maybe that’s the main strategy, maybe not, but it certainly had to encompass that. I was going crazy, because we were starting to get hurt in the sales area, because we really didn’t really have any network installations for PCs, and it was becoming obvious that they were becoming ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Three guys really ran the company: Charlie, Ralph and I. I wanted to get into it, and I wanted to get into it very badly, and also with a solution similar to the kind of solution that 3Com had, which was as low a cost network interface card for the PC as you could design; no real intelligence on it, and keep the price down as much as you can. That was what I wanted to do. Charlie also thought we should get into the PC networking business, but he said you shouldn’t do it that way. You should build this 186 based board with a whole bunch of memory, and you should off-load all the networking overhead onto this board; take it off the PC, put it on the board, run all your own protocols on it, and cost isn’t really a major issue: typical goddamned engineer approach to the problem. And Ralph didn’t want to get into the business at all. Ralph thought that Ungermann-Bass should not be in the PC networking business at all. The three of us rented a hotel room and spent all day in it arguing about this and trying to work out internal company issues, but this was the main topic.  Ralph didn’t want to do it, period. And I’m saying: How can you be a general purpose networking company if you don’t have a PC solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Ralph went to Europe, and Charlie and I got us in the business while he was gone. We absolutely did. We started designing one of these things, and made a commitment with TI. They had, I think, signed a letter of intent with 3Com, and we gave them a technical pitch and said: “We’re going to get into the business. Here’s why our solution is better than 3Com’s, because we’re going to put some memory in and blah, blah, blah…’ and that was when TI was really getting into the PC business, so they called up 3Com and cancelled and signed a deal with us. We took it away from 3Com. We had an OEM deal with TI, and Ralph comes back from Europe and went crazy. It’s the best thing that ever happened to the goddamned company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bass remembers the problem of implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the midst of this, I’m trying to figure out: ‘Can you even get an Intel 186 microprocessor? What’s it going to cost?’ This was at a time when they were on allocation. So I go to Bill Davidow [vice president of Intel], got down on my hands and knees, and said: ‘Please sell us 186’s.’ Bill just played me like a flute. ‘Well, you don’t know, how many do you really think you can sell?’ And this was coincident with 20 companies in the personal computer business – PC business – all claiming 20 percent market share, and forecasting to Intel how many they needed to maintain their 20 percent market share. ‘I need 1,000, and I’ll pay anything, Bill, as long as I can meet TI’s cost, which I couldn’t.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers did not see these internal dramas. They saw the leading company in networking, a market of unlimited potential driven by the growing use of computers. On June 23, 1983, UB became a public company, raising $28.5 million of cash with a valuation of $288 million – roughly half the value of Micom! Far cry from the start-up begging for investors three years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Bass, in one of his frequent trips to Raleigh to manage the IBM token ring-to-broadband product, learned from Dan Warmenhoven that Roger Smith, President of General Motors, has been pressuring John F. Akers, President of IBM, to implement a protocol for LANs being developed by General Motors called MAP for Manufacturing Automation Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here I am going to Raleigh regularly, talking to Dan and he starts telling me these stories about Roger Smith calling Akers and telling him: “You’re going to do MAP, or we’re tossing you out, because DEC’s going to do MAP, and if you guys don’t do MAP, you’re not going to do business with General Motors.” And I’m sitting there saying: “Holy shit!  This is important. I should pay attention. This is going to happen.” So I start telling Ralph we got to do MAP – that IBM is going to do it, and General Motors is serious about this, Boeing is serious about this. This is really going to happen. So I had a product manager working for me do a business plan, to do a MAP business unit, and we did everything from budgets to site analysis. We were trying to figure out ‘should it be in Austin or Raleigh or where should it be?’ We, at this point, had such a distributed company already, it wasn’t a problem making it more distributed. So we do this business plan and Ralph and Jordan, they’re a little skeptical. I pretty much had Ralph convinced that it made sense. I wanted to do it organically, meaning we would finance it modestly until it started generating some revenues and we could grow the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;UB finished their fiscal year with sales of $25.4 million and profits of $1.9 million. Ungermann and Jordan, however, with vastly larger visions for the company, wanted to grow much faster. Undoubtedly the conversations they had been having with Bass had had an effect, for as Jordan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ralph and I thought the token bus or MAP market was going to be large. I think everybody did at the time. This was early 1984. We decided we wanted to get into it. Concord Data Systems was the only player in it at the time. We felt pretty strongly that their strategy wasn’t that good, because it was very box oriented, and we thought it was a board business. Concord was selling boxes and that was not what you needed in the factory. And they only operated at five megabits, they weren’t ten megabits per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem was funding the R&amp;amp;D. We wanted to get into it, but here was a whole other development effort, a whole other level of technology, a whole other level of expense. We couldn’t support it from current operations for it would drive our profits down. So we said: “How can we do this?” Well, we could do a R&amp;amp;D partnership. That was one way we could do it. We could do – how about a joint venture company? We both really favored the joint venture company for a couple of reasons. One, we could put the technology in, they would put in the money, but the thing that really made it appealing was if we could do it with the right partner, the thought was that it would lend a lot of credibility. If you go to General Motors and say: “We’re Ungermann-Bass. We’re doing $100 million in sales. You ought to put your whole Saturn plant on our neat technology.” Not too persuasive an argument. But if you go there and you say:” We’ve got this company and GE owns half of it, and GE is standing behind it, you ought to put your Saturn plant on this technology,” it makes a lot better argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we put the proposal together and we went to the Board of Directors. We had a list of three or four companies. GE was the first one on the list. We said: “We’re going to propose to them that we start this company. We want $6 million from them, we’ll give them 40% of the company, we’ll take 60% – keep 60% at Ungermann-Bass. We’ll put in the technology, we’ll manage it, we’ll come out with MAP products.” The board said: “Great,” but they kind of laughed and said: “Good Luck. I’m sure GE’s going to give you $6 million for 40% of this make-believe company,” right? We went to GE in June of ‘84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this same period, the spring of 1984, UB signed a $15 million OEM contract with Codex. The terms of the contract gave Codex a warrant to purchase 654,000 shares of UB common stock at an average exercise price of $15.30. (Signifying a very important contract to both firms.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing all of the technology choices and implementations of their vendor-independent LAN strategy kept UB management in turmoil, whether due to: competition, the decision of Xerox to withhold higher-layers of XNS, personal computers or IBM’s contract changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition with Bridge Communications forced UB to upgrade their products to 16/32 bit microprocessors: if had not been Bridge Communications, it would have been some other firm or simply the need to provide more product functionality. UB began shipping Network Interface Units (NIUs) using the Intel 80186 and Motorola M68000 beginning that third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision of Xerox to not release the higher-layers of the XNS protocol did not have an immediate impact on UB. However, by mid-1984, a decision to convert to TCP/IP or the emerging OSI standard was required. Bass, head of engineering and responsible for the final decision, was very familiar with TCP/IP and had been giving talks on the coming importance of OSI. But maybe most importantly, he had been hearing of how GM had been putting pressure on IBM to support the MAP/OSI protocol stack. Bass opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, the confusing factor was OSI. I mean – and here’s where I made a huge judgment mistake in gauging the potential importance of OSI. It was one of the biggest flaws in my crystal ball ever. And that’s why I think it’s one of the things that delayed TCP/IP and Ungermann-Bass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ungermann, who was intimately involved in pitching the MAP project to GE, also recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We made a huge bet on OSI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 16-bit NIUs conformed to the bottom five layers of the OSI protocol.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the efforts to develop a personal computer product encountered problems: problems both technical and political. At the root laid the clash between Bass and Jordan as how best to design a PC product. John Davidson remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There were many interactions between marketing and engineering that would probably help paint the picture of the relationship between Jim and Charlie. Jim Jordan and his marketing people would come to a meeting and say: “Well, look, we need this set of features,” and Charlie and his engineering team would say: “Ok, we’ll get back to you and tell you what we can do.” And the next meeting they’d come back and the schedule was enormous and couldn’t meet the needs of the marketing guys for timing, so they’d say: “Well, then, could you do this?” And they’d go away again and come back with another long schedule. This, I think, began to be a problem for the company, certainly a problem for the individuals. One of the questions had been:  “Could you put your software inside the PC so that it would run with the dumb card?” And the answer came back:  “Yes, but it will take us a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally in late 1984, a year after signing their contract with TI, UB introduced its PC product: the Net/One Personal Connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of these technical turbulences, IBM decided to cancel its contract with UB. Bass remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We then suffered from IBM management turnover. In 18 months, we went through three generations of management in Raleigh, and each time they would come in, they would reevaluate, they would re-spec, and affect the project dramatically. The first generation was Murray Bolt. The second generation was Dan Warmenhoven, and the third generation shut it down. They looked and, based on the cost projections, delivery times, they said: “Discontinue.’ This was really my swan song with Ungermann-Bass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 10, 1984, in a big press announcement, UB and GE announced a joint venture: Industrial Networking Inc. (INI). UB contributed technology and management for 60% of the voting stock and GE contributed $2 million in cash and $4 million in notes for 40% of the voting stock. Losses in the joint venture were to be absorbed by GE. Jordan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We went to GE in June, signed the papers in October, cashed the check. Did the whole deal in about four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the end of the year, Ungermann elevated both Jordan and Bass to the positions of Executive Vice President. Only Jordan ended up with all the responsibilities and Bass with none. Bass soon resigned, although continuing as Vice Chairman of the Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UB finished another record fiscal year. Sales grew 106% to $52 million and profits rose to $6.8 million up from only $.5 million in 1983. Codex accounted for 12% of sales and INI 6%.  UB seemed to be clicking in all gears As Ungermann would say in the Annual Report dated February 27, 1985: “1985 promises to be most rewarding for Ungermann-Bass.”&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Michael Pliner, President of Sytek, had every reason to feel confident that his company’s strategy of selling broadband networks into large campus networks both unique and destined to succeed. With engineering focused on demonstrating a metropolitan-wide network for his corporate investor, General Instruments (GI), Sytek’s direction seemed set. That was until he gave a talk at Brown University in the spring of 1983. Pliner remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We expected 90 people to show up; 200 people showed up. Hot, spring night. And, so we were all crammed in this room and about 12 IBM representatives were there including Jim Turner from Entry Systems Division. And we had customers talk, and he looked at this technology and he said, “This is fantastic, we can put IBM PCs on campus-wide networks, Metropolitan-Networks.” They bought into the same thing that GI kind of said, carry video, multi-media, put it all in the same network. So, ESD [Entry Systems Division] got really interested in broadband.  And, they had a good team and they were really riding the success of the PC, you know, because the PC was invented there. Estridge was still there, they were king of the roads. They could do anything they wanted. They were mavericks. They came to us and said, ‘We like this broadband stuff, and we like that product that you had trouble with, LocalNet 40.’ ‘I don’t know if we could do that, [create LocalNet40 for the PC]’ I said, ‘and, furthermore, we don’t think we can meet your price point,’ because the price point they wanted was for the PC. I said, “Why don’t you go talk to Ungermann-Bass, they can do that with Ethernet.”  And, they did but they kept coming back and said, ‘No, we want broadband. We gotta be able to go on campus networks.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we said, ‘Ok, this is a risk-taking company — are we gonna do this thing and take this great idea and deal off the table or are we gonna pass on it, because they really want our product and they’re willing to pay more for it?’ So we went and did it, and we knew that when we signed up to do that deal, we knew that there was only 60-40 shot we would ever make it, ok, because we were doing things that were just never done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pliner quickly redirected most of Sytek’s engineering resources to developing a broadband product for IBM. Fortunately most of the effort required to demonstrate the metropolitan network had been completed. Pliner remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We actually demonstrated in Sacramento interactive cable TV on a Metropolitan-Network. I mean you’re talking about a thousand or $1500 for a box that was going to sit in front of your TV that would allow you to interact with a terminal. People weren’t going to pay the money necessary for cable companies to get their money back out in order to make a profit. We were too early and it just wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why GI invested in us and that’s why we let the investment happen, because we looked for that. And that was the end of Metropolitan-Networking for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment from GI may have failed to materialize a viable metropolitan network, but the GI manufacturing plant in Mexico looked like the solution to achieve the aggressive cost target for the IBM product. However, a four-month development overrun before prototypes were finished complicated the handoff of a difficult to manufacture high-technology product to the GI facility.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;  With a product introduction scheduled for August, IBM expressed concern whether they would have enough initial inventories to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 8, 1984, IBM announced both their IBM Cabling System and intention to implement a “star-wired token ring local area network using the IBM Cabling System within the next two to three years.” Sytek management did not react with alarm to the idea of IBM selling a token ring LAN given IBM’s management expression of commitment to “their” PC LAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 14, 1984, IBM finally announced its LAN. Only it was the PC LAN, the reengineered Sytek LocalNet. What would be telling in the specifications was that it limited the number of stations to 72, when the compelling advantage for broadband came into play with a large number of stations. Pliner remembers the enormity of getting ready for the PC LAN introduction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So when IBM came out with the PC LAN, it was three boards shrunk down to one and we were able to manufacture it, and before we even announced the product, we had manufactured 14,000 of them, and we filled up the IBM distribution channel. So it was a good relationship at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, IBM invested $6 million for 4.9% of Sytek, valuing Sytek at over $120 million. Even the difficulties of manufacturing product in Mexico did not seem to dampen their relationship. Pliner recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We TRIED to manufacture in Mexico. We never successfully did that. We said: ‘This is too high tech of a product. It cannot be manufactured in Mexico,’ and moved it back and we set it up here, and we had an excellent, high quality manufacturing plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news continued. In December 1984, Sytek signed an agreement with DEC under which they the two companies would market each other’s products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Pliner had promised at the Alex. Brown conference, he began discussions with investment bankers to go public.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Paul Severino, President of Interlan, knew growing revenues required more than selling Ethernet controllers facilitating computer-to-computer connections. Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was just when the Intel chip set was starting to become available, we decided that what we should try to do next is that terminal stuff, and we thought that would give us a niche in the marketplace that the Ungermann-Bass and Bridge Communications really didn’t have, which was host-to-host plus terminal-to-host access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the priority given to producing a low cost product, Interlan introduced a very competitive terminal server in August 1983. Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ralph [Ungermann] was doing broadband by that time. Bridge [Bridge Communications] was going in that direction. And they also were going in to solve a lot more of the terminal connect problems. All we were interested in was asynchronous terminals. We had no other protocols. We had no synchronous. We did a very small box, eight ports, no disk in it or anything. It was very cheap. We made it cheap, low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Interlan began selling their terminal server, three issues arose that necessitated considerable effort and expense: offering LAN protocols, creating a personal computer product, and building a direct sales organization. Severino remembers the difficult decision of LAN protocols:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We wanted TCP/IP. We just kept putting it off. Then we tried to get XNS. What we did was, we went to Xerox and Xerox finally let us have the filing protocols. And my feeling was that if we can get the filing protocols, then we could start to provide this multi‑vendor file transfer capability. So what we did was, instead of going back and implementing TCP, which is a transport layers thing, we went up to the filing protocols on XNS. And it was just difficult because we said:  “Gee, we’ve got to add value here. Let’s get the file transfer stuff put together between UNIX,” and the idea was UNIX, VMS and MS‑DOS, those three. So you had a system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Interlan had revenue of $6.7 million, up 180%, with a small profit of $154 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1984, management turned their attention to creating a personal computer Ethernet controller. Creating a PC product, however, proved as challenging as creating host controllers. Announced in mid-1984, the Net/Plus did not ship until November 1984. [10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a PC product to sell, it was time to begin building a direct sales organization and to phase down their use of manufacturers representatives. Only creating the direct sales force required something which Interlan had little of: cash. Severino laments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We just didn’t have the resources. I mean, the thing about Interlan that was so much different from the other LAN companies is we hardly raised any money, compared to everybody else. I mean our total amount of venture capital from the very beginning was $5 million, total. So as a result we didn’t have the dollars and the resources that were being thrown at the problem from some of the other vendors, but we did very well. We always made our numbers and we were profitable. We had been starting to build a direct sales organization, and we sort of needed more time on the sales organization to prove that it could be productive. What we had built in the past was OEMs with reps, and we needed a little more time on the direct sales organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1984, the board of directors considered the option of going public to raise the needed cash, but as Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the fall of ‘84, we had no cash and we actually had a little debt, so we just needed to have cash in the door, and we just could not grow the business the way we thought we could grow it without having cash in the door. And we just didn’t feel that the company was really ready to go out to the public markets. My feeling is that if I were to take the company public, I’d have to feel very, very strongly that I’m going to make all the numbers I’m talking about. I just don’t want to get into a situation where you’re selling stock and not getting there. It’s not the kind of way I like to do business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next obvious solution was to sell the company, so Interlan retained the investment bank, Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons, to find a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In January 1983, Bridge Communications raised $3 million from venture capitalists with a post-money valuation of $11 million, up 200% from the valuation of February 1981. Now shipping their terminal server, they faced two primary sources of competition: dataPBXs and Ungermann-Bass. Judith Estrin remembers selling against dataPBXs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the first two years, we had like a five to one price differential, so there you sold to the people who were not bottom line conscious, but who were productivity conscious, making decisions based on productivity. We had features and sex appeal galore in the product: modularity of growth; the software features; the distribution; we had a whole list of things that you could do with this product that you couldn’t do with a data PBX, even though the function, the black box function, was the same. It wasn’t until three years into the company, as costs came down, that we were really able to go in and not only compete on a productivity, but on a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competing against Ungermann-Bass was different as Bill Carrico recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s funny because one of the ways that Bridge got beat up in the early years was Ungermann-Bass had broadband; again a non-standard broadband. We got beat up because Ungermann-Bass would use that to beat us up because that was the best lever they had. Our product, overall, was superior, but we didn’t have broadband, so they emphasized broadband, which is pretty typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the cash raised from the financing, management began engineering a broadband product. They also had to solve the problem created by Xerox withholding the higher-layers of XNS. Acting quickly, they did a TCP/IP and Multibus technology transfer and license agreement with 3Com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 1983, revenue was $3.2 million and the loss was $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1984, LAN protocols become even more of an issue. Carrico remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was probably ‘84 that TCP/IP started to creep up to higher visibility in the marketplace, and people were starting to use TCP/IP more visibly, and that’s what prompted us then to go implement TCP/IP, and put it in the terminal servers and gateways and so on. TCP/IP then just slowly, completely encroached on XNS because it was standard, even though, with our very best implementation, it’s still half the performance of XNS on the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1984, Bridge Communications announced a joint development and OEM agreement with Contel Information Systems under which Contel, a subsidiary of Contel Information Systems, would OEM $10 million of product over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 1984, Ungermann-Bass finally introduced their 16/32 bit products, Estrin opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ungermann-Bass refused to acknowledge that we were going to be a serious competitor. For two and a half years after we started they didn’t come out with a new software release. We had all these more advanced features. They thought: “We don’t need to worry about Bridge.” They kind of went about their own way, and by the time they stopped and said: “Uh, oh,” it was too late. That’s what happened with the data PBX guys too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 1984, revenues soared to $13.4 million, up 319%. A small operating loss resulted but net income totaled $.5 million due to the use of tax loss carry-forwards and interest income.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.7/Concord-Data-Systems/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Ken Miller knew he had a serious competitor when Ungermann-Bass (UB) acquired Amdax Corporation on January 1, 1983. Miller had worked closely with Amdax management to bring into being a token bus LAN standard. Miller remembers when the token bus technical specification was finalized for voting in 1983:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in getting token bus passed, so great, holy shit, a little company pushed that through. We pretty much wrote the standard. The other company that participated was Amdax, another token bus start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Token bus was now inevitable. Concord Data Systems (CDS) no longer had to wait for a standard to be voted on before starting product development, confident that the standard would not be changed before being finalized.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  Soon the problem became missed engineering schedules and commitments. Creating a token bus controller proved more difficult than projected and, by mid-year, CDS still had no saleable product. Miller recalls that maybe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;we did not keep the pressure on the LAN engineers with our focus on getting a standard passed. In any case, the product wasn’t finished. It kept having delays. The RF modem was a problem because we couldn’t get people. Then to do even a terminal server, we said: ‘Hey we had to do the upper layer, so we thought it’s going OSI.’ You couldn’t buy OSI layers so we ended up doing our own transport layer, which was a whole shit load of work! We were naive and cocky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller’s earlier opinion that local area networking was a data communication problem, not a computer problem, seemed open to question. In any case, CDS found token bus to be much more challenging than dial-up modems, the other category of products they were innovating and selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 1983 progressed, it became obvious that they had to improve the performance and reduce the costs of their token bus implementation. The solution required VLSI semiconductor technology to reduce the functionality embodied in dozens of chips and, hence, printed circuit board space, into one or two chips. CDS began interviewing semiconductor foundries to both design and fabricate the chips. Management visited Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Signetics, Western Digital, and AMI, a division of Gould. Not surprisingly, given Miller’s long association with Gould, they selected AMI. Once their custom chips became available, hopefully in a year, management believed their products would be superior to those of their competitors. They assigned Phinney the responsibility to manage the project out of Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more immediate need, however, was generating revenues and cash. CDS had adopted an OEM sales strategy using manufacturers representatives. An important advantage of this strategy was only a few large customers would have to be supported, not many small ones. A disadvantage, however, was that CDS had little, if any, contact with the ultimate buyers. Competing for the limited number of known OEM customers were: UB (with Amdax), Interactive Systems (a start-up now part of 3M), and even Sytek. When Phillips became their first OEM, confidence surged and an intensified effort was made to convince General Electric (GE) to switch from Ethernet to token bus. Then in mid-1983, they received a call from General Motors (GM). Miller recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They said they had this MAP [Manufacturing Automation Protocol] project. They had been talking to Interactive Systems. They had been talking to Allen Bradley about this. They said: ‘Hey, you guys are furthest along. We want token bus. We’ve already selected 802.4 to be the lower two layers of MAP. We want to tie this thing together in the factory. So we want this multi-vendor demonstration to happen at the NCC [National Computer Conference] show in the summer of 1984.’ Well we couldn’t pass that up. Here’s the big corporate presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller remembers that “we hadn’t finished our terminal server product,” and to satisfy GM, “we diverted resources.” But they rationalized: GM was worth it. If they could just pull this off, they would be uncontested market leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Miller did not have to wonder about their modem business, for it basically kept getting better and better. When they introduced their new V.22bis 2400 bps modem, it proved to be all Miller had promised:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1983, we came out with an auto-dial version, and it’s really the auto-dial version that’s like a Classic Coke product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of their increasing market presence, Roger Evans of Micom visited Miller expressing interest in OEMing dial-up modems from CDS. Miller remembers Evans wondering: “Why are you trying to build a LAN business?” Miller turned down Evans’ query to buy modems, just as he had earlier declined Bass’s overture to OEM RF modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 1983, CDS finally completed development of its token bus controller, the TIM, or Token Interface Module.  It connected factory floor devices to token bus through the V.35 interface. Unfortunately, it did not support the RS-232 interface, and, therefore, could not be used as a terminal server. CDS also implemented the lower layers of the MAP protocols in the TIM as specified in the first draft of the proposed MAP standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having a token bus terminal server proved a problem, a serious problem. Customers wanted to buy terminal servers, not the V.35 interface controller CDS was selling. It wasn’t that CDS didn’t know they needed a terminal server for one was in development. It was just that their limited engineering resources had been diverted to supporting GM for NCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their token bus TIM generating minimal revenues, let alone profits, Miller had little choice but to raise more capital. Some argued CDS should go public, after all LAN companies were hot and CDS had a convincing story to tell: they were the token bus market leaders. Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I said: ‘ Geez, you know, LAN really isn’t launched. You know, I think we really ought to get our act together and have both sides of the business humming.’ I mean, you go to do a public offering and that can be very diverting. So, I went on the road. It was similar  – the guy was telling me it was very similar to a public offering. I went on a road show. I went to Europe. To a whole bunch of cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller traveled most of June selling a $5 million private placement. Investors, however, were unwilling to commit until the NCC show proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At NCC, CDS provided the token bus controllers show participants needed to connect to the shared token bus LAN. It seemed to matter little that the connections were via an external box, not an internal bus-based controller, token bus worked. Concord Data Systems was a hit of the show. Miller easily remembers that the:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;show was euphoric. Unbelievable show. There was us, little us, you know, with only – I mean they were all billion dollar plus companies and there was a big press conference: the first hoopla about MAP. It was a real splash. There were only seven vendors at the time: ourselves, DEC, IBM, Allen Bradley, Gould, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard. We were on top of the world! One of our potential investors was at the press conference. He signed up for more after the press conference. We raised $7 million; two more than we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $7 million financing closed in June 1984. CDS was valued at $34 million. Not bad considering only two years earlier the company’s value was $8 million. But why shouldn’t the value of their shares increase? They were working with GM, easily the largest potential token bus customer. DEC and Allen Bradley would soon be OEM’s. There were only two clouds on the horizon: first, IBM was not focusing on the token bus opportunity the way they “should be,” but they had been a ‘bluebird,’ a long shot, all along anyway. The second problem portended to be more serious. Phone calls to GE were not being returned. Even requests for meetings with GE personnel were being deferred. GE had to be converted to token bus and drop their Ethernet efforts. By delaying all they were doing was missing sales, and the opportunity to be a significant token bus player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1984, CDS management felt like they were “on top of the world!.” For the fiscal year ending September 1984, budgeted revenues of $12 million had been surpassed. Revenues totaled $15.5 million with marginal profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDS entered their 1985 fiscal year an organization filled with confidence. Now only to win the GM contract in the spring. But problems soon arose. They couldn’t come out with the desired second generation V.22bis modem. Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There weren’t enough resources in modem engineering. It was sort of getting sucked up in LAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As important as the modem issues were, in the fall of 1984, CDS management had an even more significant problem. On October 10, a thunderclap echoed through the halls and offices of CDS, stunning management with the news that UB and GE had formed a joint venture, Industrial Networks Inc. (INI), to compete in the MAP-token bus market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again Miller rationalized:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OK, they got a lot of money but, holy shit, we’ve been working on this thing forever!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

In March 1983, DEC began shipping its first Ethernet controller for their Unibus (DEUNA).

So we focused on TCP/IP with an Ethernet board. We signed up just about everybody, everybody except Apollo and Sun.

Revenues were $5.2 million with a loss of $2.4 million. R&amp;amp;D costs totaled $2.1 million, 40% of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of eager investors wanting to invest in LAN companies, in November 1984, they sold a fourth round of preferred stock, raising $3.2 million, with a post-money valuation of $17 million.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

John Pugh remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We got him in to head up the LAN business, and he was also heading up the PBX business and a couple of other ideas. What he essentially brought to Codex at that time was IBM thinking. And he had been high enough up in IBM so he knew all the things that IBM had been thinking about and was spending some money on. So he was pushing essentially three things: the LAN, which we had already signed up to, and that’s what we hired him in for, teleconferencing, and PBX. And Motorola really felt they wanted to be in the PBX business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolt began staffing his organization and learning his way around Codex. The PBX opportunity seemed a sure bet given Motorola’s encouragement and all the preparatory work that had been done. Pugh remembers the decision of Art Carr, the Motorola VP responsible for Codex and once its president:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After we’d gone through all of these massive studies on it [the PBX business], and even lined up potential deals with Nixdorf and a couple of other companies, Carr said: “No way. We will not do that. I will not bring Codex into that business.”  And Motorola didn’t push him.  Motorola said: “Okay. Then we won’t do it.” Which was one of our better decisions, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis shifted to entering the LAN business. But to do so required hiring the right people. Again Pugh recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bolt came in and he had to build up fast. He was staffing up fast. So he went to all parts of the company, and he pulled people in. And these people had no expertise in the LAN business. He had hired a few outside people from the engineering standpoint that did have some experience in the LAN, but it was pretty hard to find anybody who had LAN experience. In marketing, he had no people that had LAN experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing organizational costs were soon became a concern. Carr remembers his meetings with Jim Storey, Codex’s president:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I used to have Story give me rundowns, a quarterly thing, and I was looking at his budget one day and I said: “Geez, Jim, if you look at all of these lines and you look at the operating cost as a percent of revenue, then you look at the LAN business,” and the LAN business was called an independent business unit, which was supposed to be a technique to have a lean, entrepreneurial type shop inside of a bureaucracy, his budget was bigger, and his organization chart was more elaborate, and Jim said:  “Well, these are my Codex organizations, and this is my IBM organization.” I said:  “What are you doing about that?” He said: “Well, I got to give him time. I got to give him a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under pressure to begin generating revenues and with no internally developed products on the horizon, Bolt turned to the strategy of OEMing LAN products from the firm he knew best: Ungermann-Bass. Charlie Bass remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Murray really liked us. We had done a great job for him, and he wanted to deliver Codex into the 20th century. And he came up with this great strategy of being an OEM of pretty much everything we made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-1984, Codex began selling repackaged LANs from UB.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.11/Micom/",

Their data PBX products had grown to equal nearly one-third of their sales and forced management to make significant changes to how they both innovated and sold products. Steve Frankel remembers that when he took over marketing he created mini-business units called Marketing and Development teams:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I put marketing and engineering people together, and those teams would focus on a particular marketplace, segment of the communications market. It was that strategic decision that allowed the company to create this very expensive data PBX business. Without that, the company never would have done it, because the resources would have been employed elsewhere. So, as a result of that, we grew multiple arms for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But selling the more complicated, and longer sales-cycle data PBX, required Micom to evolve their very successful rep (representative) sales organization. Again Frankel remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had enough channel strength and enough resources to find another layer of sales and supporting people to start making some real headway in that market, and then we really started evolving the data PBX into a much more capable product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Micom’s sales grew only 50% over 1982. Management rationalized the results to the continuing recessionary economy and, more importantly, to the slowdown in minicomputer sales. Fortunately the data PBX had grown to nearly a $20 million product line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the spring of 1984, however, when the sales of data PBXs slowed unexpectedly, management had to face the fact that competition for dataPBXs was changing. Frankel recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The PC, and as a result of the PC, in my view, the local area network, was really starting to come up, and right in parallel with that was a tremendous push being exerted by the voice/data PBX manufacturers. So you had this tremendous collision of evolving technology. Who would win out? Would the data PBX people sustain their market share to provide switched service or would, in fact, LANs evolve into a business, or would, in fact, the voice people take the data business? Given they already had to put a voice switch on the site, why not just add some interfaces and take the business? It was becoming clear by early ‘84 that there was a tremendous frontal attack on the data PBX business because the growth in the data PBX business was slowing down. It was still growing, but growing at a lesser rate. As we went around and talked to customers and potential customers, it became clear that their desire was, as a result of the advent of the PC, more file transfer, and a lot more desktop processing and that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Evans, Executive Vice-President, remembers the shift happening with customers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was the data PBX customer who was increasingly putting PCs on the desk where terminals had been. He was increasingly saying: ‘If you’re going to stick around, you’re going to have to provide high speed communications in your local network product. The data PBX is fine for our terminals, but not fine for PCs’ And then, in parallel with that, we have DEC essentially making their very open statement that it was going to murder the data PBX because its whole strategy was going to be based on convincing its customers that if you didn’t have a capability of taking 10 megabits to the desk, you were living in yesteryear. And all of a sudden to sell a data PBX you almost had to wear a grubby raincoat, because if a customer was going to buy a data PBX, he wore a grubby raincoat because he didn’t want anybody to recognize him doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans and Frankel began discussing what to do. Only they came to different conclusions. Frankel remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happened was Roger took his position and I took mine. We had fundamentally different opinions at that time. Roger’s view was that the company should launch a voice/data PBX product. I decided no, LANs were going to take the business. We fundamentally disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Norred, president, remembers the discussions among the three of them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was a lot of discussion about what should we do? Should we build off of the data PBX technology and direction and get into the voice business and combine the voice and data together? I know that we had some very long discussions about the voice PBX business and concluded it was just a business that we had no business being in. There were just too many obstacles, and it was also the time that the other companies were already starting to see some slowing in the growth, and we just felt we were not likely to be in a position to be a significant factor in that marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion was to see if there was a LAN company they could acquire. Frankel remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what happened then was we decided: ‘Well, it sounds like LAN is going to win out, and we better go do something about this.’ By that time Ungermann-Bass was growing nicely, and basically growing in 17 different directions, which is how they went. Bridge was in business and 3Com was too, but the strategy was to preserve and enhance the minicomputer-based market share we had, and we would then launch into PC stuff later, if it made sense, but we had to sustain the revenue stream and the profit return from the core. So Bridge was interesting, also, because, at that time, they were still using some of the reps that Micom was.  So, there was some very interesting synergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only conversations with Bridge failed to stimulate any interest. Bill Carrico, president of Bridge Communications remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We talked to the Micom guys. They came to us and said: ‘Maybe we should buy you,’ and we said: ‘No thank you.’ They have a box mentality and a hardware mentality, and the LAN business, the general purpose LAN business, was a system business; software system-sell. At Bridge, we outnumbered software engineers to hardware engineers like ten to one. It was a software business, and these guys – it was probably the inverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunities seemed limited until they received a call from Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons on a retainer to sell Interlan. Conversations progressed rapidly. Then in December 1984, Frankel left Micom for another entrepreneurial opportunity. Evans began negotiating the acquisition of Interlan.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.12/New-DataPBX-Competitors/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Those with entrepreneurial instincts had many reasons to start firms in the early 1980s: whether because it was what they always wanted to do, in their blood as they would say; or the sudden availability of venture capital and hot IPO markets; or a brilliant idea that compelled them to act; or the pervasive buzz of opportunity whether because of the personal computer, VLSI semiconductor technology, new programming languages, operating systems or applications software; or simply that their neighbors or friends or work mates had acted and they did not want to be left with nothing but envy. The need to interconnect computers and peripherals motivated all kinds of solutions and for many the cost advantage held by data PBXs over LANs seemed insurmountable. Two examples were Metapath and Equinox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;metapath&quot;&gt;Metapath&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1979, Bruce Hunt, who had introduced LAN thinking to Zilog with his Ariel network, left Zilog and entered Stanford University to pursue his Masters degree with Fouad Tobaji as his advisor. All was great, until he exhausted his savings in 1980 and needed to find work. Tobaji suggested Stanford Research Institute (SRI, one of the first four nodes of the ARPANET) and soon Hunt had a job that enabled him to stay in school. At SRI, he kept exploring extensions of CSMA/CD (Ethernet) and before long had one of those compelling ideas. Hunt talked to his brother who loaned him $20,000 to reduce his concepts to a VLSI chip. By August 1982, Hunt had built twenty prototypes using his custom chips, prototypes that made possible inexpensive interconnections among computing devices: a product they would call a desktop data switch. Then came the challenge of finding capital to finance his company’s growth. Hunt remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We started visiting venture firms and talked to a lot of people. And my brother had a friend who was working for one of Norm Dion’s start-ups, and they were interested in data communications. So we zipped on down and gave a presentation of the technology, and Bill Harry, who was Vice President of Development, says: “Well, I’d like you to meet a guy named Norm Dion.” So I said: “Great.” So that night I went home and I called Craig Johnson [Hunt’s lawyer], and said: “Have you ever heard of a man named Norm Dion?” We’re going to have a meeting with him Monday,” and Craig said: “Bruce, you’re in the big time. Don’t blow it.” That’s exactly what he said. He said: “You guys need to be really prepared. He explained Norm Dion was the founder of Dysan and Chairman and CEO. So we worked our asses off, I mean we went into overdrive. Literally, I think we slept two hours until that Monday. We did a complete presentation of the business plan. We had foils and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we go to what he called a standing meeting at, I guess, one o’clock in the afternoon. Norm wanders in about 1:45. He sits down and he introduced himself, and we gave him our presentation. He said: “Thank you very much, that was very interesting. We’ll talk to you later.” About Thursday, Bill Harry called and said:  “Could you guys come back in next Monday?” We said: “Sure.” Then on Friday he called back and cancelled. Anyway, there was two weeks of horrible ‘oh my God, they’re not interested in us.’ About two weeks later they finally asked us back, and we came in on Monday; but this time all my papers were open and on the desk. Somebody had actually read our business plan. So I figured that means they’re at least interested. Norm started to really probe me, and boy, probably the toughest interview I ever went through in my life. I was in such a state of excitement that my brain was racing like absolutely crazy. Finally, he stopped the meeting, and he says:  “Well, thank you, I think I’ve had enough,” and then he sat there, and literally, he put his head down and he started to think, and I’m sitting there and I’m saying to myself:  “My God, should I say anything? But you think I’m going to say anything now? No way! At 45 minutes he looks up and says: “I think I’m going to do the deal,” and that was it. So he said: “Let’s get going. Can you pull out a couple of those letters of intent that we did before.” He had several of them, one of which was the one he did with Al Shugart to start Seagate. What a deal! Really exciting stuff. He says: “I want you to estimate what it will take to get you to this stage, and that’s what we’ll do.” So we said: “Fine.” So that’s where the $640,000 came from. That’s the way he started the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December 1983, Hunt’s data switch, named the Robin, had proven successful and Metapath was incorporated. In January 1984, $4 million of venture capital was raised with Dion’s venture capital arm and Oak Investment Partners leading the round. (Oak had been an early investor in Ungermann-Bass and many other LAN-type companies.) That same month, Metapath introduced Robin. Sales proved difficult, however, and a down financing of $570 thousand to save the company was raised in January 1985 at one-fifth the price of the 1984 financing. For 1985, sales totaled only $700 thousand. In 1987, Metapath was acquired by Prentice, another firm struggling to cope with market changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;equinox&quot;&gt;Equinox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Dambrackas knew first hand of the computer communications opportunities. As Director of Engineering at Racal-Milgo and prior to that time with Infotron, he was aware of the success of Micom and concluded it was time to start his own company. So in February 1983, Drambrackas founded Equinox. His idea was to create a low-cost dataPBX to be sold through the same distribution channels Micom was abandoning as they converted to a direct sales organization. In December 1983, Equinox introduced their DSS-1, a data switching system capable of interconnecting 1,320 terminals and computer ports. Success came rapidly. In 1985, a financing led by Oak Investment Partners and DEC secured $3 million with a company valuation of $30 million. Equinox would be buffeted by market conditions and competition but would eventually, in 1993, become a public company.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.13/State-of-Competition-1985/",

Budgeting and strategic planning for 1985 would invariably be completed by yearend 1984. Hence market performance for 1984 could only be estimated. (Market research firms such as Dataquest - the firm whose data is being used for most of the analysis of this book – would take well into the first quarter to compile prior year data.) Then each executive had to make sense of the uncertain data available from both internal and external sources before deciding what products to develop and how best to market and position existing and new products. To reflect how fraught with risk to a firm’s very existence this process is, Exhibit 12.13.1 Product Category on the Eve of 1985 gives insight into their crystal balls and future consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-12131-product-category-analysis-on-eve-of-1985--millions&quot;&gt;Exhibit 12.13.1 Product Category Analysis on Eve of 1985 ($ Millions)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1983 Actual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984 Actual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984 Projections For 1988&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1985 Actual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1986 Actual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1988 Actual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Modems&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;918&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1,047&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,592&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1,167&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1,243&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1,262&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Statistical Multiplexers&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;245&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;289&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;919&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;303&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;319&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;194&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data PBXs&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;77&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;119&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;422&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;143&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;86&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;LANs&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;152&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;326&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,030&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;593&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;913&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2,820&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executives of Data Communication firms, those selling modems and statistical multiplexers, expected the modem market to grow from roughly $1 billion in 1983 to $1.6 billion by 1988 and statistical multiplexers to grow from just under $300 million to over $900 million. Even if these were the only products to be concerned with, no wonder Codex and Micom executives were so interested in minding their existing markets. In addition, both Codex and Micom were participating in the equally attractive Networking market with data PBXs, forecasted to grow from $119 million to $422 million by 1988. So why venture into unfamiliar technologies, such as LANs, when there was ample market growth in the product categories they were already innovating? Only the future would not turn out to be as forecasted, and the sales of statistical multiplexers and data PBXs contracted by a third from those of 1984. Having made big investment bets on either or both categories turned out to be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAN executives could expect their category sales to grow from $326 million to over $1 billion. Yet by 1988, the forecasts proved grossly wrong. LAN sales grew nearly nine times to $2.8 billion, while data PBXs, their once mighty competition, essentially died as a category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the LAN firms that consisted of over two hundred firms and many hundreds of announced products in 1983 just as suddenly collapsed to an oligopoly in 1985 with eleven firms controlling 68% of the market. (See Exhibit 10.3 Top Eleven LAN Vendors 1985). (The difference of $16 million in the total size of the LAN market in 1985 - between $593 million and $577 million - in the two exhibits were MAP sales. In 1985, INI ($8 million in revenues) and Concord Data Systems ($3.5 million) controlled the MAP market.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-12132-top-eleven-lan-vendors-1985&quot;&gt;Exhibit 12.13.2 Top Eleven LAN Vendors 1985&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar Value ($Millions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percent Market Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DEC&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$84.10&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;14.6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3COM&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;48.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;8.4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ungermann-Bass&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;39.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6.9&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;36.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6.3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Sytek&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;34.5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Network Systems Corporation&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;34.4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Excelan&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;27.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.7&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bridge Communications&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;25.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Apollo Computer&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;24.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Wang&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;19.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Interlan&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Others&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;184.6&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOTAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$576.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Dataquest December 1986, TCIS, pg. 101. Eleventh firm, Interlan added by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1985 LAN market of $577 million was subdivided into four major segments (See LAN 10.4 Market Share By Market Segment 1985): terminal servers, personal computers, computer-to-computer, and engineering workstations. Given that the personal computer segment hardly existed in 1981, it was by far the fastest growing. From the same Dataquest report, 66% of all networks were baseband: the only reason broadband accounted for 34% of the market was the shipment of the PC LAN by IBM. Ethernet, a baseband network, equaled roughly 40% of all networks sold. It was estimated that less than 7% of all terminals and 5% of all personal computers were connected to networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-12133-lan-market-share-by-market-segment-1985&quot;&gt;Exhibit 12.13.3 LAN Market Share By Market Segment 1985&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar Value ($Millions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percent Market Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Terminal Servers&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;190.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;33&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Personal Computer&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;181.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;31.5&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Computer-to-computer&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;98.6&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;17.1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Engineering Workstations&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;67.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11.6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Office Workstations&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;25.1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;13.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOTAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$576.70&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Dataquest December 1986 TCIS, pg. 23&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales of data PBXs peaked in 1985 when sales reached $143 million.

Micom faced severe tests given the coming collapse of both the statistical multiplexer and data PBX markets. Codex seemed interested in LANs but proved ineffective. Ungermann-Bass made a huge bet on MAP that was consuming resources and earning no return. 3Com was riding the success of the personal computer. Sytek, hoping to go public, depended on IBM selling the PC LAN over its token ring products. Interlan was seeking a merger partner. Bridge Communications had jumped technologically ahead of Ungermann-Bass. Concord Data Systems suffered from the slowness of MAP sales as well as the burden of riding out-dated technology. Excelan, CMC and others chased the computer-to-computer segment that comprised only 12% of the market in 1985. The big firms, DEC and IBM, were beginning to make their presences known. Not surprisingly, for at the end of 1986, there will be an estimated 100,000 computer networks.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.14/3Com/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In early 1985, the investment decisions by 3Com management in 1984 took form. In January 1985, 3Com announced the formation of a new application software division headed by Chairman Robert Metcalfe.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; The new division would focus on network-based applications, such as multi-user personal productivity tools. The intention was: to compete with the success of stand-alone software products, such as spreadsheets and word processors; to better the functionality of minicomputers; to distinguish its LAN solutions from those of other vendors and to combat the growing presence of Novell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 30, 3Com unveiled its Intel-based dedicated network servers. The 3Servers, named to reflect their three functions – peripheral sharing, information exchange and gateway access to other networks – were meant to provide minicomputer capabilities to personal computer networks. (Access meant access to other 3Com networks, however.) Bill Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were taking the next step to getting more value out of what we were selling into the proposition other than just LAN adaptor cards and software. We wanted to sell servers, and so we were looking to become the Sun of the PC market. In other words, what Sun had done for the 68000-based Unix clients and Unix servers we were going to do with DOS clients and DOS servers. So we were going to become the Sun of the DOS PC world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any misplaced confidence management may have had should have been shattered when Novell’s next-generation network operating system, Advanced NetWare/86, began shipping in June. Nevertheless Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We ignored it. We didn’t think it mattered. We thought they were dead wrong. We thought they were totally wrong, because without the applications, how could they succeed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com’s financial success continued unabated with sales of $46.3 million for fiscal year ended May 1985, up 177%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then that summer, a personal relationship between Krause and Paul C. Ely, Jr. that had ended abruptly when Krause left Hewlett-Packard for 3Com - Ely had been Krause’s superior – just as suddenly resumed. Only now Ely too had left Hewlett Packard and was in the midst of turning around the minicomputer and desktop computer company Convergent Technologies, Inc. as President. Ely was keen on making acquisitions to grow Convergent. In a fitting match, Krause and the management of 3Com had evolved a vision of workgroup computing and believed that if they could also sell the computers that populated their LAN installations they could grow a significantly larger company, just as Sun Microsystems was doing. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we’re sailing that summer again, the summer of ‘85, and I was telling him about the workgroup computing vision, and he says: “You know, at Convergent, we have exactly the same vision, only we use CTOS [their proprietary operating system]. Why don’t we merge the companies?  We’ll cash cow CTOS and we’ll build on yours. We’ll use all of our OEM relationships with Burroughs and AT&amp;amp;T and all those guys to fund really becoming the Sun of DOS. And we’ll cash cow CTOS.” Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While conversations continued in earnest, 3Com still had a company to run. In November 1985, 3Com introduced the first fruits of their software division: 3+ software. In addition to a suite of software, 3Com introduced the concept of workgroup computing: users on a LAN, or other 3Com LANs, sharing information and becoming more productive as a group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the surprise. On November 26, 1985, 3Com and Convergent announced they would merge in a transaction valuing 3Com at $133.6 million. The vision of workgroup computing, the long standing desire to sell computers, the “HP” culture within 3Com, and the intense competition from other LAN companies all combined to motivate 3Com management to buy into a larger vision made possible by the merger. It seemed to make sense and the shareholders of 3Com began giving their formal support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 20, 1986, a week before the merger seem headed for shareholder approval, Convergent announced disappointing financial results; sales were down and profits had dropped to 5 cents a share from 14 cents the previous quarter. Much of the decline was blamed on slowing sales of computers to AT&amp;amp;T. As part of the process to complete the merger, 3Com had retained its investment bankers, Robertson Colman &amp;amp; Stephens, to give an opinion on the “fairness” of the proposed valuation for 3Com. Given the drop in the profitability of Convergent, Robertson Colman &amp;amp; Stephens refused to give the needed opinion.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;  In announcing the stunning decision to cancel the merger, Krause said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s one of those unfortunate circumstances where you have an obligation to receive a fairness opinion, and if that can’t be rendered you can’t proceed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post-merger collapse period proved to be challenging. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a very difficult thing, because we really had sort of emotionally consummated the merger, and it was a very hard time for me personally, because here I had patched up things with my old mentor and was really looking forward to working with him again, and more importantly I thought we had the right vision for the industry. If that merger would have gone through, I think both companies would have been extremely successful. I was able to regroup my own emotional energy, to gather up our own internal efforts and refocus them and getting us moving down the path, sort of what I call the period of oscillation, going back and forth with ‘Should we be a workgroup computing company or Should we go back to our roots in networking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside 3Com appeared not to skip a beat, reporting sales of $48 million for the six months ended November 1986, up 73%. The robust personal computer LAN market swept them upward despite the distraction of the proposed Convergent merger.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Fiscal year 1985, foretold with promise by Ralph Ungermann in his letter to shareholders in the 1984 Annual Report, dated February 1985, turned abruptly ugly. For in March, a month later, revenues came in at $12.0 million, a skimpy 11% increase over 1984; compared to the accustomed triple digit growth of the past and what management had projected for the year. UB lost $2.1 million of operating income – losses before tax consequences. In an investor research report published by Montgomery Securities dated May 13, 1985, Ronald E. Elijah identified the reasons as production problems with broadband modems, a slowing down in the growth rate of minicomputer sales, and the lack of OEM sales. OEM sales had historically been as high as 20%. The reason: no sales of product to Codex for the last two fiscal quarters. Codex effectively disappeared as a UB customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was good news as well. INI had won the first major MAP contract, the one let by General Motors, presaging a great start for UB. A president was hired: Joe Schoendorf. Schoendorf and his new team quickly put together a sales projection of $20 million for the year and an expense plan aimed at dominating the emerging industrial LAN market of MAP and token bus. One not surprising expense was developing a VLSI token bus chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first quarter loss jolted Ungermann into making management changes. Jordan soon resigned, albeit he joined the board. Bass soon returned to do strategic marketing. Since his departure the prior fall, Bass had been consulting with IBM, working with Warmenhoven on IBM’s telecommunication strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-year, the misstep from XNS to OSI had been corrected as John Davidson recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By ‘85, we had an implementation of TCP/IP for both the PCs and terminal servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management changes and ever more new products could not overcome the financial hole generated in the first quarter. So eventhough sales for 1985 rose to $72.2 million, up 38%. a shocking operating loss of $1.9 million could not be averted. The $20 million of revenue budgeted by INI came in with at remembered $8 million with only $3.6 million of UB sales made to GE.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; Jordan opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The GM contract was a big deal. I remember the INI business plans, too. Most of it was built around GM, and the first full year of sales, INI’s business plan in revenues – and I was on the board of INI – was $20 million, and I think they did eight. But they had an expense running rate for 20, so it wasn’t working real well. They didn’t get back their expenses equal with revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;UB management clearly had problems reigning in their research and development expenses that soared to 19.2% of revenues. The cost of maintaining the breadth of products and technologies necessitated by their vendor-independent strategy was becoming prohibitive. (In contrast, for the same year, 3Com’s research and development expenses totaled only 8.2% of revenues.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1986, management, concerned with their dwindling $7.3 million of cash, sold $34.5 million of Convertible Subordinated Debentures in a public underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial burden of supporting so many technologies persisted into 1986. Jordan opines years later:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the financial knocks against the company in the financial community was that Ungermann-Bass did too many different things, too many different technologies. You heard it a lot in the financial arena. They say: “You guys are biting off too much. You’ve got too many different technologies and that going on here,” and the standard answer to that was: “Look, they’re all basic networking, very similar. They’re just a little bit different architectures, and protocols are all the same, blah, blah, blah,” which is bullshit. They really are different technologies and we were biting off too much. That was a valid criticism, especially looking back on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1986, the cash problems of INI required a solution. Too little revenue and too many expenses forced UB and GE to invest another $10 million into INI. UB’s share was $6.4 million: from then on UB would record 57% of future earnings and losses; losses UB could hardly bear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1986 proved to be an even more difficult year than 1985. While sales grew 54% to $110.9 million, an operating loss of nearly $2.0 million was reported. Net income totaled just $18 thousand.  Research and development costs remained high: 17.5% of revenue before accounting adjustments. Much of the sales growth was attributed to revenue of INI, albeit UB recorded only $4.7 million of sales to INI.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; (A market research organization had INI sales in 1986 as only $16 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Investment bankers informed the company they were unable to take Sytek public.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; Reasons cited were production problems with the product they were shipping to IBM, low gross margins, and the uncertainty about IBM’s token ring plans. Knowing they need more capital, Pliner approached Metcalfe and Krause at 3Com with the idea of a merger. It lasted but a few meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1985, IBM announced a new $50 million contingent commitment to buy Sytek’s broadband product sold as the PC LAN. Sluggish sales crept impatiently upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 15, 1985, IBM finally announced its IBM Token Ring Network. Before the announcement, Pliner and his team had been meeting with IBM representatives to discuss the contention brewing between IBM selling both (it’s – Sytek’s) PC LAN or its (IBM’s) token ring. Pliner remembers being told by the IBM representative:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;‘Yeah, you know, we’re going to have to go back to look at the numbers and I don’t have them here, but maybe you can get that from talking to…’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pliner remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we all came back and said:  ‘We better come up with a new strategic plan,’ and sure enough, when they made the announcement, two, three weeks after we had that meeting, they made the announcement, and the consultants – I can just remember, Gardner Group and all of them said:  ‘You’re crazy. This makes no sense at all. How can you take this expensive product and constrain it to a PC onto a workgroup LAN.’  So, nobody bought it, you know, and IBM couldn’t sell it very well, and that was the end. Then we scaled down and eventually stopped manufacturing altogether. Because of our terminal-to-host connectivity, and terminal-to-host was still, not a growing market but still a stable market, we were able to keep the company relatively, you know, moving, alive and somewhat profitable, but not great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sytek finished 1985 fifth in sales among LAN vendors.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; The loss of IBM sales, however, portended a bleak future for Sytek in 1986 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

For example Ralph Ungermann remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had looked at Interlan very, very closely. Alex must have started us into that, but we had many meetings in Boston. I already knew the company. We had already hired a couple of guys out of there, and I had already visited it a couple, three times, and we had talked about doing some things together. They were an OEM company. We’re an end-user company. I looked hard at it. We decided that we needed to focus, and so we chose not to get involved with an OEM company, but it would have filled out our product line some. So I was very well aware of what was going on, whom the bidders were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severino recalls the process and conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frankly a lot of companies came to the door to look around. Not to look around but just, raised their hands and said: ‘We’re interested in that kind of thing.’ But the one that looked the most acceptable to us and clearly the one that had the capitalization position that was going to allow us to get the price we wanted was Micom. Micom’s capitalization at the time was like $700 million. Micom also was facing the same kind of problems in data PBXs that we saw in dealing with DEC.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The management of Bridge Communications had drawn bead on Ungermann-Bass, defining their market as general purpose LANs, not PC LANs. To compete successfully meant staying technologically ahead of UB in terminal servers, adding broadband products, finding a way to offer PC products, offering both token ring and factory automation, i.e. MAP, products, and distinguishing their approach with better inter-network functionality. They had already leaped ahead of UB with their first-to-market terminal servers employing 16/32 bit microprocessors. Broadband products were under development. As for PC Ethernet controllers, they turned to their relationship with 3Com with which they already had a joint development contract. Judith Estrin recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I knew Bob Metcalfe, and we were located very close. Then we had a reference sell arrangement with them, and then we OEMed their product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development of a broadband product was relatively straightforward but manufacturing RF modems was not so easily mastered. Knowing they needed help, they acquired Coherent Systems in March, 1985, the same month they announced their broadband controllers. Bill Carrico recalls eliminating the UB advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All that kind of went away when we introduced broadband, and the main thing broadband’s good for, the main place we’ve always sold broadband, is where people just wanted the long distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1985, sales soared 128% to $30.5 million with net income of $4.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 1986, Bridge Communications went public, raising $ 22.3 million with a company valuation of $ 96 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1986 proved to be another successful year with sales increasing 51% to $46.2 million, albeit net income grew more slowly to $5.1 million. The costs of pursuing a general-purpose LAN strategy showed signs of catching up with Bridge just as it had with UB.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.19/Concord-Data-Systems/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the existence of INI, CDS management still felt they were in the driver’s seat to win the GM business. After all, they were the ones who helped GM pull off NCC. These views were held in spite of the fact that ever since NCC, GM had been dropping hints that: “we want our standard to be 10 megabits.” Soon GM began informing CDS of their requirements, not being educated by CDS, as had been past practice. Unfortunately, CDS had decided long ago to base their first products on 5 megabit per second RF modems, not the more difficult to develop 10 megabit per second modems. To now innovate a 10 megabit per second RF modem and then re-engineer their existing products would be difficult and costly, not to mention time consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDS had little choice but to continue selling the advantages of 5 megabit per second products. Miller remembers their logic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look you’re better off with six channels. You can make an argument you’re better off with six 5 megabit per second channels that fit into standard TV channels than you are with three 10 megabit per second channels not using standard TV cabling.” But GM was insistent. “It was a little tougher sell. They were beating us up that the next revision of MAP was going to specify 10 megabits. I probably didn’t do enough selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the spring approached, Miller spent less and less time calling on GM; partly because he didn’t enjoy the best of relationships with the GM buyer, and partly because he didn’t have the solution GM wanted. Nonetheless, CDS management remained optimistic. No one was willing to think the unspeakable. Miller recalls his attitude:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hey, no way they can go with INI. They’re not going to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spring of 1985 brought ruthless competition in the dial-up modem business spurred by new modem chips from Rockwell. The GM contract took on even more significance. Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oh, they had teams come and – oh, I mean, it was a whole big thing. Well, it was EDS.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; It got all complicated then because EDS was in the fray. So part of the problem was Ungermann-Bass and GE said they’d stand behind it. Yeah, we’ll solve your networking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the decision came. GM had selected INI over CDS. A stunned Miller recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t believe it. Couldn’t believe it! Just couldn’t believe it. It was terrible gloom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing the GM business was a severe blow; one too painful to accept fully. And then, as if winning was not enough, INI aggressively pressed their advantage. Again Miller:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And also INI had so much money. They were throwing money around like crazy. They were – Schoendorf was in all these articles. You know: ‘This is my LSI chip.’ They were putting salesmen in the field like it was going out of style. And we were losing money. I had been beat up. We didn’t have enough marketing. It’s not right. We hired a marketing guy and he turned out to be a disaster. There was – so there was some management problems unraveling at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDS did not become uncompetitive instantly. They would sign Honeywell as an OEM. What had happened, however, was CDS was no longer the perceived technology leader. Yet anyone reading the trade press before the GM decision easily could have concluded CDS was the market leader - as their Board members and sophisticated institutional investors had. Miller remembers the period following the loss of the GM account and the aggressiveness of INI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean the stakes got higher. The ratchet had gone up a couple of notches because now we have this well funded guy out there throwing money at the problem –  got two big companies, Ungermann-Bass was no small company and GE also behind them. All these bucks to spend. And hey, we’d spent net $10 million, at that time. But we still had a good reputation. We still – I mean, it wasn’t a total disaster. We’re not out of the market. So it was us and one other big player. And then we always – if anybody was sophisticated enough to measure performance, we always won. And INI was out making promises like crazy, while at that time you couldn’t see whether they could deliver or not. It was a mess. That’s when it was unraveling a bit. And at the same time, the modem business was less profitable. It was more competitive. At the time, we also had all our financial statements combined together, so it was hard to determine what the hell was going on. So I was under real pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the December 1985 issue of Data Communications, an article titled: MAP: A user revolt for standards, prominently mentioned CDS, albeit INI was clearly the market leader. In the article, CDS represents: “Board-level prototype implementations of the MAP chip set&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; will be available in March 1986, and general deliveries are slated to begin in the second or third quarter of 1986.” The same article reported: “So far, INI has spent $25 million in organizing and developing its MAP board products, and it expects to spend another $25 million expanding its sales and service force and continuing development of MAP-compatible products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite continuing optimistic forecasts for the MAP-token bus market, Andy McLane, Board member and the company’s original venture capitalist, was concerned. Could CDS compete successfully against a strongly motivated, well-funded competitor; especially given CDS’s weak financials? He argued the company needed to find a corporate partner, a partner with money, a strategic partner like the one UB had found. Miller remembers the negotiations with Gould, the parent of AMI, the semiconductor foundry developing CDS’s token bus chips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We decided we wanted a corporate partner. That was the thing to do. So Gould had been after us. We had some very strong discussions with Gould. In fact, we got an offer on the table for a minority investment. But the problem is, it was taking you over without taking you over. Betwixt and between is no good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDS had faced this choice years earlier with Analog Devices. Just as then, they declined. Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then we had heavy discussions with Allen Bradley. Rockwell had just taken over Allen Bradley at the time. I mean, Allen Bradley was an OEM and it made a lot of sense. And at the last minute, they said: ‘Well, we’ve decided, no we’re not going to pursue this anymore.’ They got spooked by the deteriorating modem business and the price we were asking. They ended up buying Interactive Systems from 3M for a song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board of Directors of CDS scrambled. Straining for ways to put a positive spin on a deteriorating situation, they considered splitting in two: a LAN company and a modem company. After all, wasn’t that what potential corporate partners had been saying? Again Miller recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Both Gould and Allen Bradley said: ‘We’re not interested in this modem business!’ You know, the financials were going to shit, so they got scared off. And so we talked with a bunch of others too. We knew that MAP was being talked about as this fantastic market, it’s going crazy, so we had a lot of people courting us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea quickly became a decision. Given the growth and excitement of the LAN business, it was concluded money would be easier to raise for their token bus company. So they formed Concord Communications Inc. with the mission to become the leader in token bus local area networking. Shortly thereafter, management finally had to acknowledge the simple fact that the project to develop VLSI token bus chips with AMI a disastrous failure. Not only did it leave CDS without the chips it had been counting on for success, it had cost the company $12 million with nothing to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we waited – and actually it bled the modem side. It was awful. So we couldn’t hire people and, oh it was awful. And there was also a big rivalry in the company. Big jealousy in the modem people: ‘Oh, those fucking guys have been a bunch of prima donnas.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board also decided to go after new management. “And we also made the decision, hey, I’d be best – I was pretty burnt out probably by then. My strength wasn’t operations anyway. We got a guy who was a friend of TA’s to come in and be here two to three days a week. We went out to raise money for the LAN side alone. And we got $7 million in June 1986.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LAN market, especially the MAP segment, had not lost its luster. Concord Communications raised $7 million with a company valuation of $22 million in June 1986.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Kanwal Rekhi, Vice-President of Engineering remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the end of ‘84, there was real trouble because we were spending much faster than we were bringing the revenue in, and as it happens in any start-up, there is a day of reckoning, giving too much for the resources you have and, as a result, you’re not satisfying anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1985 the Board felt the need to make changes. Rekhi remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the company went through a re-organization. I was the VP of Engineering, and Dr. Inger Singh, CEO, was fired by the board because we weren’t making our business plans. So, once he was fired, I was made interim president. I was very worried that we weren’t doing the right things and, so right after I became interim president, we’re doing nothing but TCP/IP and Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excelan retrenched, focusing on the engineering workstation wisdom, not the office market, and on only Ethernet and TCP/IP. They labeled their focus as high-speed computer-to-computer connections.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial results for 1985 reflected the benefits. Sales increased 90% to $9.9 million with net income of $100 thousand. In a presentation prepared for investment bankers dated December 1985, management highlighted their sales growth, introduction of personal computer controller, more DEC-compatible products and the addition of three more sales offices. In the same presentation, they outlined their future products for the second half of 1986 as including MAP protocols, token ring, token bus, and a terminal server. The lure of building a bigger company was hard to forgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rekhi turned to consultants for instant help, one being Dan Lynch, a TCP/IP expert from his Arpanet experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 1986, the search for a president ended with the hiring of C. Richard Moore. Moore had been president of an engineering workstation company and previously had held a number of positions within Hewlett-Packard. Sales of 1986 increased 120% to $22 million with net income of $2.4 million. Excelan had averted disaster.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

By virtue of having built an emulator for the LANCE Ethernet controller chip designed by DEC, and being fabricated by Advanced Micro Devices and Mostek, CMC created a line of Ethernet controllers around the LANCE chip. In June 1984, they raised $4 million of venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a series of missed sales and engineering projections, caused in measure by delayed shipments of LANCE ships, prompted investors to make management changes. In 1985, a new president was recruited to replace Green who resigned. Sales grew slightly in 1985, to $1.8 million, putting more strains on cash and forcing a firm-saving financing of $600 thousand in December 1985. Sales grew to $3.5 million in 1986, but a loss of $200 thousand still resulted. A combination of Excelan signing up key OEMs and the LANCE chip being late to market left CMC struggling for a way to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.22/Codex/",

In 1985, the lure of heading a high-profile start-up was too tempting and Murray Bolt left Codex for the fourth generation CBX firm, Ztel Corporation. James Storey, president of Codex, turned to John Pugh to replace Bolt. Pugh remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all Murray’s fault, a lot of it was the company couldn’t afford to put the money into it. I came in and the first thing I did was get rid of the head of marketing, because he had no background in local area networking. I brought in another guy that had a limited background. And I essentially had to get rid of him, too, because he just didn’t bring enough expertise. We were foundering from a marketing standpoint. I think we had good engineers. But we couldn’t define the programs well enough so that they would stick. And at the same time, I was suffering from funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Codex realized they could not sell the product they were OEMing from Ungermann-Bass, especially when competing for the same customer. Again Pugh recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a great deal of investment on our part to get Ungermann-Bass started. The problem was we kept competing. They were in the process of developing their product line and broadening their product line and for us to bring in ….. we just couldn’t keep up with them. We could not evaluate their product and sell it on a timely basis.  Their salesman was always out ahead of us saying, “You need that, fine, we’ll give you that. We started doing our own product line that was going to use some of the Ungermann-Bass software that we paid them a license for. And we brought our own line in, and we started focusing on that. And the idea was eventually to move Ungermann-Bass out and have our own product line. About the middle of that, Storey left and Motorola moved John Locket up as president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of revenue, when combined with high expenses and many other profitable, and more strategic, products to invest in, led to more changes. Pugh remembers, “So the focus in terms of the LAN business started going down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1987, Codex had attempted and failed to enter the LAN business.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/12.23/Micom-Interlan/",

Bill Norred, President, recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The convincing factor that caused me to decide that we should do Interlan was the fact that we felt that the window of opportunity may be very narrow - whether we could develop our own products in sufficient time to be a factor in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 1, 1985, Micom acquired Interlan for 1.7 million shares of stock, valued at $65 million the day of the transaction, and merged Interlan into a newly formed subsidiary named MICOM-Interlan, Inc. Micom management began integrating Interlan’s operations into those its own. Paul Severino, formerly President of Interlan, became Corporate Vice President, Product Planning and Technology, Micom, and Chairman of the Board MICOM-Interlan, Inc. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We did the deal. I can tell you that every investor at Interlan made a lot of money. Most of the founders did pretty well, at that price, and the problems came literally the day after the merger when, you know, just everything changed. The Interlan distributors and reps were cut loose. Roger wanted an operating guy in who basically was going to glue the PBX and LAN business, and it turns out he was the wrong guy. He turned a lot of people off. Most of the officers of Interlan got turned off one by one and left. Interlan business just flattened out because we had no salesmen. Nobody was selling the products. And product development almost came to a screeching halt for a while, because this new guy came in and decided to reorganize and do everything differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Evans remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the time we acquired Interlan we were adding more direct people to take care of the data PBX customers that insisted on dealing direct, but because we still had the rep arrangement in place, we were still paying the commissions, so the selling expense was starting to get out of hand. We made the commitment that, as part of the Interlan acquisition, we would transition to a direct sales organization, and we would restructure our relationship with our reps and essentially phase them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micom’s Annual Report for Fiscal Year March 1985 reported the mix of Interlan’s LAN sales and their own local area networking, mostly data PBX, sales as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-12231-micom-networking-sales-1983-1985-in-millions&quot;&gt;Exhibit 12.23.1 Micom Networking Sales 1983-1985 (In millions)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiscal Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1983&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1985&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Micom LAN&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;20.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40.1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;54.3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Interlan LAN&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Total Networking&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;23.1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;46.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;82.3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Report also indicated that although Interlan had Net Income of $1.2 million for the twelve months ending March 1985, for the three months of January-March 1985, they lost $1.8 million. Interlan dearly needed the cash infusion of Micom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1985, Severino frustrated in his new role of planning role combined with his minimal influence in the affairs of MICOM-Interlan resigned.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I knew that Micom had to make some leaps in order to really compete again, and I wanted to take off a group and just go build the next generation of product, and Roger and I just couldn’t come to an agreement that that was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1986, MICOM-Interlan finally announced the TCP/IP products that had been too expensive too develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the twelve months ending March 1986, data PBX sales dropped 25%.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; Total LAN sales would equal $58.4 million, 30.8% of sales. Firm sales dropped 2% from 1985 and Net Income dropped 58%. The changes being wrought by the personal computer were having their toil. Norred recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the issues that we did not do an adequate job of dealing with is recognizing that the microcomputer was a revolution, not an evolution, and we didn’t deal with it in a revolutionary kind of way. There are very few things in the history of data communications that don’t evolve relatively slowly, but the impact that the PC had on the computing/data communications industry as a whole I think far exceeded anybody’s expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 9, 1986, Norred turned over the reigns of Micom to Evans who became President and Chief Executive Officer. Norred’s role became limited to Chairman of the Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICOM-Interlan sales grew only slightly in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Only the most optimistic of forecasters, or, as it would turn out, the prescient, believed Networking sales would reach $1 billion in 1986. Or that the crowded field of over 200 firms would collapse to an oligopoly of 11 LAN firms controlling 68% of the market by 1985 and, in 1986, the data PBX market would collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving these changes was the phenomenal growth in the number of computer networks. By the end of 1986, there were an estimated 100,000 computer networks. Most of these nascent networks were cobbled together from department or computer-computer centered networks, not some grand organizational design. When the value of having users on these different networks share information or communicate with each other became important for businesses, they discovered that it was not as easy as they might have believed. So as long as their fledgling networks were from the same vendor, and the vendor supported both personal computer and terminal server networks, they had a chance. Yet that was not enough. Corporate buyers had no desire to once again live under the tyranny of a vendor as they had with IBM. The interconnecting of these islands of networks into enterprise networks is the story of the next two chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even as the growth in the creation of computer networks drove sales upward at 80% per annum, one sector flagged in comparison. MAP, or factory automation, sales totaled a disheartening $30 million in 1986, a far cry from the billion-dollar market assumed in 1982-1983. Those firms that had made big bets on MAP, such as Ungermann-Bass and Concord Data Systems, suffered the effects. On the other hand, 3Com that had focused on the robust personal computer market prospered, even including a strategic diversion. Not that betting on personal computers was a certain recipe for success, witness Sytek. The firms dominating Data Communications, Codex and Micom, struggled to understand the importance of LANs and the impact of the personal computer, and had to either OEM product from a LAN vendor or acquire such a firm. Other firms, such as Interlan, and soon to be many more, discovered that too little, too late, did not make for success and willingly sold themselves to larger, more endowed firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of the growth in computer networks was not the only compelling dynamic in corporate communications during 1983-1986. Corporations were also beginning to privatize their data and voice networks. After the break-up of AT&amp;amp;T on January 1, 1984, AT&amp;amp;T and the RBOCs began pricing digital T-1 circuits to corporations so attractively management began building their own “telephone” networks. The existing Data Communication firms, and a new breed of start-ups, jumped on the opportunity to sell T-1 multiplexers. The story of the rise of corporate networks is the following chapter.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.0/Overview/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1982, AT&amp;amp;T, again facing the unstoppable advance of digital technologies and the press of market competition, filed for, and received, tariffs to lease high-speed digital circuits. To be become known simply as T-1, corporate customers could replace twenty-four of the highest speed analog circuits then available with one 1.544 million bits per second digital circuit. The cost savings were irresistible. In 1983, the sales of the multiplexers needed to interconnect slower speed data circuits to a T-1 circuit totaled an astonishing $30 million. In 1984, sales of T-1 multiplexers doubled to $60 million. What began as an opportunity to save costs quickly became a strategic rationale for corporations to begin building their own wide area communication networks, or WANs, in a phenomenon known as “Be Your Own Bell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Data Communication firms to introduce T-1 multiplexers did so not out of grand strategic visions but because customers wanted inexpensive products to consolidate their data lines and save costs. Only later did these first firms offer the add-on cards needed to support digitized voice channels, again being pulled into the larger market of voice communications rather than attacking it as a ripe opportunity waiting to be picked. As more Data Communication firms entered the market, their products reflected incremental innovations, not the radically new multiplexers required by corporations to manage their increasingly complex data and voice WANs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others read the future correctly. In 1981-1982, Tymnet, a value-added network provider, initiated a project with Satellite Business Systems to provide a cross-country high-speed digital service completely by-passing AT&amp;amp;T. A number of the people involved with the project quickly recognized the need for a sophisticated T-1 multiplexer that did not then exist. They proposed that Tymnet build and sell such a product, but management did not envision themselves as sellers of equipment and turned the business proposal down. Convinced of the correctness of their insight, four people soon resigned from Tymnet to become entrepreneurs. Within a year, former Tymnet employees will start three new T-1 multiplexer companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one leading Data Communication firm, Timeplex, resisted entering the fast growing T-1 multiplexer market through an acquisition or OEM arrangement. Codex attempted to develop a project internally but by 1984 had resigned themselves to failure. They then signed an OEM agreement to sell a first generation product from a start-up. Two years later, Codex switched to a more sophisticated product OEMed from a different start-up. Micom management, distracted by the complications of the dataPBX business, belatedly acquired a T-1 company. By 1988, sales of T-1 multiplexers totaled nearly $400 million, far exceeding those of statistical multiplexers. Yet only two of the high profile T-1 multiplexer start-ups avoided failure or acquisition. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.1/AT&T-and-the-T-1-Tariffs-1982-1984/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1982, AT&amp;amp;T filed for, and received, tariffs to lease digital data transport services under the High Capacity Terrestrial Digital Facility or Tariff No. 270. AT&amp;amp;T had finally decided to make available to its corporate customers a technology that it had been using internally since 1962 and had been making available to the Defense Department since 1957. &lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; To much of the world this decision came as a surprise. But for those in the know, it was inevitable, both because of the overwhelming economics of digital transmission as well as the pressures of market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic digital transmission carrier or circuit, known as T-1 (or T1), transmits 1.544 megabits per second (Mbit/s). Channel banks, also called channel service units, interleaved twenty-four 64 thousand bit per second (Kbit/s) sub-channels into the T-1 circuit. The 64 Kbit/s sub-channel, or DS-0 channel, was the then standard voice grade channel; also equivalent to the 56-Kbit/s data circuit with its additional 8-Kbit/s of overhead signaling per channel.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;   (See Exhibit 11.0 T-1 Circuit with Channel Banks.) In time, improvements in voice compression would reduce the number of bits required to transmit voice to 8 Kbit/s, thus making it possible to transmit 192 traditional analog voice circuits over one T-1 circuit.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; The effect was to dramatically increase the bandwidth of the existing telephone network – after the investment transforming the analog circuits to digital – and to dramatically reduce the costs of telecommunications. In January 1984, immediately post-divestiture, AT&amp;amp;T began actively marketing T-1 services under the product name Accunet T1.5.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-110-t-1-circuit-with-channel-banks&quot;&gt;Exhibit 11.0 T-1 Circuit with Channel Banks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/clip_image002_0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of T-1 circuit with channel banks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982, when AT&amp;amp;T received Tariff No. 270, digital transmission was a proven technology and available from a growing number of competitors. First there were the Other Common Carriers (OCCs), such as MCI and Sprint, who were aggressively marketing the advantages of T-1 to corporate customers in hopes of taking market share from AT&amp;amp;T. Since they were still building out their networks, they could employ digital technologies immediately, giving them the attacker’s advantage. Second, microwave technologies were making it easy to build communication networks without burying wire, cable, or optical fiber in the ground. There were over forty new Digital Transport Service (DTS) microwave licenses submitted to the FCC by firms wanting to qualify as new common carriers. Third, cable companies, particularly the metropolitan cable operators, were claiming they could provide digital data and voice communication by-pass services; by-pass as in eliminating much of the intra-LATA telephone services from the local Bell Operating Companies. (Intra-LATA services are effectively telephone calls made within one area code – within one central office (CO) switch - and are considered local calls. Inter-LATA calls are long distance calls.) Fourth, corporate customers were learning that other new technologies were making it possible to extend communication networks to reduce costs and increase functionality, such as the claims of the vendors of broadband LANs that their communication networks could carry data, voice and video, encompassing entire campus facilities and by-passing the telephone network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obtain the advantages of T-1, corporations required equipment to multiplex their various slow speed data circuits into the T-1 circuits - for AT&amp;amp;T customers that meant into the DS-O sub-channels of the channel banks that connected to the T-1 circuits. That piece of equipment, a T-1 multiplexer, created both wonderful new economic opportunities for the existing multiplexer companies and, in time, dire consequences for those companies that did not act, or respond appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;T-1 multiplexers interconnect by multiplexing and de-multiplexing many slow speed data and/or digitized voice circuits through a T-1 circuit. The first generation T-1 multiplexers were designed for data circuits, but interconnected digitized voice circuits. Known as point-to-point T-1 multiplexers, they differed radically from the existing paradigm of statistical multiplexers because they could accommodate larger number of input circuits and the digital output circuits fed into channel banks not modems. First generation T-1 multiplexers gave users very little management control. But second generation “networking” T-1 multiplexers gave users first manual, and increasingly automatic, rerouting of circuits; adaptive bandwidth management; flexible configuration of network topologies; reliable system reliable architectures and much more. The history of which firms correctly anticipated how quickly the sophistication of T-1 multiplexers would evolve determined the outcome of market competition and thus those firms that grew and those that did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size and growth rate of the T-1 multiplexer market was directly related to the number of T-1 circuits. Each end of a T-1 circuit, or termination, represented the need for a T-1 multiplexer. The first installations of T-1 circuits were local circuits connecting a corporation’s circuits through a central office (CO) or bypassing the CO and directly interconnecting a corporation’s locations or facilities. Up until around 1985, the demand for T-1 circuits exceeded the ability of the RBOCs to install them and that, in turn, drove the demand for private by-pass networks. (See Exhibit 13.1 T-1 Installed base 1984-1988) By 1988, the importance of private by-pass networks declined as either AT&amp;amp;T/IXCs (Interexchange carriers) or the RBOCs were able to supply the needed T-1 circuits. As the Exhibit shows, the growth in terminations, while somewhat erratic, grew dramatically between 1984 and 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1331-t-1-installed-base-1984-1988-thousands&quot;&gt;Exhibit 13.3.1 T-1 Installed Base 1984-1988 (Thousands)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-1 Terminating Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1985&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1986&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1987&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1988&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Long Haul Via AT&amp;amp;T / IXCs&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1.4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Local RBOC Intra LATA&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Private By-Pass Networks&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;All T-1 Lines&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7.5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11.4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;All T-1 Terminations&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;22.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;46&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;62&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Annual Growth T-1 Terminations&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7.8&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Annual Growth Rate T-1 Terminations&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;56%&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;52%&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;","next" : "/section/13.3/The-Beginnings-of-Be-Your-Own-Bell/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The revolution from analog to digital transmission led corporations to install their own private communication networks, or wide area networks, in a phenomenon then known as “Be Your Own Bell.” From the perspective of 1988, Audrey MacLean, once Western Region Vice-President of Tymnet, a leading supplier of value-added networks, remembers the reasons for the emergence of wide-area networks and the motivation to Be your own Bell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, in the wake of the break-up of the Bell Systems and the confusion that that caused, major corporations decided: communications is no longer simply an operating expense, it’s so integral to the communication flow and the information flow in your company that if behooves you, strategically, to take control of that resource. So, for the first time, companies decided:  “Hey, this network is critical to our business operation,” and they hadn’t thought about it like that before. This happens to correspond with the move towards the introduction of a senior information officer in many of the larger corporations, again recognizing the importance of the technology to their future competitiveness. The other factor that motivated them was the sheer disruption caused by the break-up of the Bell System. They realized they could no longer leave the driving to Ma Bell, and they really had to assume responsibility for this themselves. There was a lot of debate over whether or not you should ‘Be your own Bell,’ and a lot of the more astute end users began saying: “You can talk about whether you’re going to Be your own Bell, or not, but in reality, all of us are. It’s just some of us are going to do it better than others, so you might as well start now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bottom line was that, through a relatively small increase in capital expenditures, usually to the tune of maybe one to two percent of one year’s communications budget, you could reduce your on-going facilities charges in the network by as much as six or more percent, which typically came right off your bottom line. In anybody’s communications budget, you usually find about 70% of the costs are facilities charges, so when you could have that kind of bottom line impact, the economic incentives alone were compelling, but you add to that the strategic motivations, and there was a very strong movement towards the adoption of private networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MacLean captures, the early 1980’s represented a significant turning point in the use of computers and communications by corporations. The explosion in the use of computers following the introduction of personal computers, especially the IBM PC in 1981, combined with the attendant rise in use of local area network, LANs, drove the need for data transmission over the traditional voice telephone network. At first these needs were met by creating data communication networks, using modems and statistical multiplexers, or packet-switched value-added networks. But these networks were slow and invariably designed to fit the needs of specific application(s). When high-speed digital transmission became available, the cost savings made possible by consolidating numerous data networks over one “utility” network were compelling. Corporations, by investing in capital equipment, T-1 multiplexers, and leasing digital T-1 circuits, could in effect replace all the switching and transmission they had always acquired from AT&amp;amp;T, but without also absorbing all the overhead and settlement costs imbedded in AT&amp;amp;T pricing. It was not uncommon for corporations to recover all their investment in capital equipment in less than a year from the savings obtained eliminating analog lease line costs. When corporations also consolidated their voice circuits over these early digital networks, they created their own wide area networks (WANs). As the Chief Information Officers (CIOs), or their equivalents, began demanding more sophisticated management tools and product capabilities, the traditional suppliers of data communication products struggled to respond. Entrepreneurs did not. But corporations quickly wanted more than smart products. They wanted to buy systems and have one-stop shopping with single vendor accountability, service and support. Corporate buyers drove quickly drove industry consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.4/Data-Communications-Industry-Overview/",

New market opportunities reflected investment conflicts to the never-ending need to improve existing products to gain or protect market share. One opportunity already observed was the need corporations had to interconnect terminals and multiple computers. Those Data Communication firms electing to enter the Networking market did so by incrementally innovating their statistical multiplexer technologies and introducing dataPBXs. DataPBXs appeared competitive until the personal computer radically changed the needed communication speeds and dataPBXs withered into obscurity. The impact of the personal computer equally impacted the modem business. Again new entrants, not existing firms, recognized the opportunity and established early market leadership. Digital T-1 transmission and T-1 multiplexers would prove even more threatening to the success and survival of Data Communication firms.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.5/General-DataComm/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1969, General DataComm Industries, Inc. (GDC) had a history of responding to customer needs, rather than anticipating them. Such was the case with T-1 multiplexers, a product they first introduced in 1977, years ahead of any competitor. Robert Smith, Vice-President recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s this little oil company down in Texas called Texaco. They had a couple of data centers in Houston that were about eight miles apart, and some cross town lines running 230.4 kilobits per second, which was a standard channel offering of AT&amp;amp;T’s at the time, and they were breaking down the data centers into low speed channels, and we had sold them a couple of 1251s multiplexers. One of the guys at Texaco, found that under the DDS [Digital Data Service] tariff, they had a thing called a DAL-3, which was 1.544 megabits, only available in the local metropolitan area. They found out that they could get a DAL-3 T1 pipe between their two data centers at some phenomenal saving over what they were paying for multiple 230.4s.  And they said to us:  “Look, we can buy lots of your 1251s to give us the low speed channels, but we’ll only do it if you give us something that will allows us to put it into a T1 pipe.” So we had a twelve channel multiplexer, and we kind of reengineered the back plane and the high-speed common card and cranked it up, and we came up with a 6 channel multiplexer that would run at 1.5 megabits per second. We plugged that in front of our 1251s and ran them at 256 into the channels and Texaco went with their T1 and that, as far as I know, was the first commercial T1 data application ever in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 1981, GDC introduced their Megamux T-1 multiplexer, a design evolved from their early “kludge-like” products. The Megamux was a simple point-to-point multiplexer that relied on hardware switching that made frequent and dynamic reconfigurations of the input-output data lines difficult.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; The Megamux also had minimal network management capabilities. In brief, it was a product that consolidated a number of expensive high-speed circuits into one T-1 circuit and thus saved customers money. But it lacked the software features that would be needed by customers to build networks, the just emerging need of corporations. When first introduced, the Megamux supported only data, not digitized voice, input lines, a deficiency corrected a year later. Smith recalls the progression:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we thought, well maybe we could sell a few more of these, so we built 20. Well, low and behold they sold, and we said: “Gee, we ought to crank up our build plan to about 80 units.” And we did, and they went out pretty quick too. So we said: “Hey, maybe there’s a market here,” so we went out looking at this thing seriously, and we developed our Megamux and that was what hit the market in 1981. We found that there were people who had a lot of data channels, but couldn’t quite justify a T1 line. If we could afford to put their voice tie lines in the same T-pipe, they could afford the T-pipe. So we came out with the CVSD voice channel card in 1982.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1981 and 1982, however, were traumatic years for GDC. Accustomed to greater than twenty percent per year sales growth, management struggled to understand sales growth of only 8% in 1981. The problems persisted into 1982 when sales growth remained a stagnant 6%. GDC would loose $1.2 million on revenue of over $60 million – the first of the major multiplexer companies to lose money. The principal reason: sales of equipment to telephone companies, especially to General Telephone &amp;amp; Telegraph, a key customer, plummeted. GDC management had little choice but to cut expenses. They slashed engineering costs by 10%, rather than increasingly them by the normal 10% or more. New projects were delayed or abandoned as monies were diverted to projects promising immediate sales. One product essentially abandoned was the Megamux. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were OEMing [a statistical multiplexer from] Micom for several years, and we decided we should do our own. When we got done with Megamux, we threw engineering resources to that, and didn’t focus on the T1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, the market for T-1 multiplexers soared to an unexpected $30M. GDC’s Megamux, still one of the few T-1 multiplexers available, contributed to a resurgence of sales. With sales growth of 43% in 1983, GDC returned to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, only two firms posed viable competition: Avanti and Datatel. Essentially start-ups, they, like GDC, had innovated point-to-point T-1 multiplexers in response to customer demand, or having related technologies that were easily reconfigured into a T-1 multiplexer. Unlike GDC, they did not have established customer bases or distribution systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of GDC’s Megamux continued into 1984, garnering a 35% market share in a market that doubled to $60 million. GDC also captured a 10% market share in statistical multiplexers. However not investing in the Megamux left them with a vulnerable product, a vulnerability about to be exploited by their long-standing nemesis: Timeplex.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In December 1983. Timeplex entered the T-1 multiplexer market with the announcement of its Link/1. Making three-node networks possible, not just point-to-point connections, the Link/1 represented a first step towards a networking T-1 multiplexer. In addition, each Link/1 could support five T-1 circuits compared to just one per each Megamux, a significant competitive advantage. Smith of GDC remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Timeplex could build a triangle network: three point network, interconnect with three muxes, and we had to take six because we had two per link to do it. So they got the real jump based on the networking marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like GDC, Timeplex sold a full line of data communication products, albeit OEMing its modems from Universal Data Systems (dial-up modems) and Paradyne (lease-line modems). Technology never was considered Timeplex’s strength: Rather it was known for its aggressive marketing and sales organization. The Link/1, for example, did not even offer networking reconfiguration capabilities equal to those of the GDC Megamux.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  Nevertheless, in 1984, Timeplex seized a whopping 18% market share for T-1 multiplexers on the strength of its distribution network and strong ties with the RBOCs. (See Exhibit 11.4 Statistical and T-1 Multiplexer Sales 1984.) Timeplex, like the other early Data Communication companies, conceived T-1 multiplexers as products to save customers money by consolidating their data circuits and, only later, would they add voice support to their systems. Ed Botwinick, president of Timeplex, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the early ’80s, we started developing the Link family because we saw it was going to be a networking market. Everybody said T-1s are very expensive, so nobody’s going to have very many of them. I said:  “I don’t care how expensive they are, if you fill them up, they may represent a major saving in terms of getting rid of lower speed lines. Communications needs are going up and we’re going to put voice on these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1985, Timeplex displaced GDC as the leading T-1 multiplexer vendor, capturing nearly one-third of the $158 million market with sales of $48 million. In doing so, the Link/1 comprised an astonishing 40% of Timeplex’s sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1361-statistical-and-t-1-multiplexer-sales---1984--millions&quot;&gt;Exhibit 13.6.1 Statistical and T-1 Multiplexer Sales - 1984 ($ Millions)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Multiplexer Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percent Market Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-1 Multiplexer Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percent Market Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Multiplexer Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Timeplex&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;16.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;17.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;51.3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Codex&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;20.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;GDC&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10.5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;37.9&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Micom&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;19.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Infotron&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;16.7&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Others&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;44.2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;239&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;63.3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;302.3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Clearly, Codex had lost its entrepreneurial drive and, thus, would increasingly depend on other firms for innovation through OEM or distribution agreements. The inability of Codex management to manage innovation development would acknowledged years later by John Pugh, vice president of marketing. Both he and James Storey, Codex’s President, believed in the importance T-1 multiplexers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We reorganized in 1982, and they took marketing and broke it up and we formed product lines. T1 was in the multiplexer product line. We knew they were falling behind, and Jim Story was extremely frustrated, because he could not get the programs moving.  I made a major presentation to Motorola, and talked about the tariff structures, why you had to be in this business, what the threat was to Codex in the analog business, and that we had to move. And Story, president of the company, bought it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, management had no choice but to conclude that their internal development efforts were a failure and began negotiations to OEM a T-1 multiplexer from Avanti. In 1984 Codex introduced its 6240 T-1 multiplexer, a repackaged Avanti point-to-point multiplexer.

On February 1, 1981, they hired Bertil Nordin who would, with an infusion of $3.5 million of venture capital, quickly transform the sleepy little company in Norcross GA into a market presence.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  Nordin remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you take any industry that starts out as a cottage industry, you always have a lot of competitors. As the industry grew, it took more and more marketing, more and more R&amp;amp;D in order to remain competitive, and the upshot was that it’s like a pyramid.  It starts out with a lot of competitors – actually, more like an hourglass.  It starts out with somebody with the original product, and then a lot of companies – small companies – are in it, and then it narrows down again to be very few of them, and only the strongest survive. So, our feeling was at the time that if you’re going to be one of the longer term players, you better put together a pretty broad spectrum of data communications products and become pretty large or you’re not going to be one of the survivors. So that’s essentially what we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1983, buoyed by the prospects of their new statistical multiplexer, DCA went public and raised $24 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc9&quot; href=&quot;#fn9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;   A few months later they acquired Technical Analysis Corporation that had a hot product named IRMA that enabled IBM personal computers to connect to IBM mainframe computers. DCA management then set their eyes on the modem manufacturer Rixon, a subsidiary of the French conglomerate, Schlumberger Ltd. They soon reached a deal that for $27 million would transform DCA into a leading Data Communication firm with realistic prospects of reaching $100 million of revenue in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only CASE, the British data communication firm that had played such an important a role in the early years of Micom, had a distribution deal with Rixon. Rixon resold the CASE multiplexers and CASE was not about to lose its key reseller. After complicated negotiations, DCA backed out of the deal, saving $27 million, but not gaining the sales force and product line it so dearly desired.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;   A sales force it needed to sell the T-1 multiplexer it had negotiated the rights to manufacture and sell from Scitec, an Australian company.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In early 1982, Sarah Schlinger, director of business planning of Tymnet, decided she had learned enough. It was time to prepare a business plan and present it to her superiors. If her responsibility was to articulate how Tymnet might more aggressively pursue the coming opportunities in wideband communication services, she had potentially found a jewel. Her only hesitation: the opportunity was to build a product for resale, not a service to sell more time on Tymnet’s packet-switching network or private networks to corporate customers. But the fact that the idea had emerged from an on-going project Tymnet had with Satellite Business Systems (SBS) gave her confidence the idea to build a T-1 multiplexer would not be dismissed out-of-hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tymnet had been created around 1979 to administrate and develop the packet-switching network Tymshare had spent a decade building to serve their time-sharing customers. Tymshare recognized corporate customers needed to interconnect their growing base of disparate computers and peripherals - a need independent of the need for time-sharing services – and through Tymnet they could provide such networks either as a service or by creating private networks to then sell. The project that had led to the idea of building a T-1 multiplexer came from an experiment Tymnet was conducting with SBS that would interconnect a customer’s computers/peripherals in New York City and San Francisco using Manhattan Cable in New York City, SBS’s long-haul satellite connection and microwave radio services in the Bay Area. Audrey MacLean, Western Regional Manger of Tymnet, and instrumental in selling a $6 million private network to the Bank of America, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had responsibility for helping to come up with some willing guinea pigs, customers, for that experiment; among them folks like Crocker Bank, etc. However, my interest in the area was keen, because at the time, the western region was really leading Tymnet into a business area that for them was private packet-switched sales. It was probably in ‘81 that Tymnet first started building private packet-switched networks, beginning with TRW down in southern California, and then, in the 1982 time frame, the Bank of America network. I looked at what the Bank of America’s overall communications need was, and saw that the X-25 network that I had sold them really only covered only a small cross-section of their application needs, and that if I looked at their whole global data network plan, and if I also concurrently looked at their voice network that they were rolling out at the time – I think they bought $15 million of PBXs at about the same time they bought the $6 million worth of packet switches – it began to occur to me that it would make logical sense for them to, in some fashion, at least in terms of the transmission, integrate these two networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The experiment was looking at exactly that, provisioning T-1 rate service out to the end-user’s location, T-1 being a 1.544 megabit transmission connection to that location, which by far exceeded any of the then current demands for data connectivity, fifty-six kilobit was considered really fast, but was entirely appropriate if you were going to look at including voice switching needs, or voice traffic needs, on those links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge was how to interconnect and switch the multiple T-1 satellite circuits and the multiple data and voice circuits (or DS-0 circuits) at customer’s locations. MacLean remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There were multiplexers, such as the type made by General DataComm, that could take N inputs and one T1 output. There were channel banks that could take 24 or 48 voice inputs and one T1 output, but they were all the traditional multiplexer triangles, if you will, in terms of their architecture. They were not switches. So in order to put together a switching core in these main hub locations in the network, you literally had to back-to-back cross wire multiplexers to begin to have switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Chrisman, who had joined Tymnet to head up the engineering for the SBS project and reported to Art Caisse, had the responsibility to create the product to interconnect and switch the T-1 or DS-1 circuits. MacLean remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roger used to walk around disgruntled, bitching about the fact that this was one step up from carrier pigeon. So, it was as his thinking began to grow about the kind of switch that he needed to solve the problem that he came up with the thinking of building a switch that handled multiple DS-1s and was able to move traffic from one DS-1 onto another within the same switching mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the product idea Schlinger had studied and reduced to a business proposal and submitted to her Tymnet superiors. They in turn took it to the management of Tymshare. Again MacLean remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A proposal was taken forward to the board of Tymshare, the parent company, to build the kind of switching product that Roger was lamenting didn’t exist for his experiment, and the board of Tymshare turned it down, primarily because they didn’t envision themselves as a hardware company. They saw themselves more as a user of other people’s hardware, and provider of X-25 software technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacLean, Chrisman, Caisse and Schlinger were both disappointed and partly relieved. If Tymnet did not want to act, then their consciences were clean if they did.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.12/Network-Equipment-Technologies/",

They knew no product existed to interconnect and switch the growing number of alternatives in wideband transmission services with customers’ lower speed data and even voice lines. They also did not believe the opportunity would go unnoticed for long. So they began meeting to plot their product and firm strategy. But after a month of intense conversations and debate, they found they could neither agree on a product specification nor who should play what management roles. In August, MacLean and Chrisman parted company with Caisse. MacLean recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Art Caisse was contemplating building DTS microwave systems and Roger and I were dead set against that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Chrisman’s wife, Sarah Schlinger, joined them. MacLean, more certain than ever of her views, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you took those same networking concepts that we had employed in the X-25 packet switch arena, and brought them over to a physical layer only T1 network, and offered that same level of management control and reliability to the end user, that, combined with the economic and strategic motivations, would be a sure fire way to successfully win over a large number of the potential private network customers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They knew they needed others with complementary skills and knowledge, specifically a software expert with network management experience. There was equally no doubt who they wanted to join them: Robbie Forkish. Forkish had once worked with them at Tymnet and was now with Bell Northern Research, or BNR. So they called him up and invited him to lunch without signaling their true purpose. Surprised, Forkish told them he was happy were he was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I went to BNR in ‘82. They were working on their next generation technology in their office automation area. I was interested in voice, number one, because even then, there were people who would look at our private network solution [Tymnet] and say:  “But I’m spending 80% of my dollars on voice. What are you going to do for me there?” At the same time, I felt that, perhaps not so correctly, as it turns out, that the PBX was going to play a role competitive to the LANs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forkish also sensed the opportunity that was discussed and, after a group Thanksgiving dinner, he made the big commitment, although he would not formally begin until February of 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After polishing their business plan, MacLean began calling on venture capitalists to raise the money needed to launch their company. She was making some progress but not with the first tier funds that she so desperately wanted. At the same time, the small team knew they needed to fill two noticeable holes in the founding team: a head of engineering and a president. Chrisman remember someone who had impressed him while working on the Caravan project at Tymnet: Walt Gill, the chief engineer of the Telecommunications Equipment Division, Avantek, Inc. Chrisman contacted Gill who independently had recognized the need for some kind of switching product. Gill was intrigued with the ideas Chrisman shared, but was unwilling to commit until he knew who was going to be president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture capitalists asked MacLean the same question during her investment presentations. As difficult as that conversation can often be, a conversation frequently ending friendships or even a budding firm’s launch, MacLean recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We all sat around a coffee table and said:  “We’re not ever going to go to second tier venture firms.”  We could have had the deal funded, quite frankly. I knew that I was going to be selling to Blue Chip companies, and I couldn’t do it without first tier venture funding and the right kind of management structure for the company.  None of us had ever seen ourselves as the president of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the partners of one of the first tier funds was sufficiently interested that when the curriculum vitae of an executive looking for a start-up arrived unexpectedly in the mail, with a cover letter describing the opportunities he saw in telecommunications, opportunities sounding very similar to those in the business plan of MacLean and team, James Anderson, general partner with Merrill, Pickard, Anderson and Eyre, quickly put MacLean in touch with Bruce Smith. She recalls the synchronicity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bruce Smith, at the time, was the president of ComSat’s [Communication Satellite Corporation] Technology Products Group, and, as an officer of ComSat, had been one of the original partners on the board for SBS, so he had certainly had the same sort of thoughts in his head as he looked at what SBS had done wrong, how they had missed, and he saw what was happening from a regulatory standpoint, and was, in his own mind, thinking about the economic dislocations that would occur as a result of the break-up of the Bell System. He decided that he was not a big corporate guy and really wanted to go grow something on his own, and sent letters out to the venture community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first meeting, a lunch, was scheduled for April 1, 1983, Fools Day, even though MacLean would not be able to attend. Smith remembers the conversation with Chrisman, Forkish and Gill:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They described to me a product that they had come to in different ways: Walt out of installing a lot of datacom product in the microwave business and believing that there was an opportunity for products that interconnected in complex ways, topologies that weren’t point-to-point. At this point in time, nobody had a non-point-to-point product. So he came to it from an applications standpoint, where I came to it from a more broad environmental standpoint. Roger and Robbie had come to the idea that a box could be made which would largely be a data engine, and that perception was driven primarily out of the Tymnet perception that a network can be built around nodal engines. The rest of the world thought that, by the time you get smart, you had central office switches, or you had point products like PBXs that functioned independently – same thing with multiplexers that basically functioned independently of all the other ones that might be someplace else. So the Tymnet people had this concept of interconnectivity which is not at all different than the perception I had because of the time division multiple access way you manage satellite communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith and MacLean met soon afterwards in Washington, D.C. and had a similar meeting of the minds. Numerous phone calls followed until Smith and Gill mutually committed to joining the now credible enterprise in May. Three venture capital funds advanced $150, 000 so space could be leased and minimal offices assembled. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We created a strategic statement of what it was the business was about, which was that the thousand largest companies worldwide, 600 in the US, were going, over time, as the world deregulated, to need a product which would allow them to interconnect this new, increasingly cheap, sets of bandwidth; that, at the beginning, bandwidth wouldn’t be cheap so the ability to interconnect it and use it efficiently was important, and using it efficiently meant voice and voice compression; that as bandwidth prices fell, efficiency of use would be less of an issue, but the ability to handle very complex topologies would become the issue – all of this in the concept of what this thing was as a manager of a fixed plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of a manager of fixed plant emerged out of the deregulation of telecommunications, changing technological alternatives, and the growing importance of information to corporate management. Again Smith:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The overwhelming thing that underlies the conceptual framework for NET. was my perception that what had happened, or what would happen, would be a move from call/minute type economic thought to a fixed plant utilization type of thought, i.e. a fixed price, or cost, transportation plant that would be put in place for a variety of reasons and get increasingly close to the central production of business services in the company, but where the economic advantage, if you will, was in managing that fixed plant more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To know that they were not just talking to themselves, MacLean called on friends and former business associates and arranged for a trip back east in July to talk to decision makers of potential customers. Appreciatively Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Audrey, by some dint of magic, managed to set up a round robin trip for us, which included meeting with the telecom and information executives of some of the really major US companies, and we went out and we sat down with these people and just simply talked about their needs – talked about where they thought their businesses were going, and by the time we finished that trip, not only had we heard every single one of them say:  “I don’t believe you can do it, but if you can do it I’ll buy a truckload.” We also began to comprehend the speed with which the applications environment was changing on these people. We got a real clear sense of fear – fear of the break-up, fear of costs rising, and fear of this enormous growth in demand without any ability to predict it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had a vision, they had the facts and they quickly finalized an operating plan. In August 1983, Oak Management Corporation; Merrill, Pickard, Anderson and Eyre; and J.H. Whitney &amp;amp; Company invested $4.4 million with a pre-money valuation of $2.1 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;   Technically they incorporated as MetroLink, a name that MacLean insisted sounded like a sausage vendor. Smith, in typical let’s-get-this-decided-and-move-on, told the pregnant MacLean that she could not sit or excuse herself until the name question was settled. So a question that had nagged the group from the beginning took minutes to solve and Network Equipment Technologies was as if delivered. In September, Gill and Forkish started hiring engineers and the real work of clarifying and specifying the product began. Smith remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the early year or so it was all the engineering founders and then Walt, with me in the other direction having some conversations around and about, but there was a lot of architectural ‘What problem are we trying to solve?’ ‘How will that problem change over time?’ kinds of things at the front end of this, which probably came more from the fact that the people did not work together before, did not have common wisdom.  Therefore, these things had to be settled.  Out of that came a much stronger idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacLean recalls the diversity of the talent they soon had sitting around the table:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NET was the only place where, really, you had X-25, data networking, voice telephony, speech processing and transmission backgrounds, all assembled from the early stage of the design effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would make NET’s T-1 multiplexer unique was a space time architecture that emerged principally from the interpenetration of Smith’s understanding of satellite TDMA designs and Gill’s knowledge of large TELCO switch architectures. The result would be an approach that allowed NET to build larger multiplexers providing much higher availability and with the intelligence to handle more complex topologies than any competitive product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Network Equipment Technologies (NET) fixed plant manager, metaphorically thought of as the new railroad switch, switched circuits not packets. The design strongly reflected Smith’s knowledge of satellite TDMA architectures learned at Comsat and Gill’s familiarity with large TELCO switches, a design that would permit NET to build much large nodes and handle much more complex network topologies than the competition. Forkish remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We never got stuck in the mode of debating the ‘connection versus connectionless’ issue because in a circuit switch it seemed pretty obvious that we would build connection oriented sessions. We wanted to be innovative, but we wanted to use proven technology in being innovative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the engineers teased every implication out of their concepts before building hardware or writing software, Smith fleshed out the plans for the organization, including the major, but seemingly obvious to him, decision to create direct sales and field service organizations. MacLean remembers with admiration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bruce built the kind of financial structure for the company that enabled him to build the sort of direct sales and service capability that I think was as critical to the success of NET as was the technology base. In order for us to really take a walk between the giants’ toes, the giants being IBM and AT&amp;amp;T, we would need to run faster, and furthermore we would need to have our own ability to deliver solutions to the end users who were all Blue Chip companies and expected us to have first tier funding, deep pockets, and the kind of documentation, training and service support that they knew needed to accompany a product that was going to sit strategically in the backbone of their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As confident as they were all becoming, there always existed the nagging concern that one of the leading Data Communication firms might introduce a product to better the one they were developing. Then in early 1984, they received an invitation to hear about the new T-1 multiplexer being introduced by Timeplex. They almost did not want to attend the presentation, fearing that their hopes to be first to market had been seriously dashed. Forkish remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Timeplex had just announced their Link/1 product. There were people who thought that we should simply pack up our bags: Timeplex was going to walk away with this market and we shouldn’t even try. We attended a briefing in Santa Clara. They were describing what their product was going to do and be like. As we sat in the room, we noticed that people asked them questions about T-1. One of the questions was ‘How are they going to treat red and yellow alarms?’ Very standard in T-1s. Not only did they not know the answer, they didn’t understand the questions, and it was real clear to us that there was an opportunity whether Timeplex had a Link/1 or not, and it was that meeting, that Timeplex briefing, that we sort of became very encouraged again. We had a new resolve. We didn’t think of them as a threat, so we charged right off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The will to constrain jumping in and creating a product until the product had been fully thought through soon paid big dividends. Forkish remembers with pride:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We actually coded the entire system in about six months. It was one of the most satisfying efforts I’ve been involved in. It was highly focused and well directed, but we had a charter and a goal, and we had developed precisely, or at least reasonably close, to where we thought we’d end up. In the first year, I was not at all a manager. I was very much a leader, if you can draw a distinction between those two. I was as much leading the ‘charge of the light brigade’ as anything, and that simply set up circumstances that can never be duplicated except in the environment of a start-up and creating something out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacLean may have been pregnant, but she was not going to let any overlooked possibility derail the success they were all beginning to feel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I talked to a couple of presidents of large PBX companies at the time, and I saw that they were really perceptually frozen in this view of the PBX being the office controller, and I don’t think they could see the fact that there was an opportunity for someone to focus on the transmission management problem and offer value to all the PBXs in a way that left the user an autonomy of selection of PBXs. In fact, if you look at Intercom, they failed because they tried to do something similar to what we did, but included in it the PBX functionality, whereas we consciously stayed at the physical layer, did not usurp the addressing and routing functions of either the PBX or the front-end processor, because we knew that we could coexist with them if we strictly focused on adding intelligence to the transmission layer of the problem. So, I think that there’s the perceptual frozen-ness that keeps the mainframe from inventing the mini, from inventing the micro, and the same thing happened here, where the PBX guys thought they were going to control the world and the data guys thought that they were better than the PBX guys, and nobody was really thinking about the integrated problem, I think, in a way that was able to come in and not displace the installed bases that everybody had, but add value to it. Most of them were too intent on protecting their own product strategies, and that sort of myopic focus can really get you locked in to where you miss seeing an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;September 1984, the time had come to beta test their Integrated Digital Network Exchange (IDNX) on a customer’s premises. Two design choices that had both immediate and long-lasting competitive implications were voice compression and dynamic routing. Forkish first remembers their successful implementation of the yet to-be-standardized ADPCM and the advantages of working with a company wise to beta testing a product as any start-up. Forkish remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were very fortunate early on in having, as I guess would have to be the case, the customers by their nature were risk takers and they were also very supportive. They had some of their own prestige on the line of course. We had worked very hard and had a lot of pride in our voice processing capabilities and our voice compression was also a key differentiator. In fact, it was internally integrated to the system, but there were no standards for ADPCM at the time, so we decided instead of waiting, we were going to go with a proprietary approach. Well, there were concerns about what quality would be like, so the folks at Bankers Trust did what they called their Pepsi test. They sent a note through all their user organizations that said: “Starting in two weeks, on a Tuesday, we’re going to convert from PCM to ADPCM. Please let us know what you think,” and then they did it the next day. Sure enough, two weeks later they got complaints about ‘the quality is worse today than it was yesterday,’ and they said:  “Oh, by the way, we did it two weeks ago. We’ll see what happened last night.”  So they solved the problem of managing their own users in a very clever and creative way, and it’s interesting that the end user and the vendor had to be creative working together to make the installation a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To NET designers, dynamic routing meant much more than not forcing a customer to reconfigure hardware in the case of a circuit failure. They wanted the IDNX to re-route so quickly that the customer did not even know it had happened. Forkish remembers in 1988:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thing that I felt very strongly about was not only that we should come out in the first release with rerouting capabilities, but the rerouting should be fast enough to largely make a failure in the network transparent. We gave demonstrations, the most impressive of which had two brokers talking on a phone and we were able to break a T1, have them be rerouted, and they didn’t know it had happened, and they were both from New York, which meant they were both talking at the same time, and we were able to demonstrate time and time again that the difference between fast rerouting and slow rerouting is not necessarily one simply that’s an incremental measure, but it’s the difference between a conversation being disconnected or continuing. It’s the difference between a host to host session having to be disconnected, go through restart procedures, or having a momentary pause in its transmission, and I think it’s that concept and what we ultimately dubbed ‘Applications Availability’ that became the key differentiator for NET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Smith and his financial officer, Thomas Rota, had begun the arduous process of raising more money. Exactly how much depended on their corporate strategy. Some investors balked on hearing how much would have to be raised to build a direct sales and a field service organization, money that would undoubtedly result in dilution and a feared lower return on their investment. Smith recalls the loggerhead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The board of directors thought I was absolutely out of my mind, that the amount of money and dilution we’d have to tolerate was such that it was a whacko thing to do. My view was that “I’ll settle for a smaller piece of a larger pie, thank you very much, but I don’t know how to do this any other way,” and we got down to the point where I basically said:  “If you want to run the business, you can do that. This is the only way I know how to make it successful, and I’m prepared to step aside if you don’t like that,” and that solved that. It was a necessary step on this particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1984, NET raised a second round of venture capital totaling $7.5 million. The pre-money valuation was $15.0 million. NET had become a hot investment in no small measure due to Smith’s ardor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think an entrepreneur, to start one of these companies, at least to the point where he hasn’t been successful with one before, and where he doesn’t have a very fat bank account, has got to have a concept that he can believe in with almost a religious fervor. I believed that we had correctly identified the opportunity. I’m sure the investment community has a terrible time telling the difference between somebody who is religious and somebody who is a promoter, and then in those who are religious, which ones are right and which ones are not. I believe that that fervor was broadly shared in the company. We thought we understood the business better than anybody else on earth, and probably we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With money in the bank, a satisfied beta customer and a product ready for introduction, Smith staged another of his larger than life events, one meant to raise fear in their competitors and to inspire confidence in their potential customers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We now had the operational problem which was ‘how do you convince a big company – a guy in a big company – to take a potentially career-limiting risk and put the lifeblood of his business in the hands of some wacky group of people from California that had not been in business for a year?’ Well the answer to that is you start developing a larger- than-life image. You convey the perception of credibility; you grab associated credibility wherever you can. We did our product announcement in New York at Morgan Stanley’s corporate auditorium, with a seminar with the likes of Howard Anderson of the Yankee Group and Dixon Doll and Alan Pearce and Dick Wiley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NET began shipping IDNXs in January 1985. The IDNX qualifies as the first truly networking T-1 multiplexer (The Timeplex Link/1 could create only minimally complex networks). A networking multiplexer differed from the point-to-point multiplexers in the complexity of networks that could be created and the embedded management control required. (See Exhibit 11.5 Example of an IDNX T-1 Multiplexer Network) Some of the key features that would distinguish the IDNX are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Demand assigned bandwidth allocation – calls could be set up on demand and bandwidth was used only for the duration of call.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dynamic alternate routing – no operator intervention was necessary&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Flexible network topologies&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Reliable system architecture&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sophisticated voice compression – 32 Kbits ADPCM available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-13141-example-of-an-net-idnx-t-1-multiplexer-network&quot;&gt;Exhibit 13.14.1 Example of an NET IDNX T-1 Multiplexer Network&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/clip_image002_0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of an NET IDNX T-1 Multiplexer Network&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their first full fiscal year ending March 1986, NET’s sales totaled an astonishing $8.7 million. An impressive accomplishment given that Timeplex sold $11 million of its Link/1 in its first year and Timeplex had the advantage of an existing sales force and distribution network. Nevertheless, NET still loss $6.2 million, indicative of the considerable expense of building sales and support organizations.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

After further deliberation, strongly influenced by those he recruited to join him and the feedback he received from potential investors, Caisse changed the product opportunity Cohesive Networks would target. Like NET, Cohesive Networks would focus on developing a high-end T-1 multiplexer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After closing a $2.8 million first round of venture capital, Cohesive took office space a short drive from NET. Reflecting on the competitive spirit that motivated each company, a spirit reminiscent of that between Ungermann-Bass and Sytek, Forkish of NET remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had, I think, respect, fear, and dislike all at the same time for Cohesive, because we knew we were going to compete with them. From day one, when we got our funding, we knew that the enemy was Cohesive, and I think both companies probably made it into more of an enemy type perception than they had to, but it was also part of our feel for motivation. We simply were not going to be beaten by those guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 1985, Cohesive Networks had closed a $7.5 million second round of financing and began selling its CN-1; a T-1 multiplexer positioned essentially head-on against NET’s IDNX. Only NET held a key advantage, it was already shipping product. Cohesive Network management, feeling the need to generate credibility and to ramp sales faster than they were projecting, began discussing the idea of OEMing their product to a number of leading data communication companies. Meetings were held with Codex, by then dissatisfied with its Avanti product, Amdahl and General DataComm (GDC). By the spring of 1985 a lucrative deal was signed with GDC, one calling for GDC to buy $40 million of CN-1s. GDC began selling the CN-1 in September 1985 as the MegaSwitch. Cohesive Network sales for calendar year 1985, however, were a disappointing $1.5 million with a loss of roughly $5 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

NSS also targeted the product opportunity for a high-end networking multiplexer and although NSS held the advantage of better market data, it also bore the huge disadvantage of being later to initiate product development. NSS management believed they held an ace up their sleeve, however, for their product would combine the benefits of both circuit and packet switching. Zucchino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I realized that we [Tymnet] needed circuit switched capability as well as the packet switch – to handle [IBM’s Systems Network Architecture] SNA, for example.

Infotron also intended to become an OEM and to integrate NSS’s advanced technology into its own Infostream 1500/2000 T-1 multiplexer that it had announced in December 1984. NSS projected it would begin shipping beta units of their N16 high capacity digital switch in the third quarter of 1985.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Although not technically a spinout of Tymnet, there was an important connection. Audrey Maclean remembers the meeting that she, Bruce Smith and Walt Gill had had with MCI during their July 1983 tour to collect market data and meet with potential customers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the places we went was to MCI, because we wanted to also understand their perspective, in terms of what their users were asking for. We had a series of conversations under non-disclosure with MCI, and then two or three people that had been included in those discussions left MCI, and they went out and formed Spectrum Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the red-hot excitement being generated by the prospects for the T-1 market within the investment community, Spectrum Digital went public in May 1985; even though Spectrum Digital was not expected to ship its NET-1.5 T-1 multiplexer until the second quarter of 1986. The NET-1.5 was targeted at the low end of the high-end of the market and could be configured as an inexpensive point-to-point T-1 multiplexer. In the fall of 1985, following the lead of Cohesive Networks and NSS, Spectrum Digital embarked on an OEM strategy signing Paradyne as its domestic partner and Marconi for overseas distribution. Eyeing the opportunities before them, Spectrum Digital management realized they needed $6 million to complete the NET-1.5. Only they had to go back to private investors and, in so doing so ran afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After resolving the legal difficulties, Spectrum brought in new management, including a new president, Joseph Pisula, formerly a vice president of Timeplex, and closed a private round of $15 million in 1986. Unfortunately, their problems caused two other OEMs, Racal Milgo and Infinet (formerly Intertel) to end their agreements and, to keep from losing Paradyne they had to give Paradyne exclusive manufacturing rights.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.16/Samples-of-Experts'-Opinions/",

As digital facilities have become more prevalent (private microwave, satellite, and TDS [Terrestrial Digital Services] services from AT&amp;amp;T) the multiplexer’s role has shifted to become a gateway to the wideband digital world. The Yankee Group believes that the multiplexer market will grow to $305 million in 1984. The most significant growth will come in the T-1 multiplexer market segment, which will grow 75% to $68 million in 1984.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1985, a report based on actual case histories titled “Private Network Strategies” identified some of the reasons corporations were beginning to build their own wide area communication networks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yankee Group observed specific trends in the area of communications management:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Many users are just beginning to use communications strategically;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Planned growth of data communications needs far exceeds that for voice communications;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The integration of voice and data, on both a facilities and managerial level, is a top priority among many users;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vendor dissatisfaction is growing.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the vendor dissatisfaction, the report further writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vendors should interact, not react;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vendors should provide a single point of contact for the user;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vendor contacts should be accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same month, from another report titled “Network Switching:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Yankee Group believes network switches are the key to network communications and control and, hence, are the key to network equipment vendor dominance.

Nordin remembers the problems of developing a networking switch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had a product called the Netlink, which was a point-to-point product, a very good product. But, frankly, we didn’t have the engineering resources and perhaps to an extent the vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So never one to put off to tomorrow what needs to be done today, Nordin made contact with the two leading start-ups, Network Equipment Technologies (NET) and Cohesive Networks. In his meetings with them, he urged them to weigh the advantages of joining forces with a pubic company, one with a significant market presence. Craig Huffaker, vice president of finance of DCA, remembers that NET had begun thinking about going public and investment bankers, including Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons, had convinced them they would be a hot deal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bert [Nordin] actually talked with both firms about acquisition and we could have done either one. But, Bert was adverse to paying the kind of price tag NET thought they were worth, so we went to Cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The management of NET was not interested in the rumored $100 million being offered by DCA, especially when access to the public capital markets capital was being dangled before them. Nordin’s conversations with Cohesive Networks, on the other hand, quickly found traction, The OEM deal with GDC had proved a failure and Cohesive Network management knew they were falling behind their archrival NET and, more pressingly, were running out of cash. Rumors abound about a potential deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that same summer, Smith of NET had contacted Caisse at Cohesive a number of times to request that they stop using edited NET materials in selling situations. Caisse proved uncooperative. Finally, NET filed a lawsuit demanding an end to the practices. As DCA was finalizing their plans to acquire Cohesive, they had one of their lawyers contact Smith to both understand the basis for the lawsuit in Smith’s words and possibly find a solution. Once understanding the situation, Nordin agreed to destroy the offending documents and cease the practices and NET settled the suit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1986, DCA bought Cohesive Networks. Instantly, DCA was seen as a market leader able to challenge Timeplex and NET.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.24/Network-Equipment-Technologies/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The head of steam that NET management had been promising for the last two years became self-evident to insiders during the first half of 1986. In March, NET announced its second product the IDNX/40. The IDNX/40 sold for $45,000 – $70,000 depending on the configuration, roughly half the sales price of the IDNX/70. In early April, management told the board that revenues topped $8.7 million for its first full fiscal year. The good news would continue. Their sales ramp rate was so fast, NET became profitable in April 1986 with revenues of $6.7 million for the quarter ending June 1986 and profits of $400 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Smith, the President and CEO, remembers not only why NET was successful, but why the competition was not:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You take my product and you compare my box with the Cohesive box, I have some advantages. Take the networks that I can build and the certainty I can provide for critical applications, and get a customer to think about his whole problem, I win hands down almost all the time. The company was designed that way, and the product was designed to fit into that sort of an architectural concept, and I think that credit needs to be shared among all of the early people, in terms of reaching up into that next level. You talked about the second generation;  ‘what is this thing really, what’s the layer beyond the layer I would think about?’ Culturally, I think that’s the thing that differentiated us from our competitors. I think it’s the cultural limitation that meant that the General Datacomm’s didn’t make it. We defined the problem differently. That’s the issue. It is the attacker’s advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacking meant leaving no sales on the table. Management was learning that when customers created their new networks using IDNX’s, they almost always had to buy more statistical multiplexers and other slower speed data communication equipment. But since NET did not manufacture such equipment, the customers had to buy product from other Data Communication firms that not only meant giving competitors business, but also leaving the door open for them to convince the customer to buy their T-1 multiplexers, not NET’s. This was a problem that had to be solved if NET was going to be seen as a full service network provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1986, wasting no time, NET acquired ComDesign, Inc. of Santa Barbara, CA for $6.2 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;   Bob Dolan had founded ComDesign in 1977 to build LAN products, that was, until he heard about Micom. Dolan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I saw this little company, Micom, that was making a killing of $5 million and then $15 million fiscal years selling statmuxs, I thought “That’s kind of great, but it doesn’t do that much. It’s kind of a trivial thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1986, ComDesign had revenues of $12 million but had not attained a scale that gave management or investors confidence that they would ever become a public company. So when NET came courting, the conversations progressed quickly, particularly when they learned that NET intended to go public as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, NET had also filed a lawsuit against Cohesive Networks to cease use NET proprietary information that had been edited and used against them in selling situations. After DCA investigated the lawsuit and had their lawyer discuss the matter with Smith, Nordin of DCA agreed to stop the practices and NET withdrew the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NET’s sales growth continued to impress investment bankers and conversations to go public resulted in the preparation of the prospectus. In January 1987, NET became a public company, raising $26 million with a post money valuation of nearly $200 million. Investor demand soon drove the stock price to $27.00 per share, valuing NET at greater than $300 million. (Venture investors who originally bought shares at $.0166 realized a 96,285 percent return and those who bought shares at $.75 in June 1986 realized a 2,033 percent return.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year ending March 1987, NET’s sales were $47.4 million, representing a growth rate of 450%. Profits totaled $5.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the winners go the spoils and, on June 16, 1987, NET and IBM announced terms of an agreement between their two companies. IBM would begin selling the NET products under a non-exclusive worldwide marketing, installation and service agreement. IBM would also contribute funding to future NET product development and incorporate NET technology into its networking products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Richard Kimball, the research analyst covering NET for Montgomery Securities would write on June 24:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We believe the stock will continue to command a significant premium based on robust market growth, the company’s product and management abilities to fully exploit these strong markets, and the fact that earnings are expected to almost quadruple in fiscal 1988, expand over 60% in fiscal 1989and more that 40% long term.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 1986, executives of Codex knew their T-1 multiplexer strategy had serious problems. The rapidly growing T-1 market was approaching $200 million and they were stuck participating in the marginalized point-to-point segment with their product OEMed from Avanti. Codex needed a networking multiplexer if they were going to be a credible factor in supplying large corporations – their target market – with the network switches they needed to build out their WANs. Any doubts they may have had were instantly swept away in September, when they learned that DCA had acquired Cohesive Networks. It felt as if they were drowning with no life raft in sight. They needed to act and act quickly. But what were the options? The idea of buying Timeplex took pride out of their souls, let alone the painful thought of having to negotiate a deal with Botwinick, CEO of Timeplex. Botwinick might argue that he, yes he, as if he were Timeplex, should buy Codex. Quick phone calls confirmed their fears that NET was not for sale. In fact, NET was discussing going public. How could they, Codex, the Data Communication giant, have so misjudged and mismanaged a market opportunity so close to their core? They needed inspiration and they needed it fast! Fortunately the investment bankers of Montgomery Securities introduced an option. One that would look increasingly better after every meeting: Stratacom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratacom was founded in January 1986, although technically it was the final stage in the legal reorganization of Packet Technologies. (AMOCO, the Oil Company and sole financial backer of Packet Technologies, resisted the company’s efforts to raise more money. AMOCO eventually relented, giving a spinout the right to sell a T-1 multiplexer, a technology it considered unimportant.) Packet Technologies, founded in 1983 by a team including Paul Baran, had initially planned to build products enabling two-way communications over cable networks. Then out of conversations with Michigan Bell came the idea of building a more efficient product for intra-central office T-1 communications. Not surprisingly, therefore, the T-1 multiplexer that the spin-off Stratacom was beginning to sell was based on packet switching, a very different architecture than the circuit switching of all the existing T-1 multiplexers being sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex had two things Stratacom was in short supply of: capital and distribution. So in the early spring of 1987, Codex invested $2.5 million in Stratacom and agreed to cap their ownership of Stratacom to no more than 20%. Codex, in turn, gained worldwide rights to market, install and service Stratacom’s Integrated Packet Exchange (IPX) T-1 multiplexer. In 1987, Stratacom had revenues of $5.3 million. Sales of $3.2 million to Codex represented 60% of their sales. Reflecting the ever higher costs of market entry, Stratacom lost $6.0 million. Codex had secured the rights to a networking multiplexer, but sales of $3.2 million of an OEM product hardly made them a market force.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/13.26/Micom/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Micom management was not oblivious of the T-1 market. They read the same reports as everyone else. They simply thought that their customers did not require the bandwidth of T-1 and, in any case, they had more than enough on their plate to pursue a new major product direction. The acquisition of Interlan in 1985 and its integration was proving all-consuming. Then in the spring of 1987, Bill Norred decided it was time to step down and give management control to Roger Evans, who became President and CEO. In the Annual Report for 1987, dated May 28, 1987, Evans and his new management team wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We plan to enter the T-1 market and widen our product line during fiscal 1988 to address this market, the most rapidly growing segment of the data communications market today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then just as they had with LANs, Micom entered the T-1 market by acquisition, taking on the struggling Spectrum Digital for $19.4 million. Evans comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we had embarked on a T-1 product development plan two years ago, we would for sure have tailored it to a lower end application and I don’t think it would have been successful. The Spectrum product is ideal for our requirements, because our customers have smaller networking applications, but they are technically astute buyers in a way that the typical IBM customer isn’t so much. So what we spec’ed, and then found Spectrum met, was an NET level of functionality in a smaller package, and I couldn’t be more delighted with the technology we found as a fit for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their problems would be more than a product, however, as noted in an article in Data Communications in August 1987:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Micom must overcome a lack of experience in T-1 networking and a shortage of qualified sales personnel to be successful in the very competitive market.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1986, the sales of T-1 multiplexers continued to be a bonanza for Timeplex. After sales of $48 million in 1985, sales soared 66% to $80 million in 1986. Timeplex continued to command about one-third of the total market. In the spring of 1986, they also announced their next flagship T-1 multiplexer - the Link/2. Two improved features in the Link/2 were support for digitized voice and CBXs. Surprisingly, the Link/2 did not increase the number of T-1 circuits that could be switched - 6 circuits - even as the new high-end switches of NET, the IDNX, could switch 32 circuits and Cohesive Networks, the CN-1, could switch 15 circuits. Market data in mid-1986 reported that the average-sized network was 26 nodes and many companies were expanding their networks to 50 to 100 nodes.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;   Had Timeplex misread the market or had they chosen to focus on their traditional mid-sized accounts? Edward Botwinick, Chairman and CEO, when interviewed in June 1986 said:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is a lot bigger than I would have told you a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botwinick further implied that Timeplex might announce a larger switch in 1987, but still it would take a couple of years for it to reach the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then rumors of a potentially industry altering alignment began to circulating in early 1987, Timeplex was nearing an agreement with IBM. Imagine then the shock in June, when NET and IBM announced their joint marketing and development agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botwinick and Timeplex reacted quickly. First came the introduction of its Unified Network Management System. Then came the Link/100 networking switch, able to switch 144 T-1 circuits and 15,000 input/output ports. Timeplex showed no signs of falling behind. Knowing they needed to create credibility fast, rumors appeared in Data Communications in July, for example:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Usually reliable rumormongers say that T1 industry leader Timeplex Inc., still rattling from IBM’s tapping of arch-competitor Network Equipment Technologies as its vanguard into the T1 arena, is itself looking to team up with a leading computer power. And the target reportedly is Digital Equipment Corp. If such a technological and marketing marriage does make it to the altar, there could end up being three major players in T1 data networking and network management: IBM/NET/SNA/Netview, et al; AT&amp;amp;T; and DEC and Timeplex/Timeview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to secure a partner made sense; only DEC proved yet another rumor without substance. On November 19, 1987, Unisys, the mainframe computer conglomerate, announced it was acquiring Timeplex in a stock swap valued at $307 million. Computer and communications, communications and computers, emerging and merging in order to both survive and grow.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In the short span of four years, from the beginning of 1984 to the end of 1987, the sales of T-1 multiplexers skyrocketed by a factor of ten: $30 million to $300 million. The Data Communication firms that once thought themselves heir to “their” multiplexer market would, by 1987, be pushed aside by an entrepreneurial start-up – NET – and an encroaching computer giant - Unisys (Timeplex). During these same years, sales of their former engine of growth, statistical multiplexers, had peaked and were shrinking fast. In 1988 sales of statistical multiplexers would total less than $200 million, a far cry form the $900 million predicted in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition from analog to digital transmission, and the consequent demand for T-1 multiplexers, represented a much more profound shift than the firms of Data Communications had in mind. For once corporations had invested in T-1 multiplexers and tasted the cost savings and their many strategic advantages; they began demanding products with capabilities that they once looked to AT&amp;amp;T for. Products providing adaptive routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and automatic backup for example. These new capabilities far exceeded the concepts of network management that had evolved for the point-to-point data networks constructed using modems and statistical multiplexers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as much of an advance as the new networking T-1 multiplexers were, with one sole exception, they were based on circuit switching. This may have made sense in the beginning, but as these WANs were expected to interconnect LANs, circuit switching began to exhibit the same problems that had motivated the creation of the first computer network: the Arpanet. Computer and LAN traffic was burst-like in nature and did not fit ideally within the confines of fixed circuits, no matter how fast they could be switched. As of mid-1987, these problems were beginning to be recognized and the T-1 multiplexer firms started reacting. Only they would not be fast enough, a story that fills the last chapter of this history: Internetworking. Again entrepreneurs without the baggage of existing customers innovated the products that at first seemed to co-exist with T-1 multiplexers. And then began absorbing T-1 as simply the physical layer protocol it had always been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;t-1-multiplexer-market-1981-1989--millions&quot;&gt;T-1 Multiplexer Market 1981 1989 ($ Millions)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By 1985, the surge of local area network (LAN) installations by corporations was transforming the “weed-like” phenomenon swelling departmental budgets into corporate reorganizations creating IT departments promising strategic opportunities and competitive advantage. To leverage the full capability of LANs first meant that corporations had to connect all their computers to LANs and then interconnect all their LANs into all-encompassing enterprise networks. Entering 1987, the promise of enterprise networks remained just that: a promising vision, not a viable capital investment. But by the end of 1988, most of the issues had been resolved and the emergence of the third wave of computer communications – Internetworking – was underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early public demonstration of how interconnecting LANs would revolutionize business was the MAP demonstration at NCC in July 1984. While successful, the participants also realized just how much more remained to be done. A more ambitious demonstration of both the transport and network layers of the MAP and TOP OSI protocol stacks was scheduled for the Autofact trade show in 1985. Again much was learned and new goals were set that would culminate in another public demonstration in June 1988 at the Enterprise Networking Event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative to the OSI protocols were those that had been birthed and shepherded by DARPA: TCP/IP. Only the Federal Government made clear in 1987 that in the future all networks would be interconnected using OSI not TCP/IP. A handful of renegades, and vendors needing to ship product, refused to abandon ship. At the Interop trade shows of 1988, TCP/IP proved robust and viable despite the decisions that OSI would be the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning as early as 1983, entrepreneurs were eyeing the interconnection of LANs as an attractive market opportunity. Venture capitalists, flush with money, readily agreed. The first products of internetworking were limited in functionality, needing the Network Layer protocols to truly provide transparent interconnection. By the end of 1988, the eventual dominant firms of Internetworking – cisco Systems and Wellfleet – had already begun shipping products and dozens of others had entered the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need of corporations to interconnect their computers into ever-expanding and inclusive networks left unmistakable consequences on the evolution of the Data Communications and Networking markets. By the end of 1988, no firm observed in this history escaped transformation, as they struggled to succeed and even to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now to the conclusion of the early history of Computer Communications: an ending crafted as much by historical accidents as by prophetic visions.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/14.1/Interconnecting-Local-Area-Networks-(LANs)/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By 1986, corporate Information Technology (IT) managers no longer needed to be sold on the benefits of interconnecting their computers into networks. In a report issued a few years later, in 1988, the preeminent market research firm, Dataquest, estimated that at yearend 1985 there were 560,000 installed Ethernet LAN connections.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  Assuming five LAN connections, or computers, per network gives an estimated 100,000 Ethernet networks. In 1986, there were 650,000 Ethernet LAN connections shipped, likely doubling the number of Ethernet networks. The same would hold true for 1987 when 1,260,000 Ethernet LAN connections shipped. The market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) reported similar, only slightly more conservation numbers in 1987.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc2&quot; href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;  IDC estimated an installed base domestically of 27 million personal computers in business environments in 1987 with only 11% connected in LANs. They projected the number of personal computers in business environments to swell to 38 million by 1989 with 28% of them attached to LANs – a 65% growth rate over the 6.6 million personal computers attached to LANs in 1988. No wonder corporate IT managers felt the need to interconnect their networks into ever-larger networks, making it possible for more users to share information and peripherals and communicate using email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interconnecting LANs throughout large corporations with distant facilities introduced problems different than simply interconnecting local LANs. Even as late as the mid-1980’s, unless LANs were from the same vendor, interconnecting them was far from simple. Decisions had to be made as to whether to force all LANs to conform to the same standards, i.e. Ethernet, some other version of CSMA/CD, token ring, a proprietary standard of a preferred vendor, etc. and also conform to the same communication protocols, i.e. TCP/IP, DECnet, XNS, Novels Netware, etc., that in themselves could vary dramatically from one vendor’s implementation to another. To cite another major problem, the communication speeds of LANs could not be supported by modems, the predominant devices used to interconnect to distant facilities. A solution could force major installation costs, such as upgrading to T-1 facilities or upgrading to sophisticated protocol software such as TCP/IP. Or should IT managers recommend waiting for the coming OSI protocols?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While corporate IT managers first encountered these issues in the 1983-1984 timeframe, computer scientists and researchers affiliated with ARPA had confronted them more than a decade earlier when the NCP software of the Arpanet required upgrading. In 1972-1973, the ARPA computer scientists first faced the challenges of interconnecting vastly different networks, such as radio networks, to the Arpanet. Those requirements precipitated years of debate within communication committees and standards bodies, such as INWG, IFIP Working Group 6.1 and ISO TC 97/SC 16. (See Chapters 4, 6 and 7) In addition to government and NGO activities, corporations, such as Xerox, IBM, and DEC, also had explored how to interconnect LANs. The most productive efforts took place at Xerox PARC with the creation of large Ethernet networks using first PUP and then XNS protocols. During these years there had been conversations of how to interconnect networks, but it always seemed too far in the future to resolve when there was work to be done to create the products and infrastructure needed to successfully convince corporations to use LANs. Two universities, Stanford and M.I.T, were also on the forefront of interconnecting LANs, and their researchers will enter this history later in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate IT managers and vendors had labored with years of uncertainty over how to create the best communication networks. Helpful had been the nearly universal agreement as to the lower four layers of the OSI Reference Model, the layers that dealt with creating reliable communications between computing devices. (See Exhibit 12.0 The OSI Reference Model) Nevertheless it had taken years to sort out first the specific standards of the Data Link Layer and then the Transport Layer, and then commercially successful products. During this period, the problems had been how to get one LAN network working “perfectly.” But by 1983-1984, corporations wanted to interconnect their growing number of LANs (see Chapter 10) and sudden appearance of WANs (see Chapter 11), and thus the sudden importance of the Network Layer standards; standards that had been thought hammered out, but not incorporated into products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1411-the-osi-reference-model&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.1.1 The OSI Reference Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Transport&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Provides reliable end-to-end connections&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TCP&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Network&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Provides addressing and routing for the network&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data Link&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Provides media error control and addresses for multi-access media&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ethernet&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Physical&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Provides for physical connectivity&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Coaxial Cable&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter observes the formative economic history of the organizations and products of Internetworking. The important products were: local and remote bridges, gateways and routers. Of particular interest will be how the political institutions prioritized the creation of gateways whereas the economic institutions – again primarily venture capital-backed start-ups – raced ahead with routers. By the end of 1988, routers are on the verge of becoming the most economically important, and transformative, products of Computer Communications.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Repeaters are amplifiers able to boost a decaying LAN signal so it can travel the length of connected LAN(s). Neither complicated nor expensive, repeaters function entirely on the Physical Layer of the OSI Reference Model. (See Exhibit 12.1 The Ethernet Repeater) Their simplicity also gives rise to a fundamental limitation: they boost every signal as if locked in broadcast mode. Thus, all the traffic on one LAN continues onto the next, cumulatively, quickly degrading the performance of the interconnected LANs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1421-the-ethernet-repeater&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.2.1 The Ethernet Repeater&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.2.1_ethernet_repeater.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of an Ethernet Repeater&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incremental innovation yielded modest repeater improvements, e.g. the ability to detect faults in a connected LAN and isolating the offending LAN. Repeaters, however, could never overcome the limitations inherent in not knowing the source and destination addresses of connected devices. Nor could repeaters ever interconnect different types of LANs, such as Ethernet and token ring. These limitations combined with the compelling economic advantages of interconnecting networks, motivated vendors to take on the more complex, hence expensive, task of innovating the first real product of Internetworking: bridges.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc3&quot; href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By making use of the information contained in the Data Link Layer, bridges offer major improvements over repeaters. The price to be paid, however, is a much more expensive and complex product than the repeater; a product necessarily containing logic and memory. Furthermore, host computers will have to encapsulate the data to be sent in a packet(s) containing, at a minimum, the information of the Data Link Layer. That information includes both the source and destination addresses as well as important supervisory bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridges, also known as Medium Access Control (MAC) bridges, use the source and destination addresses in packets to build tables of what addresses have come on what interfaces, or links. Afterwards, if it receives a packet with destination addresses that are in the table, the bridge only sends the packets using the interfaces it has seen the source addresses come from. It will not send the packets down all interfaces. Early in there evolution bridges were called “learning bridges,” although the tables bridges built were in no sense routing tables. The tables did contribute to the store-and-forward functionality designed into the relay logic of bridges. (See Exhibit 14.3.1 A Networking Bridge) These rudimentary tables were an initial step in the creation of “intelligent” internetworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1431-a-networking-bridge&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.3.1 A Networking Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.3.1_networking_bridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of A Networking Bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to read and use the address information in packets, or datagrams, give bridges even more advantages. If the destination address is on the network originating the packet, then the packet need not be forwarded to other networks, thereby further reducing network traffic. This ability also enables users to subdivide an existing network to improve the performance of both new networks. For example, if a network includes both engineering workstations and office PCs, a bridge used to isolate these different types of computers onto two new networks will likely improve the performance of both new networks. Bridges could also interconnect devices on incompatible networks as long as they conformed to the same Data Link standards, albeit the functionality would be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, bridges were connected in hierarchical topologies known as spanning trees, working best when the LANs were only Ethernet. (See Exhibit 12.3 A Bridge Spanning Tree Network Topology) Spanning tree networks permit multiple connections between bridges, but only connections that do not create loops. There is no calculation of an optimum path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1432-a-bridge-spanning-tree-network-topology&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.3.2 A Bridge Spanning Tree Network Topology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.3.2_networking_bridge_spanning_tree.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of A Bridge Spanning Tree&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The address information contained in the Data Link Layer assumes that there is only one wire, or media. When a new network is connected to an existing bridge-based network, all node addresses have to be validated for uniqueness and changed if not. This can become an administrative nightmare as bridge-based networks expand in size and include incompatible networks, such as DECnet or AppleTalk. The processing efficiency of bridges also reached an effective maximum of between thirty and fifty nodes, depending on the mix of LANs and distribution of nodes.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc4&quot; href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;  Nevertheless, since bridges do not examine or use any information in the Layers above the Data Link Layer, bridges are exceptionally fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limiting characteristic of bridges is transparency. Transparency refers to the fact that connected Hosts do not need to address bridge(s) specifically but can simply launch Data Link Layer constructed packets. At first this would seem to be an advantage, but as the needs of networks grew more sophisticated, Hosts would need to address the Internetworking product. Lastly, since bridges know only node source and destination addresses, bridge tables are but a static representation of a network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc5&quot; href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;  Bridges cannot route packets around congested or failed links (or interfaces), an important requirement for a robust network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as considerable as the advantages of bridges are, not being able to route dynamically nor truly accommodate multi-protocols, bridges could not meet the needs of corporations and institutions wanting to create geographically dispersed, large enterprise networks.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the United States (Cerf and Kahn), France (Pouzin), and elsewhere had explored the possibilities of interconnecting different types of packet networks. In 1979, the notion of a network-independent layer had been formalized into the Network Layer in the OSI Reference Model. The architectural challenges of interconnecting multiple networks intensified in the early 1980s with the explosion of different network types such as LANs (Ethernet, token ring, etc.), T-1, X.25, DECnet, for example. Network designers hoped to create Internetworking devices that could support multiple protocols, provide dynamic packet routing around changing line (or link) conditions, and ensure that packets could be routed over links of limited speed. In addition, the addressing had to include the addresses of the source and destination network, as well as devices. This multi-level addressing is similar to postal codes that include the street addresses of senders and recipients as well as the corresponding cities, and even states and countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1441--network-layer-subnetwork-interconnection&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.4.1 – Network Layer Subnetwork Interconnection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.4.1_network_layer_connection.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Network Layer Subnetwork Interconnection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSI Reference Model described “Intermediate Systems,” which were Internetworking devices that could implement the Network Layer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc6&quot; href=&quot;#fn6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  Intermediate Systems use all the information contained in the headers of packets and can create new protocols between themselves that allow sophisticated forms of control and security beyond the basic relay and routing functions. (See Exhibit 12.4 Network Layer Subnetwork Interconnection)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subnetworks connecting Intermediate Systems and End Systems can be as many and as diverse as needed to construct a cost effective and reliable enterprise network, a corporate network consisting of many networks. Subnetworks range in complexity from a serial line to unlimited combinations of LANs and WANs. During the mid-1980s, companies brought two new types of Internetworking products to the market: gateways and routers. Products fulfilling the functions that OSI defined for Intermediate Systems. With time, companies realized that building and selling gateways was no simple task. As witnessed, a vast variety of installed LAN and WAN networks existed, and gateway manufacturers struggled to build products that could both interconnect existing networks and anticipate future needs. Yet the continuing demand to communicate packets between networks gave rise to a simpler class of devices, called routers, which were first introduced by Proteon and cisco Systems. Not until 1987 did market research firms begin reporting on this new market sector: Internetworking.

Routers functioned with protocols at the Network Layer, whereas the more sophisticated gateways integrated the higher-level Layers of once-incompatible computing environments such as DECNET and IBM’s SNA.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc7&quot; href=&quot;#fn7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;  (See Exhibit 12.6, Internetworking Devices in the OSI Model)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, industry observers brimmed with excitement over the quickening pace of Internetworking evolution and the promising markets for bridges, routers, and gateways. The driving forces were customer demand and global competition, especially among young companies and entrepreneurs who recognized these new opportunities.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc8&quot; href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;  The facilitating framework was ISO’s OSI model and the standards that OSI committees were producing at all levels of the seven-layer OSI Reference Model. As the Internetworking market became reality, only a few questions remained: What companies would capture market leadership? Would IBM commit fully to the momentum of OSI? And, most crucially for customers, how soon would they be able to buy OSI-compliant products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1443--internetworking-devices-in-the-osi--dod-models&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.4.3 – Internetworking Devices in the OSI &amp;amp; DoD Models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.4.3_internetworking_devices.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Internetworking Devices in the OSI &amp;amp; DoD Models&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two organizations in the U.S. government, ARPA (or DARPA), within the Department of Defense, and the NBS (or as known after August 1988 the NIST), within the Department of Commerce, proved especially influential.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense funded networking research as early as the mid 1960s, primarily through ARPA. The anecdote from 1966 (see Chapter 2.7, Planning the ARPANET), where ARPA-IPTO Director Robert Taylor had three different terminals on his desk to access three different incompatible computers, indicated a broader problem. ARPA’s subsequent sponsorship of the Arpanet and other computer research aimed to solve this problem that market forces alone was not solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the 1960s and the 1980s, IPTO funding nurtured a community of expert users and network designers who, over time, spread knowledge of packet switching in universities, private companies, and start-ups. Nevertheless, the plague of incompatibility was unrelenting as ARPA and many other organizations designed and built new networks. ARPA sponsored Cerf and Kahn’s development of TCP during the 1970s in order to interconnect diverse ARPA packet switched networks. One outcome was the division of TCP into TCP/IP. In the early 1980s, the DoD continued to support TCP/IP protocols by adopting them as DoD standards and by issuing contracts to BBN, MIT, Berkeley, UCLA, and Washington to code TCP/IP implementations for popular operating systems such as UNIX and IBM’s various operating systems (see Chapter 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect of this patronage was to leapfrog market forces and push TCP/IP into operational use. Such a strategy proved far more efficient than battling with the likes of IBM, Xerox, Honeywell, and foreign governments and computer companies in national and international standards bodies. The singleness of purpose by behind TCP/IP by ARPA contrasted favorably with the invariably competing strategies of the organizations and corporations promoting OSI. Thus the DoD had accepted TCP/IP as military standards, whereas the NBS was still promoting the incompatible OSI protocols as standards. To resolve the impasse, in May 1983 the two agencies jointly asked the National Research Council (NRC) to compare TCP with TP-4, the OSI connectionless transport protocol. Nearly two years passed before the study was completed. The NRC interviewed Arpanet insiders such as Jon Postel and Vint Cerf who “gave testimony on behalf of TCP,” as well as representatives from IBM, DEC, and the NBS who “gave a lot of testimony on behalf of OSI.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc10&quot; href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NRC’s February 1985 report, “Transport Protocols for Department of Defense Data Networks,” was a decisive contribution to the global consensus building around OSI. The report recommended that the DoD “immediately adopt” TP-4 as co-standard with TCP, “and move ultimately toward exclusive use” of OSI protocols.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc11&quot; href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;  Although the committee found few functional differences between TCP and TP-4, Assistant Secretary of Defense Donald C. Latham sent the report to the Director of the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) with a strategic observation that was unambiguous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whenever international [OSI] standards are available and can be used to support military requirements, they will be implemented as rapidly as possible to obtain maximum economic and interoperability benefits.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc12&quot; href=&quot;#fn12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a catch: since the OSI protocols were “not available at this time” as a “commercial offering,” Latham underscored the NRC’s advice to “insure that industry is aware of DoD needs as TP is commercially implemented.” He also recommended that the DCA send representatives to standards committees “that are currently refining TP under the auspices of the National Bureau of Standards,” to ensure that the DCA prepare adequate testing facilities and transition plans for “when commercial implementations are available.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc13&quot; href=&quot;#fn13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1985 NRC report was one of many indications in the mid-1980s that TCP/IP would be subsumed by OSI. To this point, the growth of TCP/IP had not been a function of market forces, but rather of the continued sponsorship of the U.S. government. Such sponsorship had served TCP/IP’s promoters well for the purposes of research and implementation. But as OSI gained support amongst vendors, standards committees, and large customers—including the very U.S. government agencies that sponsored TCP/IP—leaders in the TCP/IP community saw the need to improve and promote their protocols more aggressively if they were to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promotional strategies of the Internet Advisory Board (IAB) had two components: encourage more participation in TCP/IP standards development; and teach equipment vendors about the features and advantages of TCP/IP. 1986 was a crucial year for both efforts.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc14&quot; href=&quot;#fn14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the IAB’s Gateway Algorithms Task Force split into two new groups. The Internet Architecture Task Force (INARC) would focus on long-term architectural matters, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) on the Internet’s short-term operational and protocol engineering problems. Mike Corrigan of the Defense Data Network chaired the first meeting of the IETF in January 1986, with 20 other attendees. The IETF met 3 more times in 1986 (with an average of 25 attendees per meeting), 4 times in 1987 (with an average of 70 attendees per meeting), and 3 times in 1988 (with an average of 103 attendees per meeting).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc15&quot; href=&quot;#fn15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;  The expansion of the Internet technical community bore immediate fruit, such as the May 1986 publication of RFC 985, “Requirements for Internet Gateways.” This document, while not a standard, was a clear set of guidelines for TCP/IP gateway implementations that was a joint effort of the IAB, INARC, IETF, and the Gateway Requirements Subcommittee of the National Science Foundation’s Network Technical Advisory Group. The latter body guided the development of the NSFNET, a TCP/IP network that generated substantial political and technical support for the IAB.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc16&quot; href=&quot;#fn16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Lynch’s outreach campaign in 1986 would prove to be even more important than technical developments within the TCP/IP research community. Lynch, who was instrumental in managing the Arpanet’s transition to TCP in 1983, was now a consultant. He worked with the IAB to plan a workshop in Monterrey, California and invited equipment vendors to learn about TCP/IP. Lynch saw the event as an attempt to get “the apostles of TCP to come out of their ivory towers” and provide some guidance for vendors implementing their protocols.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc17&quot; href=&quot;#fn17&quot;&gt;17/a&amp;gt; Lynch recalls:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dozen or two dozen who actually built this stuff, I went to them and said: ‘You guys have failed. You built this beautiful thing, and the world is starting to use it, and they’re abusing it, and you have failed to communicate to them what its real potency is, where it’s really headed, what problems it’s really headed to solve. They’re just using it for these little small things, and you’ve got to go awaken them.’ And they did. They loved that. They said, ‘sure.’ …So I put together a conference [in Monterey in August of ‘86], invitation only… That was an outrageously successful conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects, Lynch and his fellow TCP/IP supporters were playing PR – public relations - catch-up: OSI had already attracted support from the DoD and the NBS, prompting Data Communications to declare in November 1985 that OSI was “heading for full bloom.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc18&quot; href=&quot;#fn18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaders of the TCP/IP research community joined representatives from 65 vendors such as Ungermann-Bass and Excelan in attending the first “TCP/IP Vendors Workshop” on August 25-27, 1986. The meeting, while successful, did not settle the question of who would be responsible for ensuring that all TCP/IP-based products implemented the protocols in a consistent manner. Vendor representatives were disappointed that no certification and conformance testing process existed. Some, such as Judith Estrin at Bridge Communications, rejected Lynch’s proposal to create a “Protocol Testing Institute” as “too grandiose.” Estrin and others believed that Lynch or a new, informal group lacked the authority to declare any TCP/IP implementation as an industry standard.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc19&quot; href=&quot;#fn19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;  Moreover, Lynch’s initiative would not bring stability to Internetworking markets. A marketing manager at Ungermann-Bass, Barton Burstein, summarized the problem in 1987:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the OSI side there’s no product. At MAP, GM has funded a very large technical staff. COS [Corporation for Open Systems] has a tremendous budget. Then look at TCP/IP with its number of customers and vendors. It’s five to six times more dense or populous than OSI, and you’ve got Dan Lynch and his answering machine.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch’s belief in TCP/IP, experience as a consultant to Excelan, and entrepreneurial spirit pushed him along. He continued organizing vendor conferences to promote TCP, including the “TCP/IP Interoperability Conference” in Monterrey on March 16-19, 1987; the “2nd TCP/IP Interoperability Conference” in Arlington, Virginia on December 1-4, 1987; and the “TCP/IP Interoperability Exhibition and Solutions Showcase” in Santa Clara on September 28-30, 1988. Lynch debuted a new, catchier title for the 1988 conference: Interop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch also promoted TCP/IP through a newsletter, Connexions: The Interoperability Report, which he described as an “attempt to satisfy the need for information exchange between users, vendors, and the R&amp;amp;D community.” His editorial advisory board contained four leaders of TCP/IP development: Vint Cerf, David Clark, David Mills, and Jon Postel. The premier issue in 1987 contained articles on Internet RFCs, an explanation of gateways (to “unravel the mysteries of what is at first glance a simple concept”), and listed over 140 vendors that were offering or developing TCP/IP products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc21&quot; href=&quot;#fn21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the while, officials in the NBS were working hard to provide nourishment for the American companies that would bring OSI products to market.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In January 1979, the NBS hired John Heafner to manage a newly created Systems and Network Architecture Division (SNAD) of the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology (ICST) of NBS. All Federal Government local area networking and OSI standards responsibility would thereafter reside in SNAD. Heafner explains the action of the U. S. Congress:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NBS has a mandate from Congress to provide standards for ADP {automated data processing}, communications and so forth. It’s part of their role. The program was reviewed here at NBS in the mid-to-late ’70s, as to why they hadn’t done anything significant, and the answer coming out of that was: “Yes, they haven’t done anything significant, and the reason is they don’t have enough funding.” In 1978, the budget was trebled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heafner was well prepared for his new assignment. In 1969, he was responsible for connecting RAND to the Arpanet. When the ARPA sponsored research group at RAND, led by the visionary Keith Uncapher, spun out in 1972 to become the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) affiliated with the University of Southern California, Heafner joined ISI. He then worked at ISI until he moved to the NBS in 1979. Thus he was well aware of many of the dynamics impacting the strategy he would need to fashion, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The obvious fact that the Federal Government was going to buy a lot of computers and increasingly want those computers to share information;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;IBM, the largest vendor of computers to the Federal Government, had zealously protected its proprietary software, including its communication protocols that did not have a Network Protocol like TCP/IP or the planned protocols of OSI; and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The uncertain outcomes of the considerable investment and knowledge the DoD had in the TCP/IP protocols.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heafner remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sort of the way I put it when I came here is that we will have won when DoD buys OSI from IBM. We will have covered all the bases, getting the largest supplier to supply to the largest consumer, and do it in a standardized way. Our thrust from the beginning was to work in ISO, and to some extent in CCITT, to make sure that government needs were covered when those protocols were being developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 1982, NBS held meetings with companies to learn how to move OSI forward, including the use of the recently formulated Manufacturing Automation Protocols (MAP).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc22&quot; href=&quot;#fn22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;  MAP was a defined subset of OSI protocols championed by General Motors. It was clear that a public demonstration of the OSI protocols might force companies to commit to OSI, produce OSI products, and assure their products all worked together, somehow. At the first Implementors Workshop meeting in February 1983 at the facilities of the NBS, the date was set for a public demonstration: the National Computer Conference (NCC) in June 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heafner aired a proposal one evening at NCC to solve a problem vexing vendors: products that would not interoperate. He recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I presented a white paper proposing the OSINET to the vendors participating in the NCC ‘84 in Las Vegas. At that time, it was called the NBS-CatNet, or concatenated network. It was just several pages of notes, proposing: “Do you want to continue this work?” Vendors do not want to key up for a demo every year or two or whatever. What we needed was some sandbox where we could really play and do inter-operation testing, and develop the test technology and methodology behind all of this. What was envisioned was a sandbox to play in, and that’s what the OSINET is today. I credit Maris Graube with that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of year 1984, the NBS finalized its first Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 107) titled: Local Area Networks: Baseband Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications and Link Layer Protocol.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc23&quot; href=&quot;#fn23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;  Considerable savings in government expenses were expected, as well as fewer future network integration problems, e.g., instead of every agency continuing to purchase LANs that would some day be unable to be interconnected with other LANs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc24&quot; href=&quot;#fn24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;  Rosenthal, who had participated in the process from the very first IEEE 802 meeting in February 1980, remembers with pride in 1988:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is what I make: a Federal Information Processing Standard. It’s the only one that we have in networking in the government right now: Dated 1984, October 31st, and titled: Local Area Networks: Baseband Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications and Link Layer Protocol – a mandatory procurement and standard. I told IEEE to let the world know, and put the fact on their cover for 802.3 and portions of 802.2. That’s what this does. So I won at the game. I made the rules, played the game, and I won.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc25&quot; href=&quot;#fn25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for the twenty-one companies that had committed to demonstrating OSI protocols at Autofact ‘85 and, therefore of winning, was to create products that could pass the conformance tests of OSI standards. As it would turn out, conformance testing was a very tall order. Even at that, conformance did not mean interoperability. And there might not have been any tests at all if not for the cooperation between NBS and the participating companies, i.e. the private sector. Mulvenna explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is an area of government/industry cooperation. When we developed the ‘internet’ protocol for the test system for the Autofact, we couldn’t do it. We didn’t have all the in-house resources to do it. Three companies, Intel, Honeywell and NCR, sent us people to work here full time at NBS for four or five months, to develop the test system that we needed to test out the ‘internet’ protocol at Autofact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","footnotes" : [{

We had to get a commitment of the CEOs, somebody with signature authority, had to be able to say: “Here’s the check, you make it happen. Pull out all the stops. OSI is important. Make it happen.” We had to get the technical people to ask the question: “Make what happen?” We had to say: “Make this happen,” and we had to lay it out for them. They came back to us immediately and said: “There’s too many options here.” A DEC guy says: “I’m going to implement it this way, and the IBM guy’s going to implement it that way, and we’re at different altitudes.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The organizers of the OSI demonstration knew they needed to prove to the ‘world’ that OSI worked; that customers could now buy products to implement MAP, TOP and internetworking solutions. Such solutions were directed at large manufacturers wanting to achieve productivity gains comparable to those attained in their office systems. General Motors, for example, bought equipment from over 100 vendors but lacked standards: hence its substantial support of MAP.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc26&quot; href=&quot;#fn26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;  Customers (such as GM) that used a variety of information systems and networks would buy the next generation of internetworking products as long as it was clear that the ultimate goal of interoperability would be met. The OSI demonstration organizers felt both the pressure to make OSI launched and the weight of so much to do. There remained all the work left unfinished from NCC, the added complexity of integrating numerous interconnected networks, as well as the goal of substantially scaling up the sophistication of the demonstration. The good news was they would have their audience: the show drew a record 30,000 people with approximately 200 vendors exhibiting MAP-compatible and automation products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc27&quot; href=&quot;#fn27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSI demonstration interconnected two locations: Detroit, MI and London, England. In Cobb Hall, Detroit, there were three LANS: two token bus LANs, one from Concord Data Systems and one from INI, and a CSMA/CD LAN. These three LANs supported MAP and TOP applications as if one integrated LAN. They, in turn, were connected to a X.25 public data network that connected them “seamlessly” to another 5 Mbps Concord Data Systems token bus LAN in London. (See Exhibit 12.7 Autofact ’85 OSI Demonstration Layout) In addition to data processing equipment such as computers and terminals, a variety of factory automation devices, including robots, vision systems and engineering workstations, let customers play three different applications: a custom designed version of the ancient game Towers of Hanoi, or Hot Potato or an interactive FTAM application.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc28&quot; href=&quot;#fn28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;  The twenty-one companies demonstrating equipment were able to communicate across all five interconnected networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc29&quot; href=&quot;#fn29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A later NBS publication would describe the demonstration as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using OSI protocols, Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) and Technical and Office Protocol (TOP), the participating companies integrated a simulated small-scale factory operation, supported by office systems. The MAP systems, designed for the plant floor, and the TOP systems, designed for the engineering and office applications, were connected for information exchange.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc30&quot; href=&quot;#fn30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1471-autofact-85-osi-demonstration-layout&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.7.1 Autofact ’85 OSI Demonstration Layout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.7.1_autofact_1985_tradeshow_layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Autofact 1985 Tradeshow Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridges, Routers and Gateways, the Intermediate systems, interconnected the different networks. (See Exhibit 12.8 1984 NCC and Autofact ’85 OSI Implementations) In that Exhibit, a router is used to connect a MAP end system to a TOP end system; both use the connectionless Network and Transport Layer protocols. Gateways, needed to support Layer 7 applications, could convert from IBM, DEC, proprietary or TCP/IP file structures to ISO FTAM. As shown, the use of ISO FTAM, ISO transport Class 4 (the TCP-equivalent protocol) and ISO CLNS brought the state of networking close to the initial objectives set by the NBS, and much further along than the demonstration at NCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While well attended and considered a success (“GM’s MAP steals show at Autofact”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc31&quot; href=&quot;#fn31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;), even outsiders recognized demonstrations were different than working products for sale (“On the show floor, there are plenty of demonstrations but few available products”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc32&quot; href=&quot;#fn32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;). Again, the NBS and MAP/TOP organizers had work to do and, in the case of, the NBS work they did not want to do. To-date, the NBS had played a key role in converting the OSI “connectionless” protocols of the Network and Transport Layers to Intermediate Systems against which the vendors could test their implementations. Ensuring that incompatible computer-based systems could exchange information might be an appropriate responsibility for the NBS. Continuing to be responsible for creating test systems for the Upper Layers of the OSI Model, however, was beyond the mandate of the NBS. The NBS, not wanting to bail on the overall project, concluded it could help in four ways: continue to host the Implementors Workshops, finish the work required for a functioning OSINET, continue testing gateways/routers on OSINET, and spin the NBS testing tools and methodologies off into a new organization(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1472-1984-ncc-and-autofact-1985-osi-implementations&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.7.2 1984 NCC and Autofact 1985 OSI Implementations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.7.2_ncc_1984_and_autofact_1985_osi_implementation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of 1984 NCC and Autofact 1985 OSI Implementations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corporate organizers also had their “plates full,” so if everyone’s attention and time were to be maintained, they had no time to waste.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;OSINET development was behind schedule since needed resources had been reassigned to Autofact.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc33&quot; href=&quot;#fn33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; With the demonstration now over, NBS changed its budget priorities as well as solicited resources from voluntary participants; those who grasped the importance of a functioning OSINET. The objectives of OSINET were to: verify tests results, facilitate vendor-to-vendor testing and perform OSI research. Vendors connected to the NBS test gateways using the Accunet X.25 network – recently created to interconnect the London and Detroit-based demonstrations of Autofact ‘85. One gateway enabled participating vendors to test if their products conformed to X.25, token bus and CSMA/CD compliant implementations, as well as supportive applications: such as converting FTAM to ISO FTAM. A second gateway was essential for the support, and hopefully the cooperation, of the DoD. It translated TCP/IP and OSI protocols, at least as far as the constraints of both protocols allowed. Any Government agency and organization supporting OSINET could use these gateways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulvenna, then responsible for OSINET, later described the organizations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OSINET is an organization of vendors and users that use an X-25 network as the backbone to test and demonstrate OSI protocols. It arose out of the need, in 1984 and 1985, when the vendors were getting together in one place and saying: “There’s got to be a better way of at least running the interoperability testing of our products. Vendors are supporting and using OSINET because they want to be able to simulate the real live environment in which their products are going to be marketed….Vendors, who will be selling competing products in the marketplace, cooperating with each other, because they realize it is in their own best interest to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSINET consisted of three elements: the OSINET network, a steering committee to manage the network and all the OSINET projects, and a technical committee to carry out the technical work assigned by the steering committee. Into 1988, NBS chaired the steering committee, operated an information center, administered the testing, and provided assistance to Federal Government agencies wishing to join OSINET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To administer conformance and interoperability testing, the NBS used the gateway prototyped during Autofact ’85. (See Exhibit 12.9 OSI Testing Gateway) A typical vendor conformance test required a vendor to pre-arrange with the NBS the tests it needed for its implementations. At the arranged time, the end user would connect to a testing gateway at NBS using the Accunet X.25 network. They then could test their implementations for OSI conformance. Tests included the first four layers of the ISO Model for X.25, token bus and CSMA/CD. ISO FTAM testing was separate. In this sense, the NBS served as the certifying organization for OSINET members for the first four layers of the ISO Model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSINET could also meet the need for vendor-to-vendor interoperability testing. Vendors first prearranged tests. Once they interconnected their products over OSINET, they could each run tests against the others’ implementations. Customers might also require all of its vendors to pass NBS tests of interoperability. These tests reduced, even minimized, much of risks of buying OSI implementations that might not interoperate with those from other vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1481-osi-testing-gateway&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.8.1 OSI Testing Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.8.1_osi_testing_gateway.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of OSI Testing Gateway&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSINET members also had access to a gateway the NBS had created for the DoD to convert TCP/IP protocols to those of OSI. (See Exhibit 12.10 OSI/DoD Gateway Protocol Suites) Mulvenna remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We also have developed our application layer gateway here at NBS, which will transform the OSI protocols to the DOD protocols. It is to help the TCP/IP world move toward, and work with, the OSI world, to push them, gently, in the direction of OSI. The gateway will be available to both the DOD users and the OSI users on OSINET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While conformance and interoperability testing, as well as TCP/IP-to-OSI conversion testing, was necessary, it was far from sufficient. An obvious barrier to market success was the growing installed base of TCP/IP implementations; i.e., a customer already successfully using TCP/IP products would be less likely to replace working software.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc34&quot; href=&quot;#fn34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;  Another problem could come from those customers wanting seven-Layer interoperability tests, not just the four-Layer tests developed and supported by the NBS. The NBS, however, had been clear that it was not going to perform similar roles for layers five through seven. It had enough to do, such as persuading the DoD to adopt OSI? To be responsible to the needs of vendors, the NBS created a non-profit organization, the Corporation for Open Systems (COS) to which it transferred non-exclusive rights of all its testing and gateway intellectual property and some of the related assets. COS would satisfy user needs for layers five to seven services. How quickly this could happen is reminiscent of 1979, when Congress finally trebled the budget for LAN and OSI standards. Only in 1985, the political climate was for government to shrink, not grow. Rosenthal opined in 1988:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fundamental concept was NBS had all this test technology, and Reagan had a privatization mindset, and still does, so what better thing than to try to get COS out of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1482-osidod-gateway-protocol-suites&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.8.2 OSI/DoD Gateway Protocol Suites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.8.2_osi-dod_gateway_protocol_suites.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of OSI/DoD Gateway Protocol Suites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc35&quot; href=&quot;#fn35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COS would be the first of two initial recipients of the NBS testing tools and methodologies. Announced in the first quarter of 1986, the trade press warmly received the news.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc36&quot; href=&quot;#fn36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;  There were still questions, such as would IBM participate, but the prevailing reaction was positive. It would now be up to COS “to develop a consistent set of specifications, test methods and services for all OSI layers and application protocols.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc37&quot; href=&quot;#fn37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too quickly the initial optimism and hope turned to criticism. Some criticism was justified, such as COS turning down the tools already developed by Europeans; or maybe justified, such as frequently changing the rules of membership. Then there was the appearance of the NBS not having taken some of the problems seriously, such as those it had been trying to solve since 1982. For example, in June 1987, Data Communications Magazine reported that COS had selected TCP/IP for an internal network, not the equivalent OSI protocols. The reason, the computer vendor, SUN Microsystems, did not yet support OSI protocols. A COS researcher, Steve Smith is quoted in Data Communications as saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I realize it may look bad, but we do plan to migrate [to the OSI protocols].&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc38&quot; href=&quot;#fn38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, procurement of computer and networking equipment by the agencies of the Federal Government had continued. The lack of OSI products, as well as the bewildering choices of OSI protocols, encouraged the purchase of proven TCP/IP products. The same factors that inspired the creation of the MAP and TOP Profiles now plagued government procurement. Customers (in this case the Federal Government) wanted to reduce complexity, increase compatibility, and buy products that they could use. After all, the purpose of Internetworking products was to make organizations more efficient and productive. Critical to user adoption, then, was overcoming the confusion that the development of Networking and Internetworking standards had left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve many of these problems, in September 1986, NBS held the initial meeting of government agencies wanting to create a Government OSI Profile, or GOSIP. Representatives from 19 government organizations participated in the effort to “coordinate the acquisition and operation of OSI products by the Federal government.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc39&quot; href=&quot;#fn39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once GOSIP was specified, the plan was for it to become a FIPS. Heafner remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I first got here, the notion was: “Let’s write down all of these specifications and go publish them as soon as we can as FIPS.” Really, I stayed here until I felt my job was done, which was to write the initial GOSIP. That was all that was needed. We don’t need to write, and to republish and re-track and maintain the same standards that ANSI, ISO, CCITT and IEEE are doing. We simply need to write a procurement specification that references that work, and that’s what has been done with GOSIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborations between federal agencies to produce GOSIP proceeded more harmoniously than Mulvenna anticipated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that DOD was a major contributor to GOSIP. You would think that, of all the government agencies, they would have the most at stake in the status quo. That may be true for some of the people at the lower levels, but there has been a recognition by some of the higher people in DOD that OSI is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulvenna also noticed that the DoD agencies were “major contributors to the writing of the GOSIP document, major because they were more informed on the issues than perhaps some of the other government agencies, and they realized the services that the OSI protocols would provide them, because of their work with TCP/IP.” In other words, DoD officials did not take a combative approach to the choice between TCP/IP and OSI. Like many people experienced with Internetworking, they believed that researchers and standards bodies would find ways to make TCP/IP compatible with the more comprehensive capabilities that OSI promised. (See exhibit 12.11 OSI History in the U.S.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant Secretary of Defense Donald C. Latham, who in 1985 had endorsed the NRC’s report recommending the DoD migration from TCP/IP to OSI, confirmed Mulvenna’s interpretation in a July 1987 memo that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;these OSI protocols may be specified in addition to, in lieu of, or as an alternative option to DOD protocols […] They are designated as experimental because of the limited operational experience currently available with the OSI protocols, and the limited operational testing in a security environment concurrently defined in GOSIP. […] It is intended to adopt the OSI protocols as a full co-standard with the DOD protocols when GOSIP is formally approved as a Federal Information Processing Standard. Two years thereafter, the OSI protocols will become the sole mandatory interoperable protocol suite, however, a capability with inter-operation with DOD protocols will be provided for the expected life of systems supporting the DOD protocols.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc40&quot; href=&quot;#fn40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they were disposed toward a more critical interpretation of OSI’s development, Latham, Mulvenna, and other officials in DoD and NBS might have noted that OSI in 1987 was more or less at the same experimental and commercially unavailable stage as it was in 1985. Nevertheless, the staunch support for OSI from the US Federal Government seemed likely to stimulate market development and, therefore, commercial success and user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-1483-osi-history-in-the-us&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.8.3 OSI History in the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.8.3_osi_history_in_united_states.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of OSI History in the U.S.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More encouraging signs were to come in 1988, including the formation of the International Public Sector Information Technology Group to coordinate GOSIPs published by Australia, Canada, Japan, Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.1 In August, the American government published GOSIP as Federal Information Processing Standards 146, Version 1, with the expectation that it would become a federal procurement requirement in August 1990. While FIPS 146 did not mandate that all federal systems migrate immediately or exclusively to OSI, Heafner, Mulvenna, and Rosenthal could at last congratulate themselves for a job well done. They had done their part. Now it was time for vendors to make products conforming with the OSI profiles MAP, TOP, and GOSIP.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

The power of such events did not escape the notice of the promoters of Internetworking standards and products. The chief promoters of the era’s two Internetworking approaches—OSI and TCP/IP—held significant public demonstrations in 1988, on a larger scale than previous gatherings such as the NBS Implementors workshops and Dan Lynch’s TCP/IP Vendors Workshop. Both events shared the same purpose: to convince customers that their quests for network interoperability were over.

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;By the fall of 1986, the NBS might have reviewed its actions since 1982 and concluded that it had largely achieved the vision set out by Heafner in 1979: that the DoD buys OSI from IBM. With IBM having blessed MAP earlier in the year - proxy that IBM would endorse GOSIP and even OSI - and the DoD having made OSI a co-equal standard to TCP/IP in 1985, the unanswered issue remained the availability of competitive OSI products. To incent vendors to build OSI products that interoperated, what better a way than to give contracts for them to do exactly that! Planning for a next big public exhibition began soon after Autofact ’85. Only this time the effort would result not in an OSI demonstration, but an exposition of product interconnected and working seamlessly and, most importantly, available for sale. The Enterprise Networking Event (ENE) scheduled for June 5-9 1988 in Baltimore, Maryland, was to be the final coming out party for OSI networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three groups sponsored ENE: COS, the MAP/TOP Users Group, and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. A total of fifty vendors participated in nine booths, whose sponsors highlighted the event’s focus on large-scale manufacturing: GM, Boeing, TRW, John Deere, the Air Force/Industry Coalition, and Process Industries. COS itself sponsored a booth, as did Britain’s Communication Networking for Manufacturing Applications and the British Department of Trade and Industry (in conjunction with British Telecom).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The build-up to ENE contained a mix of hype, promises, and skepticism that was, by this point, a familiar feature of OSI promotions. ENE’s organizers could boast that the event’s 50 vendors marked a significant jump from 16 vendors at NCC in 1984 and 21 vendors at Autofact ’85. All the American computing giants—including IBM, HP, AT&amp;amp;T, Xerox, Data General, Wang, and Honeywell—would be there, as well as leading European manufacturers and a number of smaller and younger Internetworking companies such as 3Com, Apple, SUN Microsystems, Micom, Retix, and Touch Communications.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc41&quot; href=&quot;#fn41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;  Keynote speakers from the upper levels of the Department of Defense, Arthur Andersen, and the Commission of European Communities would reinforce the message that all major stakeholders were behind the global adoption of OSI.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc42&quot; href=&quot;#fn42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference and exposition spotlighted MAP/TOP Version 3.0. An April article in Data Communications touted the new capabilities in TOP 3.0, which had thus far been cast as the “weaker sibling of the more acclaimed MAP… With Version 3.0, however the tables may be turned. TOP has a strong chance of outdistancing MAP as well as many single-vendor offerings.” TOP’s new capabilities included standardized, multi-vendor applications such as graphical data interchange, electronic mail, remote file access, remote terminal access, network directories, and—significantly for beleaguered system administrators—network management.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc43&quot; href=&quot;#fn43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;  Conveniently for NBS officials like Jerry Mulvenna, most of the software on display also fit within GOSIP, which would be published as FIPS 146 during the same decisive month of June 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone was convinced that the stars were aligning for the big coming out party of MAP, TOP, and GOSIP. Members of COS grumbled that their annual dues of $200,000 were being wasted, the group was being poorly managed, and plans for COS to offer comprehensive conformance testing at ENE would be delayed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc44&quot; href=&quot;#fn44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;  The lurking fear was that the OSI’s history was repeating itself, and that certified interoperable OSI products would remain unavailable. Critics noted the gulf between “COS promises” and “COS deliveries,” and likened COS to a “sprinter who suffers a hamstring pull out of the starting gate.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc45&quot; href=&quot;#fn45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;  COS became a convenient scapegoat for problems that were endemic throughout 10 years of OSI development: the lack of products, erosion in customer confidence, and annoying tendency for OSI to promise more than it delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENE confirmed both the hopes of OSI’s supporters and the fears of its critics. Vendors were able to demonstrate OSI standards for network management and electronic mail, but the absence of certified conformance testing confirmed that customers would still need to wait for certified OSI products. Instead of products for sale, the estimated 10,000-11,000 attendees saw mostly prototype demonstrations—a marginal improvement on Autofact ’85.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc46&quot; href=&quot;#fn46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;  Even MAP 3.0, presumably the most proven of the OSI profiles, was a disappointment. Experts noted that MAP installations were few and far between, and that MAP performance testing would not exist for another 2 or 3 years.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc47&quot; href=&quot;#fn47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;  Worse still, a conflict over intellectual property between General Motors and the North American MAP/TOP Users Group threatened to destabilize the market further.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc48&quot; href=&quot;#fn48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;  Even “Mini-MAP,” a three-layer version of MAP intended to be simpler, faster, and cheaper than the original, was “discredited” by the end of 1988 because it had yet to be deployed. A MAP consultant, Paul Nelson of Venture Development Corp., admitted “I’m not bullish on the market.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc49&quot; href=&quot;#fn49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some lingering disappointment in the wake of ENE, OSI supporters remained steadfast. They insisted that OSI was maturing, its capabilities were robust, products were appearing, and its support was growing amongst vendors and customers in corporations and governments around the world.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc50&quot; href=&quot;#fn50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would the future of TCP/IP fare better that same historically hot year of 1988?&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The continued growth of the TCP/IP installed base, release of more products by more vendors and accolades from the technical community confused the “very pleasant” transition plans laid out by DOD and NBS to migrate to OSI. The Arpanet veteran David Retz summarized the state of affairs in November 1987:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the end of 1986, there were more than 100 vendor offerings of TCP/IP and its associated DARPA protocols. Moreover, major vendors, including IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), have recently begun to offer TCP/IP as part of their product lines… While the long-term strategic direction taken by most companies is in the implementation of the OSI model and its protocols, TCP/IP appears to be solving the short-term problems of connections between networks, and has been addressing many of the issues that relate to the implementation of ISO protocols on existing networks. Given the inherently long life cycle of communications software, the TCP/IP protocols are expected to continue as a major influence for years to come.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc51&quot; href=&quot;#fn51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, a report from the market research firm Infonetics confirmed that the TCP/IP market was changing rapidly, and that a “dramatic increase in the commercialization of TCP/IP has occurred,” and that increasing numbers of users were seeking solutions to integrate diverse computer equipment and networks. “Every sector of the market is planning to purchase TCP/IP products in the next year,” the report continued. “There is no indication that OSI is affecting purchase intent.” Further, customers still were confused about the functions of bridges and routers, which opened up opportunities for “vendors to enter this market.” Many users had indicated plans to transition from TCP/IP to OSI, but Infonetics concluded, “By the time OSI products are available and proven, considerable investment in TCP/IP will have been made.” Given this investment and the imminent improvements to TCP/IP products, the “compatibility, performance and reliability of OSI products must first be proved through field testing before users will be willing to commit to a substantial investment in OSI.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc52&quot; href=&quot;#fn52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics also wondered about migration paths between installed TCP/IP networks and OSI-compliant protocols. The response of the TCP/IP community came in the form of an Internet RFC specifying a Simple Network Management Protocol, or SNMP.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc53&quot; href=&quot;#fn53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;  In a “show of support for multi-vendor network management,” vendors such as Proteon, cisco Systems, and Wellfleet planned to introduce SNMP-based products at Interop. These products, such as Proteon’s Overview, provided a graphical interface for tools to manage the status of Internetworks and network devices—precisely the type of product that network managers longed for. They also provided simple migration paths for users who would eventually adopt OSI’s Common Management Information Protocol, once it was standardized.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc54&quot; href=&quot;#fn54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interop’s “show network” featured lots of products: “every medium, every bridge box, every router you can imagine,” according to Peter de Vries of the Wollongong Group, which was responsible for the Interop network. The network provided connections between all of the vendors on display, as well as links to NSFNET, the regional BARRNET in San Francisco, and a variety of other networks. Vendors could participate in TCP/IP “bake-offs,” where they could check to see if their equipment interoperated with other vendors’ products. Self-appointed “net police” went so far as to hand out “tickets” to implementations that did not comply with the TCP/IP specifications.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc55&quot; href=&quot;#fn55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects, Interop ’88 was far more successful than ENE. It featured useful products from 54 vendors—slightly more than ENE. The target audiences differed in important ways. Where ENE carried the burden of MAP, TOP, and GOSIP expectations to provide comprehensive solutions for large-scale manufacturing, office, and government procurement, Interop stayed focused on the immediate and narrower problems of network interconnection. In the “age of standards,” as Data Communications declared, this focus on Internetworking product compatibility, interoperability, and connectivity energized the ~5,000 attendees as well as the market for TCP/IP products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc56&quot; href=&quot;#fn56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1988, the Internetworking sector looked poised for growth. The short term seemed to belong to entrepreneurs and venture capital backed start-ups targeting customers persuaded by TCP/IP’s growth and ready to buy product. And while OSI’s proponents in government and industry still struggling to bring OSI products to the market, their strategy to garner a widespread global consensus around the future of Internetworking appeared on the path to success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confusion between OSI and TCP/IP contributed to the unsettled nature typical of the Emergent phase of market development. But below the steady stream of publication headlines highlighting technological confusion or the snipst meeting in January 1986 that they would need to convert TCP/IP to OSI-compatible packets.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc57&quot; href=&quot;#fn57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt; To that end, the IAB and IETF had established Working Groups in 1987 to integrate Internet and OSI technologies for electronic mail, directory services, and fundamental network protocols. And vendors such as 3Com claimed to be motivated by the challenge—and market opportunities—of mapping TCP/IP systems to their OSI equivalents.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc58&quot; href=&quot;#fn58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;  Optimists believed the standards wars were in the past and an harmonious era of Internetworking was just around the corner, as the NBS’s Rosenthal summarized in 1988:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a clear message to industry, to the TCP developers of the world, to begin tooling up for OSI. A very pleasant migration strategy, if you will; very supportive of US industry, just like a new horizon, another goal for industry to reach, very well specified.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc59&quot; href=&quot;#fn59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By yearend 1988, domestic political institutions and organizations had done much to accelerate the emergence of the Computer Communication markets.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc60&quot; href=&quot;#fn60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;  Even so, they had not settled the questions of which communication protocols – OSI or TCP/IP – or high-end Internetworking products – gateways or routers – would dominate? For while political organizations might decide if two technological standards are equivalent, they don’t have the power to dictate which products companies had to buy. Those answers would now be left to the dynamics of market competition, and of firms acting in their own self-interest, not for some greater public good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these years, corporations, the economic agents of interest in this history, had also been active. Most notably, firms of the Networking sector had gained scale as competition favored the successful. Eager for more growth, as well as to protect their customer bases, these firms began entering the Internetworking market. But not before new entrants had staked claim as well, much as the Networking firms had once done to the firms of Data Communications. Would their size overwhelm the advantages timing and focus gave the start-ups? Now for our last observation of some of the decisions the firms of Computer Communications made as the needs of their customers changed, and their need to interconnect their LAN and WAN networks into enterprise networks gained importance, even necessity.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Codex entered 1987 with a new President and an impressive new headquarters. In the spring of 1986, John Lockitt was promoted from within to be President and Chief Executive Officer, ending the run of founder Presidents. Then in September, Codex completed its move into a new, upscale New England red brick, 250 thousand square foot headquarters on a 44-acre site in Canton, MA, referred to as “The Farm,” as it once proudly was. At the close of its 1986 fiscal year, Codex retained claim as the largest company in Computer Communications. Then in early 1987, Codex finished its radical Five Year Strategic Plan by redefining its historical “Fancy Box” strategy, yet without coming to terms with its recent failures of execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under other circumstances Lockittt might even have seemed a perfect choice for President: an engineer and senior vice-president for wide-area network operations. Lockitt had led the development of a successful 6740 statistical multiplexer project, yet it was also under his leadership that Codex failed to develop a T-1 multiplexer. Nevertheless, Motorola executives had suddenly concluded Storey was not forthcoming in disclosing all the costs of developing the Farm and they let him go. Why Storey let himself become so distracted, even confused, with the Farm project is poorly understood, but his desire to create an architectural masterpiece came at an unfortunate time, a fact he as CEO should have known. Not that total costs are ever found on accounting ledgers, for Storey let personal reasons crowd out important corporate duties, and the time he spent on architectural issues was exactly opposite the laser focus of entrepreneurs with venture capitalists oversight who were working tirelessly to create the competition they hoped would dethrone Codex. Companies that would attain market values of hundreds of millions of dollars, creating more capital than the costs of many Farms. Such was the doubtful state-of-affairs Lockett assumed in the spring of 1986; an engineer who was about to have twelve direct senior reports, more than the number of engineers he had been managing. Reflecting the bureaucratic disarray that had become Codex, only three of his new reports were accountable for product development and marketing, i.e. sales and future products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art Carr, President before Storey, and at the time of this interview in April 1988, leading a venture capital start-up, expressed his concern:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Codex, as a strategy, evolved from a product company, to a subsystem company, to a network solution company where they’re at now. The problem now is that they don’t have enough home grown components of that strategy. It seems to me, from a distance, that Codex has got an excellent strategy, financially, but the engineering organization, which in the dawning of my experience there in 1968 was the biggest engine in the world, is now the weakest link in implementing the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electrical engineers and information theorists in Carr’s Codex knew how to modulate and demodulate the waveforms of electrical signals traveling over copper wires into square waves interpreted as bits. They did what even AT&amp;amp;T said could not be done, build a 9600 bps modem.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc61&quot; href=&quot;#fn61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt; The speed had since more than doubled to 19,200 bps, and although Codex had become complacent and briefly lost their role as leader, they had recovered and were again the acknowledged market leader. Modem technology and standards exist in the Physical Layer, or bottom Layer, of the OSI Model. The leading edge of computer communications in 1987 was the domain of computer scientists and network theorists who were pushing the frontier of the Network Layer, the Layer in the OSI Model for interconnecting many networks. These products were called gateways and routers, not modems: products that Codex did not have nor knew how to build.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc62&quot; href=&quot;#fn62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too frequently, when a company relocates to a newer, larger headquarters, it is marketed as positive. Only too often the move contains the seeds of an ominous future. To traverse the long driveway, across rhythmic green grass pastures and scenically landscaped ponds, up to the stunning headquarters of Codex, worthy of Architectural Digest, did not need to be explained, for even the eye of a novice would read the signs of a successful company, not a hungry one fighting for its life. No, it looked as expensive as it was. Symbolically, to call on engineers was a drive across town to far less impressive facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Codex recorded revenue of $389 million. Profits were flat with 1985 as Codex continued to bury the costs of its new headquarters and two technological defeats, instead of enjoying the profits of accustomed technological domination and success. Nevertheless, Codex remained the largest Computer Communication company. For the years 1982-1986, Codex reported an impressive compounded annual growth rate of 18.8%, including the minimal 8% of 1986.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc63&quot; href=&quot;#fn63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company still organized its product accounting as in the past, into three Product Market Segments: Transmission, Wide Area Networking and Local Area Networking. (See Exhibit 12.13 Codex Revenue 1987) Theses categories are similar to those of this book: Data Communications, Networking and Internetworking. The most significant adjustment to better align the two reporting conventions requires moving Statistical Muxes to Data Communications, out of Wide Area Networking.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc64&quot; href=&quot;#fn64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;  Using the U.S. data from Exhibit 12.13 Codex Forecasted Revenue 1987, as proxy for 1986 reveals Codex is still predominantly a lease-line modem company (54.6%) and conclusively a Data Communications company (82.8%).&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc65&quot; href=&quot;#fn65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;  Its domestic share of the lease-line modem market was 44%. Having innovated the 9600 bps lease-line modem in 1968 endowed Codex with a lasting market advantage. However, this advantage had not helped Codex enter either the LAN or T-1 multiplexer markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 14.12.1 Codex Forecasted Revenue 1987&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex-14.12.1_codex_revenue_1987.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Codex Forecasted Revenue 1987&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important tools available for Lockitt to stamp his imprint on the future of Codex was to oversee and approve the Five Year Financial Plan. Completed in early 1987, the focus clearly communicated the rationale for the shift to a more “sophisticated” product marketing strategy than Fancy Boxes, to a business school inspired model of segmented markets, each with their own distinctive make-up. The quadrant labeled Integrated Communications Networks are high-end products sold as network solutions; the market Codex was targeting. The Plan, however, reads less like a recipe for success than a buffet of poorly understood courses. Not to find fault, but to view through the lens of the surrounding history, Lockitt begins his opening Narrative with a minimal acknowledgment of their failures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Codex did not keep pace with the strong growth in the T1 multiplexer market… Codex has also failed to capitalize on the rapid growth in the LAN and X.25 markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locket ends by summarizing his vision as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our long range strategic intent is to exploit each technology in combination with other technologies and to provide optimum solutions for the customer rather than being wedded to a single technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for T-1, the Plan masks the strategy of soon selling an OEM product, one from Stratacom that will replace the one from Avanti, for the short term, that is until they hope to design it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Launch T1 Nodal processor, a network backbone product and required core capability. Maintain significant advanced development efforts early in the planning period that will result in a new generation of T1 circuit/packet switched nodes in the mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for laying bare the opportunity found in the hottest market then emerging?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gateways/Bridges: Invest to provide for homogeneous LANs with agile bandwidth allocation for T1 and STDM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codex seems to come down on the side of OSI, although it never joined COS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OSI continues to gain momentum, with both DEC and IBM demonstrating intent toward compatibility with the standard. Industry spawned standards such as MAP and TOP will gain wider acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Year Financial Plan is the blueprint to guide the actions and decisions of Codex management who embrace the goal of building a $1.1 billion company in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr opines in his interview with the author, around the time that this Plan was being distributed, and not addressing the Plan itself, he said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize, I can’t tell you that if I were running Codex that it would have been different, but what happened was, we got a late start on LANs. That was during my time, and we got basically a no start. I don’t think we saw the significance of T1. We didn’t see the tariff changes, the significance of it. When we did, we bought product from Avanti, and again, it was a la the old Micom days. The theory was, buy from Avanti and design them out. The first step was, they were going to enhance Avanti, going beyond Avanti’s design, and then design them out. The same thing had been true in a number of other things since then. What’s happening, in my judgment, seeing from the outside, and I don’t know the details, Codex is depending entirely too much on buy-out product, as opposed to what it’s doing inside, and they’ve got a monumental organization down here in Canton that isn’t turning out the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was selling internally developed products so important? Profits, or more precisely gross margins. Buy-out products are lucky to command a 40% gross margin whereas internally developed ones should earn gross margins of at least 60%. That difference in profits earned, 50%, can mean success and failure: it is extremely difficult to finance product development on the lower gross margins of buy-out products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc66&quot; href=&quot;#fn66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the end of 1988, two announcements seem to undermine Codex’s Five-Year Plan. On July 25, 1988, Network World ran a front-page article titled: “Struggling Codex trims work force.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc67&quot; href=&quot;#fn67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;  Not the banner of a prosperous business behemoth. It reads that 250 employees out of a work force of 4,500 were laid off, a 6% reduction. Continuing it states that Codex probably “overestimated” sales of T-1 multiplexers. It would seem the deal with Stratacom had failed, just as the earlier LAN agreement with Ungermann-Bass had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in December, Codex announced a 30% price reduction for its modems, forced to do so by IBM’s pricing.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc68&quot; href=&quot;#fn68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition was forcing changes even more drastic than lower product prices or reduced headcount: that same December 1988, Codex announced that it was putting its headquarters up for sale.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc69&quot; href=&quot;#fn69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Although posting a slightly better year than 1986 (sales were up 4% and earnings up 13%), make no mistake: 1987 had been a very difficult year for Micom. The dataPBX business was drying up with no prospect for recovery. The market for statistical multiplexers also showed every sign of having had their day in the sun. In fact, the concept of selling products, a marketing distinction of Micom, pointed to becoming a smaller company and selling systems seemed fraught with high risks and major organizational changes; all elements that had scared Bill Norred, founder and past President and now Chairman of the Board, and major shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1988, Norred and two other major shareholders became concerned for the value of their shares and pressured the Board to either buy their shares in a friendly transaction or threatened sale to other buyers. (As major shareholders it was not possible to sell their shares without adversely affecting the share price and thus the value of all their remaining shares.) Roger Evans, President and CEO, would rather not have had to deal with this problem given the precarious nature of the business, but worked hard to find a solution for his long-standing friend and the stability of the company’s share price. By early April, Evans had secured the necessary financing and Micom announced a tender offer for 4.8 million shares of stock at $16 per share. (Norred, and Mr. and Mrs. Thornton, would be selling a total of 4.194 shares.) Then on April 13, Micom announced a delay in the commencement of the offer until after April 26, with the offer subsequently remaining open for 20 business days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In offering to buyback shares, Micom had unintentionally opened itself up to being acquired. Before the tender offer had barely begun, the Board announced that it had received offers from an undisclosed number of unidentified suitors. (Since the prices being proposed were above the prevailing market price of $13.50, the Board had the fiduciary responsibility on behalf of all shareholders to explore the offers.) The Board announced it had taken three steps: a committee of the Board had been established to study the offers, the services of the investment banks Goldman Sachs &amp;amp; Co., and Volpe &amp;amp; Covington had been retained and the tender offer had been cancelled.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc70&quot; href=&quot;#fn70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;  In early August, Micom announced it had entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by a company formed by Odyssey Partners, a major leveraged buyout firm. The all cash offer translated into the purchase of each outstanding share of Micom for $16.00/share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including fees, expenses and refinancing of existing debt, the total purchase price to Odyssey Partners was $334 million. Immediately prior and connected with the acquisition, Micom sold its “MICOM Digital” subsidiary for $9.5 million; effectively the Spectrum Digital acquisition made in 1987 for $19.4 million. The $9 million became part of the $51 million of cash of the company. To finance the $334 million, the surviving private company:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;ssued $248 million of Debt&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Issued $34 million of Preferred Stock&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Issued $1 million of Common Stock, and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Used $51 million of Micom’s cash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Micom had $5.8 million of long-term debt on March 31, 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the debt, the strategy was to sell all operations other than the Black Box subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Many management teams might have rested on their laurels after a year like 1987 that NET management reeled in: becoming a public company in January, signing a major agreement with IBM in June and growing sales from $47.4 million for fiscal year ending March 1987 to $90.6 million for 1988. But not the team Bruce Smith and the other founders had assembled. No, they dreamed of NET as one day being a Fortune 500 corporation now in the very early stages of its history. One way was to listen to customers and anticipate their needs. So when Smith, Audrey Maclean and Tony Russo, Vice President of Marketing, who routinely traveled to meet with their customers, sensed that while having acquired ComDesign helped customers building out their data communication networks, a new, maybe even more important, market force required attention: the need to interconnect LANs with their WANs. Having little LAN expertise in-house, and little time to master it, the logical conclusion was to acquire a LAN company. Fortunately, a prime candidate was conveniently headquartered a few miles down the road in San Jose, CA: Excelan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excelan, a public company since February 1987 and growing rapidly, had yet to create the organizational depth needed to tackle the larger opportunity of selling directly to large corporations, organizational resources NET was amassing? That said, Excelan did have the high-performance Ethernet products and TCP/IP protocols NET management heard customers wanting. So when NET management came calling, the conversations proceeded quickly. From Excelan’s perspective, and unknown to NET management at the time, the sudden arrival of NET held the prospect of solving a problem of company leadership the Board was facing. The CEO the Board had hired to facilitate the February IPO, Dick Moore, had lost their confidence and replacing him seemed fraught with risks. So NET arrived like a “white knight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 13, 1987 the companies announced Excelan would merge into NET. When the transaction was completed in July, NET would be giving stock valued at an estimated $119.4 million to the shareholders of Excelan, or about 30% of the value of the combined companies.&lt;a name=&quot;fnlo71&quot; href=&quot;#fn71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt; It was a blockbuster of a merger and left little doubt about what corporations wanted: seamless interconnectivity of their LANs and WANs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the merger was announced, however, the Excelan Board was faced with the crisis they had hoped to avoid. Kanwal Rekhi, then Executive Vice President and Director remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the merger was announced, Moore left, anyhow. And, so I became the CEO again, the second time. The first thing I told the board, if they do that merger, I’m done the day after the merger, because I don’t think this merger made sense. I said every time I looked at them, their way of doing business, it just doesn’t smell right to me. And one of the board members came up to me, and said: ‘If you don’t want the merger we won’t do it.’ So we didn’t do the merger. And the board members were very happy in the end.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 16, NET claimed Excelan was in breach of its obligations under their merger agreement. On June 28, the companies announced the merger was “terminated by mutual consent”. The public documents left unclear what the breach was, only that efforts to renegotiate had failed.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc72&quot; href=&quot;#fn72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the merger proved unsuccessful, it had a lasting impact on both corporations; impacts that would unravel them in both obvious and unsuspecting ways despite both turning in great years for 1988. NET’s sales rose to $136 million, up an impressive 50%. Excelan’s sales rose even more impressively to $65.9 million, up 69%. Clearly the markets for communications products remained robust even as the pressure for market consolidation continued.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

Other leading firms in Data Communications, like Codex, Micom and Network Equipment Technologies either had entered, or were rumored to be interested in entering the local area networking, or Networking, market. It made sense that DCA should as well. In August 1987, DCA acquired the assets of Fox Research, the developer of 10NET for $10 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc74&quot; href=&quot;#fn74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt; Subsequent to the acquisition, DCA renamed Fox Research to: 10NET Communications, Division of DCA. 10NET was a simplistic, resource-sharing network. Even the upgrade to StarLAN in February 1987 made little difference. Eager to sell more than just an entry level LAN, when Ungermann-Bass’s (UBs) stock price tumbled during the October 1987 market crash, DCA quickly made an offer to merge the two firms. Only UB’s Board of Directors had no interest in the “hostile take-over” and rejected DCA’s efforts. Still, as of the end of 1988, DCA had transformed itself through the acquisition of Data Communication (Cohesive Networks) and Networking (Fox Research) products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;racal-electronics-plc-parent-of-racal-data-communications-group-rdcg&quot;&gt;Racal Electronics PLC, parent of Racal Data Communications Group (RDCG)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RDCG had been mostly content remaining a modem company after its acquisition of Milgo and Vadic in 1977. By the mid-1980s, however, RDCG began broadening its product offerings by distributing other companies’ products. But by the end of 1988, RDCG management concluded that if they were going to be in these new businesses, they had better acquire the companies and not just distribute their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeplex-a-subsidiary-of-unisys&quot;&gt;Timeplex (a subsidiary of Unisys)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unisys acquired Timeplex in November 1987 for $307 million. In 1986, the last year Timeplex financial data was available, sales were $119 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;paradyne&quot;&gt;Paradyne&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradyne had long challenged Codex for leadership in the market for high-speed modems. Then management began seeing modems as just an important sub-system of larger systems that could lead to a much larger, and more valuable company. They gallantly bid on a new system for the Social Security Administration and won not the desired sales but unwanted lawsuits. In December 1988, AT&amp;amp;T, playing the “White Knight,” acquired Paradyne for $237 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;stratacom&quot;&gt;Stratacom&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratacom entered this history when Motorola/Codex invested $2.5 million in 1987. For that year Codex purchase $3.2 million as both an end user and distributer, thus accounting for 60% of Stratacom sales.

The last minute break-up of the proposed merger with Convergent Technologies in March 1986, however, left 3Com management uncertain as to the focus of their core strategy: a workgroup or communications company. As Bill Krause, Bob Metcalfe and other key managers met, they supported two goals. Krause remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The primary goal was to create a company that would withstand the test of time, and live beyond its founders. This was our emotional carry-over I had from my HP experience. I really wanted to be part of building something that became an icon in Silicon Valley. Goal two was that I had seen too many of my colleagues overstay their time. It was because it was easy to start companies at a young age and we didn’t have the natural, built-in age barrier that more mature companies had where you became president at 50 and retired at 60, so at the end of 10 years, you’re out of there, and the company got some new, fresh thinking. So I made a commitment that, at the end of ten years, “I’m out of here, and I encourage you guys to do the same thing.” So this all sort of fit in with the fact that there were three of four more years to go before ten years was up for me and we needed to get somebody in place to be our potential successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it possible to imagine both goals being met with either core strategy? The Board of Directors wanted a resolution to the uncertainty and one core focus. When the Board met in January 1987, a decision was reached: to become the second largest communication company. Conceding leadership only to DEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards, Krause remembers a call from Bert Nordin of Digital Communication Associates (DCA):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bert Nordin was chasing everybody. He badly, badly wanted to merge with 3Com. He flew me down to Atlanta and gave a big pitch and argued the merits of merging, and then he took be out of dinner. I explained the situation to Bob, because Bob and Howard were fully aware that I was going down there. So we go to the Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board realized market consolidation was inevitable and encouraged Krause and Metcalfe to analyze the best options for 3Com. They were also decisively against any combination with DCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this time, Krause and Metcalfe had been meeting frequently with Bill Carrico and Judith Estrin of Bridge Communications. Estrin explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We had been talking off and on for years, because first, we did joint development with them, and I knew Bob Metcalfe, and we were located nearby. Then we had a reference sell arrangement with them, and then we OEMed their product. Metcalfe, Krause, Bill and I used to get together for lunch every couple of months, just to talk about the relationship. You know, how was the OEM relationship? How can we do these things? Every once in a while it [a merger for example] came up, and it was never the right time and no one wanted to talk about it. This time, it was kind of the right time for both companies, and I think Krause called Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, Carrico and Estrin had also been assessing how to create an enduring strategy. Carrico remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We were convinced that we had covered the one segment of the marketplace very well, what we call ‘the general purpose LAN segment.’ There was another segment of the LAN market, which we called ‘the system vendor segment,’ which is DEC with its networking equipment. The third piece was ‘PC networking,’ which was really very distinct, because the PC networking was focused on application sharing over the network, where the general purpose was focused much more on communications and connectivity. So the customer said: “Wait a minute. I’ve got these PC networks and I’ve got these general-purpose multi-vendor networks. I don’t want to have to buy this from two vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening and, like exceptional entrepreneurs, acting, Carrico and Estrin had been having serious conversations to combine with Novell, 3Com’s principal competitor. In early 1987, however, the parties terminated conversations. So when Krause called Carrico after 3Com’s January decision, it required little imagination for merger conversations to come up. Carrico opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t think there was any issue in our minds about the strategic benefit. From that perspective, we’d do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasting little time, on July 27, 1987, 3Com and Bridge Communications (Bridge) announced a merger valued at $193 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc75&quot; href=&quot;#fn75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;  When the merger was finalized on September 29, the value of $151 million was significantly lower due to the decline in the market price of 3Com’s stock. Nonetheless, the fiscal four months ending September 30, 1987, 3Com’s sales were $42.3 million and Bridge’s $25.8 million giving, after accounting eliminations, combined sales of $67.9 million and net income of $4.1 million. The financial markets were valuing the “new” 3Com at a little more than two times sales, a far cry from the venture capital multiples enjoyed just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a report on Bridge Communications (Bridge) by Datapro, dated a month earlier, June 1987, the significant investment required to participate in the general-purpose LAN market is mirrored in pages of products. In contrast, a similarly composed list of 3Com’s products would barely fill a single page. Noteworthy, Bridge had introduced four Data Link level bridges, both local and remote. The merging of these two companies had clearly created a leading communications company with an early footprint in the Internetworking market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krause, who retained overall management responsibility as the CEO of 3Com, had seemingly found his successor when Carrico was named President and COO of the combined companies. On a personal level, Krause could easily entertain thoughts of soon leaving 3Com – just as he had imagined. Estrin became one of six general managers reporting to Carrico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalfe assumed the title of the general manager of the Distributed Systems Division – euphemistic for workgroup computing. How was communications to be the focus of the company while investments continued to be made in workgroup computing, the vision of the founder of the company – Metcalfe’s vision?&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc76&quot; href=&quot;#fn76&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;  Krause laments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then we had this moment of uncertainty about whether or not we should be a computer company or a communication company. And I bet on the wrong idea, but the right guy, who was one and the same. Carrico had the right idea, which was become a communication company. Metcalfe wanted to continue being a computing company and continue with the 3Station project. He thought we were on the right track. So I bet on Metcalfe’s strategy, which was the wrong thing to do, but Metcalfe was the right guy, because it turned out that Carrico recognized, and to Bill’s credit he recognized it, that he was an entrepreneur and that he should bail out and go start another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrico remembers the challenge of merging the two companies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What was the big surprise was the culture clash was much more than I ever imagined it would be. I certainly knew that there were culture differences. I knew what I was getting into, but it was just real hard. Also it was hard because Judy and I had gotten very used to running a company more directly, where I was, at Bridge, more involved in the day-to-day activities, and overnight, I was managing through six general managers. It wasn’t as much fun. Judy, on the other hand, went the opposite direction, in that Judy had been second in command at Bridge, and now was just another general manager at 3Com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in May 1988, Carrico and Estrin resigned, to briefly rest, and then to research another fertile market into which to launch another start-up. Krause, on the other hand, again assumed the mantle of President and once again the ponderous and tiring responsibility of resolving the unresolved decision of company focus. He remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Bill left. We didn’t replace Bill. I took Bill’s presidency back, and we formed the divisions, and Eric [Benhamou] moved over to head up the software division, and Bob was heading up the distributed systems division. I had chosen Bob, and Bill had opted out. So we were off to go do our workgroup computing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The superb financial results of 3Com continued with sales for fiscal year ending May 1988 of $252 million, up from $156 million, or up 62 %, and net income of $22.5 million, up from $16.2 million, or up 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all was a walk in the park. The challenges of merging two different sales forces, and the disappointing results of the LAN Manager network operating system were forcing Krause to reconsider the choices that had been made. He reflects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What I underestimated – didn’t recognize – was the conviction of the customer to use industry standard products. That was mistake 1. Mistake 2 was underestimating the capability of our own company. I had concluded that I had made a serious strategic error in trying to become a workgroup computing company, because we really didn’t have the horses to compete with people like IBM and Compaq and Dell and AST and all these other guys. We just didn’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com did have a significant footprint in the Internetworking market, with a market share of 19% of the installed base of bridges and routers, thanks largely to the products inherited from Bridge Communications. However, the indecisiveness over the company strategy, more specifically, the unwillingness to focus on computer communications, did not hold well for its Internetworking future.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The perception, and even understanding, that IP routing represented a new and potentially significant new market was not lost on some engineers and managers within existing firms. An excellent case is that of Ungermann-Bass (UB) where the initiative of John Davidson and others led to an early implementation of a router but the concept was “killed” in the corporate planning process. The example of UB undoubtedly reflects the company’s efforts to reduce its product development and marketing expenses given the difficult financial year management was expecting: in 1986, UB’s Net Income totaled only $18 thousand on sales of $110.9 million. Nevertheless, one choice played a big role in UB’s participation in the Internetworking market. Davidson laments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1986, it became apparent that we could do something with our 68K-based bridging product and software to turn it into a router. And I had my group of people create an IP router in 1986, and not just for purposes of show. I decided “We’re going to go get some business with this router, and then we’re going to bring it to one of these crazy planning meetings we have and I’m going to say: ‘By the way, we’ve already done it.” So we actually got a customer to work with out sales office out of Philadelphia and our technical support people and deploy six boxes, which were standard manufacturing release boxes, at the ends of three different T1 links to connect their six networks together, using these boxes for IP routing. And we built some special management software for them on a PC platform, and did everything the customer asked us to do, and we won that business. We displaced Proteon, we displaced Cisco, and the customer said: “We like this router. We’ll work with you guys. We like working with you, we like the management stuff you’ve got, plus you’ve got all these other things. Dynamite.” I brought that product and that result to a planning meeting in 1986, and maybe representative of our problems at that point; it was rejected flat out as not what the customers wanted. ‘Customers want bridges, not routers,’ and they asked us to stop working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger choice, one demanding an executive decision with serious consequences, was what to do about the INI division and the financial relationship with General Electric. Making the decision even more difficult, INI was Ralph Ungermann, the CEO’s idea. Ungermann recalls the criticism he took for the company’s strategy and reveals an understandable bitterness regarding the failed MAP –GE decision:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s actually a very simple strategy, and it was highly criticized, but every single company that’s not a computer company has adopted it behind us. So, it was highly criticized, but widely accepted. The idea was that if you want to buy a system from IBM, it’s going to be Token Ring. If you want to buy a system from DEC, it’s going to be Ethernet. If you want to buy a system from both of them, it’s going to be Ethernet and Token Ring, ergo, a business opportunity, a niche. A broad product offering is required to support that niche, so you’re not in business unless you’ve got a product line. So everybody said: “Ungermann-Bass is unfocused. They’re doing too many things,” but today, Bridge does Token Ring and broadband and Ethernet, and in fact, mastering those technologies is not very tough. Well, that’s not true. Token Ring investment was an enormous investment, and broadband technology was a big investment, but they’re do-able. They’re engineering feats that, if you’ve got good engineering organizations, you can really do.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that got Ungermann-Bass in trouble was we poured all of our money into that factory networking business unit, and all of our resources into that, and all of a sudden somebody decided that the technology that we were delivering – and we had 70% market share – was going to be made obsolete by a new standard, and that maybe it is our fault for not driving that standard more, but we didn’t, and it happened, and all of a sudden we had an obsolete business unit with a huge portion of our resources going into it, and we had to shift from that. We had to shut that down, meld it back into the organization, and change a lot of people’s careers and direction, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;So it was an enormous dislocation for this company, but we take risks and we missed one. So what? You keep going. We took a gamble on broadband, made a go. We made a gamble on being able to provide an IBM compatible Token Ring, and we’re doing that, and we picked MAP, and we missed. So we picked three out of four, and that hurts, but so what? We’re going to keep going. We’re the only company that can come in today and provide you with a very broad connectivity of IBM and DEC, all based on open standards, and today I think everybody recognizes that’s the only winning strategy for an independent LAN company. So everybody has adopted that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to cut losses and curtail the painful drain on capital forced a restructuring of the relationship with GE. After protracted discussions, in October 1987, UB announced that GE would exchange its 36 percent interest in INI for a 3.6% interest in UB with a four-year option to buy another 3.6% of UB’s stock. INI was soon “melded in,” ending the days of big spending on MAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though 1987 was shaping up to be a good year, certainly much better than it could have been given 1986, there was no way management could have anticipated the market crash of October 1987. With its share price driven down from nearly $12.00 per share to just over $7.00 per share, investors jumped to the conclusion that the company was struggling to remain independent. The ever-opportunistic Digital Communications Associates (DCA) approached the Board in November with an offer to merge the two companies. The merger bid by DCA was $9.75 per share for a total of $175.5 million. When the UB Board displayed little interest, DCA threatened to begin a tender offer to take hostile control of the company.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc77&quot; href=&quot;#fn77&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;  UB responded aggressively saying the transaction was not: “ in the best interest of the company and its shareholders, suppliers and customers.” On November 16, DCA announced that it was dropping its hostile take-over but would hold its roughly one million shares of stock. As word leaked out, the price of UB’s shares dropped $.75 to close at $7.50.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc78&quot; href=&quot;#fn78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While UB had defeated the merger bid of DCA, it left Ungermann shaken. Charlie Bass opines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We just went on the block, and Ralph hires Goldman Sachs and says: “Bring in the best deal. Find out what’s possible.” He, then, starts talking to everybody. He talked to Intel, he talked to HP, he talked to – and that was the best deal. Now, I maintain there didn’t have to be a deal. I mean, this being in play is partly a state of mind, and I think the company did not need to be sold. It was not in trouble. It was simply being hounded. Ralph was tired. Ralph was taking a beating on Wall Street, and he didn’t like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1987, conversations began earnestly with Tandem Computers. For Tandem the decision would be a bold act and for UB the merger felt like finding a safe harbor. Ungermann later explains the reason to merge and opines on the 3Com – Bridge merger:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we’ve had one upstart and two big guys in front of us, but we always knew DEC and IBM were the competition, and now we know for sure, because I am absolutely 100% convinced that 3Com will – that there will be no Bridge division as an effective competitor against us in another two years, because they’re making a decision where they’re going and I knew what that decision is going to be, and it’s going to be over here where they’re successful and where there’s a good market. You see it in the defections of the people, and already we see an enormous difference in their competitiveness out in the field. They’re losing focus and direction in our market, and that’s great. At the same time, we’ve got IBM with more and more capability every day, and so therefore we say: “Oh, geez, we better get to be part of a bigger company, because all these guys are sitting up here saying: ‘Geez, this is a strategic decision, and we only have three strategic vendors, and who’s Ungermann?’” So we said: “We need to be part of a several billion dollar operation,” but we picked a partner who would – who saw things the same way we did. Tandem was a really good partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 22, 1988 Tandem announced its proposal to acquire UB for $260 million, $85.5 million more than the DCA offer.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc79&quot; href=&quot;#fn79&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt; Each UB shareholder would receive $12.50 in cash and the convertible subordinated debenture holders will receive $833.34 per $1,000 of face principal.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc80&quot; href=&quot;#fn80&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davidson shared the views of Bass. He explains there was some rationale:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Certainly a concern on the part of major customers for the financial stability of the company if we were going to make bids on multi-multi million dollar commitments, and they asked questions. There would be those who said we ran ahead too quickly. There will be those who could possibly say ‘Well, there were other problems that were going to come to the company if we didn’t get some financial stability.’ I don’t feel like I’m a good spokesman for those kinds of things. I would have – in fact, when the proposal for a merger came, I voted against it, thinking we’re independent, we’re still making money and we can do some great new products if we would just do ‘em. So it took some convincing before I voted for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, on March 18, Tandem Computers announced the successful conclusion of its tender offer with 95% of the outstanding shares tendered. The acquisition was formally completed on June 30, 1988. Jim Jordan, no longer with the company, but still knowledgeable about the market explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t know about the price, or if they paid too much or anything else, but strategic-wise, if they can absorb it and manage it, it probably makes an awful lot of sense for Tandem. Their main competitor has got to be DEC, and DEC’s more of a networking company than anybody else around right now. DEC’s the biggest competitor Ungermann-Bass has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1988, Ungermann, now a Vice-President and Director of Tandem, reflects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I believe you can’t survive without being a strategic vendor, and Tandem has become one of those. It’s only $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion this year, but on the other hand, they are a strategic supplier to a huge number of big companies, and already it’s impacted our business very substantially and significantly, in terms of our opportunity to go in and deal with companies we’d never even think of getting into as a strategic communications supplier. So we’re finding ourselves in more and more situations where IBM and Tandem are the computer company and we’re the networking company. AT&amp;amp;T is the long-haul networking company. So I think it is as necessary part of this evolution, because my view is this information stuff is so critical, you’re out of business without controlling it, and therefore every company is going to focus on it. What we want to do is pick off the leaders in those companies and make sure they implement it right, and then the others will follow. I guarantee you nobody’s going to select a little company to be their strategic communications supplier. So are we big enough? Two billion. Well, we’ve got to grow fast, but Tandem has the reputation and the ability to deliver complex, strategic on-line systems, and therefore, we’ve been able to bid on and win some deals that we just would have not been able to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of UB as an independent Networking company demonstrates how making just one strategic investment mistake can be the end of independence.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In 1981, Proteon was one of the start-ups contributing to the Emergent phase of Networking. (See Chapter 8.4 Proteon) In June 1981, Proteon shipped its initial product: the ProNET-10, a 10 megabit token passing LAN. Since most experts expected IBM to introduce token-passing LANs as well, until they made their products clearly known, the market uncertainty hovering over token passing made life very difficult for Proteon. Finally, on October 15, 1985, IBM announced a 4M bps token passing LAN – not one of the alternative technologies, especially Ethernet. Nevertheless, during those intervening years the “Ethernet” companies had gained market advantage and scale. Understanding these dynamics are essential to understanding why and how Proteon entered the Internetworking Market in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important as well to this story is the close relationship Proteon enjoyed with MIT’s Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). Proteon developed the ProNET-10 under contract from the LCS and funded by DARPA. DARPA was keen to understand whether the deterministic performance of token ring was superior to that of the stochastic Ethernet. At the same time, DEC had gifted a large number of VAX computers to LCS to be networked together. MIT chose to use Proteon’s token ring LAN(s) as the backbones. Unfortunately for Proteon, DEC elected to sell Ethernet, not token passing, LANs to its commercial customers. That same year, Mike Dertouzos, director of LCS, and friend of Proteon’s founder Howard Salwen, introduced Salwen to Noel Chiappa, a research scientist with LCS. Chiappa becomes important in the history of multi-protocol gateways/routers. The bond between Proteon and LCS was further reinforced that year when Prof. David Clark of LCS – and TCP/IP fame - joined Proteon’s Board of Directors, undoubtedly with the blessings of Dertouzos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking up the story in 1983, it was the period during which Proteon was struggling to generate the cash it needed through operations. While raising money from venture capitalists seemed possible, Salwen was unwilling to cede management control to those he viewed as more interested in “flipping” his company – preferring a quick return rather than building a “real” company - that was until he met Jon Bayless, a partner of the venture capital firm Sevin Rosen Bayless Borovoy. Bayless had begun calling on the company in early 1983. Even then Salwen politely shunned Bayless’s overtures; that was until a project undertaken in August threatened the company’s existence. Salwen remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People were interested in our technology, but had no way to use it. We could do Multibus and Unibus and Q-bus, and that was it, but they liked the idea of the token passing ring. A fellow from National Advanced Systems, Larry Corey, insisted that we do a PC card and do it now. I had no money; I mean I was strangulating for lack of funds. You have to understand this, and yet we committed to him to do a PC card, which led to P-1300. We started in August and we delivered in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the serendipitous: Novell, the leading LAN operating system company, contacted Proteon. Salwen remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They wanted their software to run on everything that ran, and when they tried our PC adapter card, that they were able to do in mid-November of ‘83, they were really impressed with the speed. They had tested nothing like it. I mean it just flew. And so, they gave us part of their booth at the November ‘83 Comdex tradeshow. Ray Noorda, President of Novell, helped us tremendously by bringing people over to the booth. I can remember John Doerr, of the preeminent venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers, standing there talking to me, and Ray Noorda, again and again, with his arm around somebody, saying: “Now, I’d like to show you something really special.” And Doerr is watching what’s going on and had a real appreciation for what we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December 1983, the stress of juggling insufficient cash between payroll and accounts payable, and never having enough to invest in market opportunities finally coming their way, Salwen accepted the inevitable. He agreed to terms and raised $2.4 million of Convertible Preferred Stock Series A. In doing so, he ceded management to the investors and agreed to increase the burn rate by hiring a management team. (Investors were led by two of the most coveted partnerships: Sevin Rosen Bayless Borovoy and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers.) Salwen afterwards devoted himself to engineering, LAN standards activities and Board responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search for a new President and VP of Finance began immediately: a temporary President was installed. While the investors had confidence in token ring, they needed a strategy until IBM made its intentions known. Core to defining their strategy was agreeing to a product development plan. Proteon’s plan, of course, required making a best guess as to when IBM would make known their LAN strategy. The most valuable input to that decision was the pace IBM was forcing within IEEE 802 to finalize a token ring LAN standard. After considerable discussion, the best guess was 1985 at the earliest. Given that the token ring market was not going to take off before IBM’s endorsement, then either the market continued to lumber until 1986 or other technologies would be adopted by customers – a sobering outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three product development strategies emerged: continue to improve the ProNET-10 product line and prepare for IBM’s presumed token ring choice; introduce a high-speed token-ring backbone LAN, a product essential to their university and campus customers; and develop products that made interconnection with other LAN technologies more effective and efficient. During 1984, Proteon’s product announcements reflected primarily incremental innovations to the ProNET-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also that year, the personal relationship between Salwen and Mike Dertouzos, the DIrector of MIT’s LCS bore unexpected fruit. Upon returning from sabbatical, Noel Chiappa a LCS research scientist, shared an insight for a multi-protocol gateway dreamed on warm sand beaches, with Dertouzos. Dertouzos authorized Chiappa to begin work on the code for what would become known as the “MIT C gateway” and introduced Chiappa to Salwen – for the charter of the LCS did not include building, much less marketing, products.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc81&quot; href=&quot;#fn81&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;  Chiappa was soon working for both organizations. At MIT, before the end of the year, Chiappa’s vision led to Internetworking router software running in all of the DEC MicroVAX IIs linking Ethernet to the token-ring backbone.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc82&quot; href=&quot;#fn82&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1985, Proteon introduced their second product, their backbone LAN: the ProNET-80, “the first commercially available local area network to operate at speeds up to 80M bps.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc83&quot; href=&quot;#fn83&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;  With this product, Proteon distanced itself from the other would-be token ring competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, on October 15, 1985, IBM announced its Token-Ring Network.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc84&quot; href=&quot;#fn84&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;  As expected, the Token-Ring Network conformed to the IEEE 802.5 LAN standards. What was slightly surprising was its maximum 4M bps speed, or data rate, given the 10M bps speed of existing Ethernet LANs and of competitor token ring LANs. IBM also left unclear how the earlier announced IBM PC Network (the Sytek product) and the Token-Ring Network would coexist. Everyone assumed the Sytek product would be quickly phased out, but IBM would not make its intentions known. While other vendors took weeks to respond, Proteon announced its ProNET-4 the same day as IBM made its announcement. The ProNET-4 came with not only the IBM PC interface but also Q-bus. Multibus, VMEbus and IBM-compatible microcomputer interfaces. No matter what one thought of the IBM announcement, all agreed a giant dark cloud had been lifted and there should be no more excuses for why the token passing LAN market did not take off. And it would!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that same day, Proteon established early leadership in the emerging Internetworking market with the introduction of the p4200 LAN gateway. The p4200 could interconnect its new ProNET-4, and its ProNET-10 and -80 networks as well as Ethernet LANs and public WANs.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc85&quot; href=&quot;#fn85&quot;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;  The ProNET-Linkway software for the p4200 was derived from Chiappa’s vision and the working MIT C code. The p4200 is considered the first commercially available multi-protocol router. (The use of the term router came only over time; finally taking hold in 1987. The p4200 was known first as a LAN gateway then a Gateway router and finally Router) Proteon further broadened its product line with new passive ProNET Wire Centers that supported a wide range of media connections including shielded twisted pair, coaxial cable, and optical fiber. A diagram published in DataPro in September 1986 is an example of Proteon’s product offerings. (Exhibit 12.14 ProNet LAN Configurations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-14181-pronet-lan-configurations&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.18.1 ProNET LAN Configurations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_14.18.1_proteon_pronet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Proteon ProNET LAN Configurations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1985, the arduous search for a new President came to a close. Francis Sciricco, a young, fast track General Electric executive, then managing a consumer appliance division in Kentucky, made the leap to the still promising, but struggling technology company. The desperate need for a President had out weighted his lack of technology experience, and thus judgment. He faced the daunting tasks of bringing executive order to the systems and structure of a company no longer a start-up but too often acting as such, as well as the urgent need to refine the development and marketing strategies to fit markets and technologies in the throes of great change. The chaos within the “corner office” hardly had time to settle when a disastrous fourth quarter precipitated change throughout the management ranks, including the resignation of Sciricco in early 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.J. Sevin, lead investor and Board Member, assumed the thankless role of Acting President. No one knew better than he that the company’s future rested on the completion of a timely search, and this time, on successfully finding a fully qualified technology executive. Within days of settling into the flow of operational decision-making, the highly regarded Sevin concluded the same as had management: the Networking market was best described as tumultuous. It was if the competition had been secretly preparing during the years before the IBM announcement, and now that IBM had announced what could be disparagingly described as unimpressive products, competition unleashed a barrage if products to gain market share before IBM had time to exercise its market power. Customers too seemed more willing to get on with building out their networks, no longer fearing that IBM might either introduce a radically superior technology or release undeniable proof that LANs were some great fraud. The Ethernet companies, with the compelling advantage of multiple chip suppliers and strong balance sheets from recent IPOs (Ungermann-Bass, 3Com, Bridge Communications) or mergers into larger competitors (3Com merger with Bridge Communications, Tandem Computers acquisition of UB, Interlan into Micom or Fox Associates into Digital Communications Associates), were the most aggressive in threatening market order with price cuts. No, Acting was a role L.J. wanted to shed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remaining competitive required product upgrades and new products. In February 1987, Proteon announced its p4210 gateway interface.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc86&quot; href=&quot;#fn86&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt;  Specifically designed to work with the p4200, the p4210 enabled its various token ring networks as well as those of IBM, including those of competitors like 3Com and Ungermann-Bass – any products conforming to the 802.5 standard—to communicate with, and route over, Ethernet networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1987, Proteon announced a series of new enhancements for its Pro-NET-4 network to make the network compatible with: IBM’s PC LAN Program, Advanced Program-to-Program Communications PC, Network Basic I/O System and the 3270 Emulation Program Version 3.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc87&quot; href=&quot;#fn87&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;  Then in July, they announced more enhancements necessitated by competing with IBM, this time for its ProNET-10 networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc88&quot; href=&quot;#fn88&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;  To match the price reductions of Ethernet competitors, Proteon also announced a 30% price reduction for its ProNET-10 adapters. Competition and lower sales prices were impacting revenues and margins, and higher operating costs depressed earnings. It was obvious to Sevin that more cash was needed both to protect the balance sheet as well as attract a candidate for President. At the August Board meeting, Sevin reported the search had uncovered no qualified candidates, and that the company’s distribution strategy needed to include many more value-added resellers (VARs). At the October meeting, the Board dealt largely with the yet-to-close financing. After a lengthy discussion of pricing, it seemed fair to price the round down by 30% from the last round – but not nearly as deep a “haircut” as some new investors wanted. Proteon had clearly lost its patina and was now seen more as a turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November came the good news (the “financeable event”) the Board and existing investors had been waiting for: Patrick Courtin was named President, Chief Executive and member of the Board. He had the technology know how long sought, including ten years of experience with DEC. While his coming aboard had little impact on the financial results for 1987, he did facilitate closing the financing of $2.4 million, raising the total venture capital investment to $17.4 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc89&quot; href=&quot;#fn89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;  In December, he announced the projections for 1988: sales of $37 million and net income of $1.2 million; projections that helped in the closing the Preferred D round of financing. A month later the results for 1987 were made known: sales of $22.3 million, up 15% over 1986, with a loss of $5.7 million (a loss equal to one third of the venture capitalists’ total investment). Hopefully the yearend actions and decisions would contribute to a successful 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Interface Trade Show in March 1988, Proteon introduced its second-generation p4200 gateway. Faster and more reliable, the new p4200 supported TCP/IP, DECnet and XNS, no longer was it just hardware interfaces but communication protocols as well. In an interview in May, Courtin said sales for 1988 were doing great, helped by the recently announced p4200. In fact, the sales of gateways and high-speed products, i.e. ProNET-80, accounted for 40% of Proteon’s sales.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc90&quot; href=&quot;#fn90&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Board meeting in June, Courtin indicated sales for 1988 might total $40 million and then soar to $75 million in 1989. The sales breakdown for 1989 was estimated to be $50 million of adapters, $20 million of routers, i.e. gateways, and $5 million of high-speed products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1988, Proteon introduced a new router for smaller networks: it didn’t have a T-1 connection, but rather slower 64Kbps connections. Reflecting the demand for solutions, and a more complete product for it is corporate friend, Novell, the p4100 employed a TCP/IP backbone which connected to IPX(N), the Novell interface and communication protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteon had a successful 1988. Sales of $40.6 million, up 82%, and income from operations of $1.1 million. Cash totaled $1.6 million. Proteon was second only to IBM in the market for token-ring adapters and a perceived leader in the fast-growing Internetworking market. If Proteon qualified as a turnaround, it might be said “so far so good.”&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;In August 1986, Concord Data Systems (CDS) executives and investors came to the painful, yet only option left to save the company, and signed stacks of legal documents dividing CDS into two companies; one to focus on dial-up modems and one on MAP/token bus. The profits from dial-up modems, the fortunes of which had suddenly declined, could no longer fund the unremitting investment required by MAP/token bus. The simple fact was continuing to fund MAP/token bus seemed certain to bankrupt CDS. The charter of the new company, Concord Communications, Inc. (CCI), was the capital draining MAP/token bus business. Simultaneous with the reorganization, CCI closed a $9 million financing, $7 million of which was new money, with a post-money valuation of $22 million. Investors chose to ignore sluggish MAP revenues, focusing instead on the aggressive promotion of MAP by General Motors (GM) and the success of the Autofact ’85 Show, that had painted a promising future for MAP and factory automation. The hollow factory fears of the early 1980’s had an answer in the technological prowess of American ingenuity and investors wanted part of it. The management of CCI was now free to weave an exciting story beginning with the pioneering innovation of token bus, leading to its adoption as the LAN technology of manufacturing giants like GM, and selected as the LAN for MAP/OSI. It was a story no longer weakened by excuses for being in the boring business of dial-up modems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Ken Miller, the founder of CDS, remembers the fortunate timing of the 1986 reorganization:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean, CCI got the money at the right time, boy. It was right after that, that MAP stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The softening sales of MAP/token bus quickly tested the optimism of the new CCI management team. Exhibiting a sense of survival unpracticed by prior management, Tony Helies, the new CEO of CCI, launched an immediate effort to cut costs. Since costs for a start-up are principally for personnel, Helies had little choice but to reduce headcount. By early 1987, CCI was down to 55 employees, a staff reduction of roughly 30% in six months. Now the challenge was to reclaim the perception of market leader from INI, the joint venture of Ungermann-Bass and General Electric, that itself was reorganizing. The ideal opportunity was to stage a high profile presentation at the publicized Enterprise Networking Event (ENE) scheduled for June 1988. To do so meant mastering the MAP communication protocols of the Network and Transport Layers, something that had eluded them in the past. Miller, opining in no uncertain terms on the challenge in February 1988, remarked: “There’s a lot of protocol shit.” Being late had its advantages, however, for the communications standards for MAP were final: they would not be coding software to changing specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCI could hardly have envisioned a more successful ENE. In addition to hosting an Exhibitor’s Booth, they played prominent roles in three of the eight Sponsor Booths, those of General Motors, Deere &amp;amp; Co. and Process Industries. Prominent in use was their Series 4200 Broadband to Carrierband Bridge that allowed transparent connections between the 802.4/10 Mbps Broadband and the 802.4/5 Mbps Carrierband – all token bus. The Series 4200 extended the useful life of CCI’s slower 5 Mbps technology and demonstrated its mastery of both the higher speed 10 Mbps technology and the OSI communication software. The success made all the pressure they had endured from GM for the past year somehow bearable. They had reclaimed the mantel of technology leader through their own hard work as well as the unexpected disappearance of INI/UB. The days of big spending by INI had ended with its merger back into UB beginning in October 1987, their act to solve their cash hemorrhaging, and further minimized by the pending and then final purchase of UB by Tandem Computers in February, a few months before ENE. Tandem Computers acquired UB for $260 million and MAP/token bus was hardly a focus of attention. Miller remembers, in his own blunt and terse form of expression:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The good news is INI is falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a joyous management team returning from ENE, the prospect of achieving the coming year’s ambitious financial plan of $10 million of revenue and profitability, seemed much more realistic than before ENE. Their new expertise with the MAP communication protocols was generating new sales opportunities as well, especially with DEC. But no sooner had the attendees settled into their accustomed routines then the luncheon and closed door conversations turned to the question: Did they really believe the MAP/token bus market was going to take off? Helies responded by forming task groups to explore what were their best strategic choices leading to a reliable and prosperous future. In the fall of 1988, a team ventured to the West Coast and the TCP/IP Interop conference. So even as they were committed to achieving a revenue plan of $10 million and, all the while, professing belief in MAP/token bus, they had concluded internally that their future laid elsewhere, not with MAP/token bus.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/14.20/DEC,-Excelan,-Sytek,-and-CMC/",

In 1965, the economics of computer communications were essential controlled by AT&amp;amp;T, IBM, the FCC and the body politic. One entrepreneurial start-up of the time was without peer: Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Kenneth Olsen and Harlan Anderson founded DEC in 1957, with venture capital from American Research &amp;amp; Development calculated using a post-money valuation of $100,000. DEC launched and led the minicomputer market for many years. In 1979, Robert Metcalfe, the father of Ethernet, called on Gordon Bell of DEC to gain DEC’s support to work with Xerox and Intel to lobby for Ethernet to become a LAN standard. By 1986, a year representing the emergence of Internetworking, DEC was the leading LAN vendor controlling 20% of the market for LAN adapters and 35% of Ethernet adapter shipments. No corporation had more incentive to innovate products to interconnect LANs than did DEC and, in 1984, DEC launched the first successful Ethernet bridge, the LAN Bridge 100. To provide a remote bridge, DEC partnered with Vitalink (See Vitalink) resulting in the TransLAN products. In July 1985, DEC entered the gateway market with its External Document Exchange gateway providing services between DEC’s All-In-1 environments and IBM’s DISOSS nodes. Finally, DEC entered the router market with a series of products (TransPath) partnered with Vitalink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;excelan&quot;&gt;Excelan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the announced merger between Excelan and NET collapsed on June 28, 1987, other companies interested in Excelan probably saw Excelan as a company “in play.” But not Kanwal Rekhi, who became President immediately after the failed merger. He preferred to focus on building a significant company than making money through “financial engineering.” The revenue results for the two years ending December 1987 and 1988 – $39 million and $66 million – certainly justified his assessment and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sytek&quot;&gt;Sytek&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The token ring announcement by IBM on October 15, 1985 changed the fate of Sytek. It was not until the second quarter of 1988 that they again attained profitability. The question still remained if they could survive as an independent company?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication-machinery-corporation-cmc&quot;&gt;Communication Machinery Corporation (CMC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 1988, Rockwell International bought CMC for an estimated $40 million and renamed it Rockwell Network Systems.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/14.21/cisco-Systems/",

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Leonard Bosack and his wife, Sandy Lerner, started cisco Systems for very different reasons than those motivating Paul Severino and his team. They didn’t have to spend years finding the seed of a great idea, one around which to create a fast-growing company to take public and holding the potential to support a large, successful enterprise. No, they had little calling to become entrepreneurs or earn entrepreneurial profits. In fact, if anything, they were happy academics willing to give what they had or knew away, resistant to even marking-up their production costs to make a profit. So when Stanford University said they could not build product on university property and sell it to commercial companies, they felt they had little choice and left Stanford and started a journey that most entrepreneurs can only dream of and few ever have the opportunity to realize: a company worth hundreds of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosack and Lerner met in 1977 while sharing time on Stanford University’s minicomputers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc91&quot; href=&quot;#fn91&quot;&gt;91&lt;/a&gt; Lerner was a graduate student and Bosack fit the description of a “computer nerd.” They fell in love, married, and took jobs with the Business School’s and Computer Science computer departments, respectively. As such, they became involved in a number of efforts by Stanford to create a unified campus network. Stanford had thousands of different computers and users wanted to share information across the computers as if there was really only one integrated system. To do so, the computers, with their different operating systems and communication protocols, had to be able to easily inter-exchange information. After a number of failed efforts, by June 1980, Bill Yeager, an engineer with the Medical School, had created a working router.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc92&quot; href=&quot;#fn92&quot;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;  Even so, it still did not connect to the Ethernet network that was integral to the Stanford University Network (SUN). Frustrated, in 1982, Bosack, Lerner and other engineers worked without authorization to create both an interface between Yeager’s router and Ethernet and then to pull the coaxial cable needed to connect the computers throughout the campus. Yeager joined their efforts as did other engineers and before long their “skunk works” project was a success. To build additional routers, Bosack and Lerner converted their living room into an assembly room. Routers were then tested on the SUN network and the IMP’s that connected to the Arpanet. Word of the routers spread both within Stanford and through the crude email of the day to other research centers and universities. Swamped with orders and needing a way to satisfy demand, other than by using their living room and credit cards, they approached Stanford and the Office of Technology Licensing (OTL). Only OTL could not offer a solution that would take less than years. Again frustrated, they left Stanford to start a business that would become cisco Systems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc93&quot; href=&quot;#fn93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 10, 1984, Bosack and Lerner incorporated cisco Systems. Little changed other than that they could now take orders from any organization. As the order flow increased, the living room got more and more crowded and the need for cash more pressing. In the roughly eight months to July 31, 1985, sales totaled $109 thousand. The lack of cash and, therefore, the need for investment capital to grow an organization and develop the market forced Bosack and Lerner to mortgage their home to the max, borrow as much as they could on their credit cards and from friends. Strapped for cash to pay their bills, Lerner took a daytime job managing the research computing systems for Schlumberger Computer Aided Systems Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constraint of cash had two other effects on the early history of cisco Systems. First, unable to invest in a direct sales organization, the company had to resort to using manufacturer’s representatives who were only paid when sales were made. This limited sales to customers that did not need a lot of technical support, organizations such as universities, research laboratories and government agencies, especially the government. These early adopters were also the easiest to reach through their Stanford connections and email networks. The second effect was the liberal use of part-time and contract engineers to develop products, primarily software products that executed on a small number of generic hardware platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues for the twelve months ending July 31, 1986 were essentially flat year over year: $129 thousand. Bosack and Lerner realized that if they wanted to be successful, they need capital and professional help. So they, like so many entrepreneurs before them, began the search for venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding venture capital proved a lot more challenging than Bosack and Lerner had imagined it would be. Bosack recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We must have talked to 80 to 90 different venture firms. We got turned down by just about every one.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc94&quot; href=&quot;#fn94&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It quickly became apparent that without serious management, the probability of raising capital at an acceptable valuation was remote. So in January 1987, they hired a President and Chief Executive Officer, William Graves, and then a vice-president, finance in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately one of the venture capital firms they did talk to was Sequoia Capital, one of the most successful and largest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. A dominant firm, Sequoia Capital had the resources not just to evaluate investment projects they received or discovered, but to do the research and thinking required to become strategic investor – to look for investments they wanted to make. When they listened to Bosack and Lerner, the partners of Sequoia heard not a company needing capital but a raw start-up needing everything, everything that is other than an intriguing jump on a product idea they had identified in their partners’ meetings as compelling. Bosack and Lerner felt mentally stripped but not rejected: they realized the partners, and especially the managing partner, Don Valentine, weren’t questioning the product viability, only their ability to build a company fast enough to compete with much larger, entrenched competition. They left agreeing to provide the information, and time, so that Sequoia Capital’s partners could do their due diligence. They also knew that if they got an offer from Sequoia Capital, they would take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that sales for fiscal year ending July 31, 1987 were $1.5 million, with nearly a 10% net income before taxes, kept cash usage to a minimum and enabled the company to continue to grow modestly while they sought venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valentine soon proposed that Sequoia Capital invest $2.5 million for 32 percent of the company. Bosack and Lerner would retain 30 percent of the company, ownership that would vest over four years. Valentine would become a member of the Board of Directors and, much to the relief of the founders who recognized that they had no interest in the management aspects of the company, would assume responsibility for finance, and help Graves build a management team, sales organization and “operations process.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc95&quot; href=&quot;#fn95&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;  Bosack became chief technology officer and Lerner vice-president of customer services. The financing closed in December 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1988, during an interview for an article to be published in Electronics magazine, Graves made a number of telling comments.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc96&quot; href=&quot;#fn96&quot;&gt;96&lt;/a&gt;  First he referred to cisco System’s products gateways, not routers, and terminal servers. Second, he stated that their gateway technology could “ handle networks as large as 100,000 subnets in an integrated WAN comprised of multi-media, multi-protocol and multi-vendor subsystems. At this time his claims were largely marketing hyperbole, but in the future Cisco and others would make the products to prove his claims prophetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Valentine, and a fellow senior partner, Pierre Lamond, began devoting the kind of time to cisco Systems that few companies receive. It became obvious to them that a stronger management team was needed and, in May 1988, President Graves, was replaced with an interim President until an executive search could identify a candidate acceptable to Sequoia Capital. (See Exhibit 12.15 1989 Router Vendors)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the $2.5 million investment cisco Systems raised proved to be sufficient as eager customers placed orders on attractive terms and the lack of competition allowed the company to essentially build product once orders were received. The combination kept the growth in working capital (accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) to a minimum. Thus, cisco grew by more than a factor of three for the fiscal year ending July 1988 without having to sell more stock. The sales for fiscal year 1988 totaled $5.5 million with net income before taxes and interest of $555 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1988, John Morgridge became the new President and CEO. He would prove to be a superb hire as was management team soon recruited. In December 1988, Valentine became Chairman of the Board of Directors. All was going as hoped and planned other than growing contention with the founders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cisco Systems was a small organization compared to those Morgridge had managed, his due diligence had accurately revealed that the company’s products were superb, maybe the best currently available and, given the market prospects, he truly joined a large company while it was still small. Even so, he could not have hoped for the outcomes awaiting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-14211--1989-router-vendors&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.21.1  1989 Router Vendors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_14.21.1_router_vendors_1989.png&quot; alt=&quot;table of 1989 Router Vendors&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;After Micom acquired Interlan on March 1, 1985, Paul Severino, the then President of Interlan and key founder, became Vice-President, Product Planning and Technology for Micom. Moving to a staff position made sense but was not without its own risks. Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had been trying for a few years to get out of day to day operations and become more of a strategy technology-oriented person, but still with my eye on getting the next generation of products out the door. So the deal that was cut with Micom was that I would become a Micom VP and I would be looking at this whole corporate strategy thing, which I did for the first four or five months. But the problem was that the Interlan side was just being kept closed, even to me, and I wanted ‑‑ I knew that Micom had to make some leaps in order to really compete again, and I wanted to take off a group and just go build the next generation of product, and Roger and I just couldn’t come to an agreement that that was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to reach an agreement with Roger Evans, the CEO of Micom, and tired of the cross country travel from his home outside Boston to and from Micom’s headquarters just north of Los Angeles, Severino resigned in September 1985. He harbored no fear of being unemployed, only excitement about starting another company. His entrepreneurial nature had free reign once again to shape his future. He fondly recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I left, in September of 1985, I actually started working on a project to build a company that was going to be doing factory automation systems. I was going to go back to my Data Acquisition days, but I was going to do it with MAP. But I wasn’t going to be a networking company. I wanted to be a computing company. I wanted to provide the workstation of the factory that was networked like an Apollo system. I wanted to do this real time cell ‑‑ they call it cell controllers ‑‑ real time cell controller, UNIX real time, with integrated MAP networking and literally using the MAP network as a mechanism by which you could have real time networked operation over the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November at the Autofact Trade Show, Severino saw Ralph Ungermann, CEO of Ungermann-Bass. He remembers a snippet of their conversation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ralph says: ‘What are you doing here.’ I said: ‘Well, I’m looking at factories.’ He said: ‘You’re not going to go be an industrial networking company are you?’ I said: ‘No, no I’m looking at the computer side of the business,’ which I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severino and his team continued their investigation until they realized:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We looked at that for six months, there was about four of us. The problem we found? First of all, factory users don’t buy from new companies. Secondly, there isn’t an application in the factory that drives a network like there is in CAD, like there is in the engineering environment, like there is in just a distributed data processing environment. There isn’t an application. The only application that we found that drove a network into GM was literally downloading programmable logic into numerical controllers with programs instead of ROMs. That was the only application that we found, and clearly that’s not a fancy application, so we just made the decision, even though we had a plan and we had figured out what the products should be, we just said: “This is crazy. This is not going to be where you grow in the networking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On seeing Ungermann at an Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons conference in March, 1986, Severino shared his conclusion to an unconvinced Ungermann. Again:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He said: ‘Did you start that company?’ I said: ‘No, I didn’t.’ He said: ‘Why not?’ I said: ‘I can’t find an application that’s going to drive networks in a factory.’ He said: ‘No, it’s there. We got it. We got all the OEMs lined up. It’s all happening.’ I said: ‘Ralph, I’m telling you, I just can’t put my finger on what’s going to drive users to install networks in a factory. It isn’t flexible manufacturing. It isn’t this concept of time cards all over the factory. I don’t see it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not discouraged in the least, he and his team began looking elsewhere. Severino then recalled learning about T-1 at Micom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I became aware of T1 when I was poking around for Micom looking at different kinds of companies. In fact, the first time I actually became aware of T1 was when I actually went down to visit Avanti. Now it became clear to me that T1 was important and that, if you believe the way I do, that LAN traffic is going to dominate what happens in computing and computers, then computer systems are going to be connected with LANs from now on until I can see. As soon as you understand that then the next step is, the world still needs to be interconnected. Companies still have remote sites and they still want to get at the classical datacom problem, therefore you need different kinds of devices than modems and multiplexers. You need routers and bridges. You need things that work differently, and if you mate those up with the technology of T1, you ought to be able to access a group of customers and have that problem and make a business out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1986, Severino and four former employees of Interlan, William Seifert, Steve Willis, David Rowe and Jennifer Lamonakis, incorporated Wellfleet Communications, Inc. The mission: to develop, manufacture, market and support a family of high-performance, multi-protocol internetworking products. Next came the task of raising the money needed to adequately finance the more encompassing vision to create a systems supplier not just a product-oriented company, as had been the case with Interlan. Severino naturally turned to his friend and business partner, Russell Plantizer of J.H. Whitney, his lead investor at Interlan, to play that role again. Plantizer agreed. They immediately approached Ed Anderson, a former investor in Interlan and associated with Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons. On the strength of his experiences with Severino, and having made money as well on the Interlan investment, agreed to participate. They both joined the Board of Directors, and before the end of fiscal year ending June 1987, had raised nearly $6 million with J.H.Whitney investing $3 million. In July 1987, Art Carr, now President and CEO of Bytex and formerly CEO of Codex, also joined the Board of Directors. Severino remembers the distinction between Interlan and Wellfleet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the Interlan approach I had my eyes focused on a particular segment and I didn’t care whether I was the number one company or number two company. All I wanted to make was a profitable business. But now we raised a lot more money, and our product is going after a segment which we think is going to be a very important segment, and we’re going after it with a product that’s very fully functioned as we come out the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build an Internetworking company also required recruiting an engineering team with a diverse set of experiences, just as Bruce Smith had done at Network Equipment Technologies. In Severino’s words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you look at the people that are in Wellfleet today, the engineering people, we have people that are out of BBN, we have people that are out of AT&amp;amp;T, we have people that are out of the computer companies that are doing LANs: a wide spectrum of people with different kinds of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge now became getting product to market as soon as possible. In deciding which elements of their product were most important to introduce first, they had to assess who they thought their competition would be. Severino remembers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I believed that Vitalink would probably be the biggest threat.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc97&quot; href=&quot;#fn97&quot;&gt;97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severino would be surprised to encounter another start-up: cisco Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product development began in earnest in mid-1987. Indicative of the productivity that is so often evident in start-ups, Wellfleet Communications shipped the first of what will be three major products able to bridge or route LANs and WANs in April 1988. The Link Node, or LN, could support an aggregate of 16 connections (eight of which need be LANs). In June 1988, the Concentrator Node, or CN, was released and able to support an aggregate of 52 connections. Then in May 1989, the Feeder Node, or FN, was released and supported an aggregate of 4 connections. These three products plus an UNIX-based software package that provided network management tools, could be configured in systems to support thousands of connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the CN was released, Wellfleet Communications encountered performance problems with both its LN and CN products that delayed shipment schedules until late 1988.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc98&quot; href=&quot;#fn98&quot;&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;  Brad Baldwin, an analyst with the market research firm Dataquest, reported “the delays caused Wellfleet to virtually concede the T-1 side of its business to Vitalink and cisco Systems.”&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc99&quot; href=&quot;#fn99&quot;&gt;99&lt;/a&gt; Fortunately the company had raised nearly $4 million in a third round of private financing that had been intended to finance the company’s growth and would now be largely consumed by the delays in revenues. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, Wellfleet Communications reported revenue of $320 thousand with a net loss of $4.1 million. Ending cash was $3.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Most corporations fail; investors suffering a loss of all or most of their investments. Yet there are a few lucky corporations that are able to overcome the odds and discover a path that leads to success. The story of Vitalink is one of management willing to face the failure of their founding strategy and steer their company into the strong currents of a growth market before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the founders incorporated Vitalink in 1980, they had an initial strategy to build private, corporate satellite data communications systems.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc100&quot; href=&quot;#fn100&quot;&gt;100&lt;/a&gt;  By 1984, what was once a promising opportunity had turned into a capital-intensive, fiercely, competitive market. Seeking out a new niche to leverage their competences and past investments, Vitalink teamed up with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to solve mutual, yet distinctly different, problems. At the time, DEC sought a solution for interconnecting multiple Ethernet LANs primarily within a building. Given their experience interconnecting different kinds of networks, it was natural for Vitalink to bring to the collaboration ideas for interconnecting multiple, disparate Ethernets. A result of their cooperation was the creation of the first remote bridge, to be sold as Vitalink’s TransLAN. (See Exhibit 12.16 Vitalink’s TransLAN) The TransLAN interconnected one Ethernet LAN to as many as eight long-haul networks, via either terrestrial or satellite links. Vitalink and DEC next signed expanded co-development and co-marketing agreements. Vitalink would benefit by selling its TransLAN to potential customers generated from DEC’s marketing systems. (Surprisingly however, Vitalink OEM’d the TransLAN Ethernet hardware from Bridge Communications, not DEC.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc101&quot; href=&quot;#fn101&quot;&gt;101&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-1986, financial constraints forced Vitalink management into uncharted strategic territory. Intense competition in the private satellite business had made it difficult to grow revenue or attain profitability. Challenged, management took two actions. First, they decided to narrow their satellite strategy to the new Vsat technologies and cease building private networks requiring special programing and development. Informing their decision was the fact that 80% to 90% of TransLAN products ran over terrestrial lines,&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc102&quot; href=&quot;#fn102&quot;&gt;102&lt;/a&gt; and since it was TransLAN that was growing revenues, refocusing the satellite business to support TransLAN. The more modest Vsat strategy still leveraged past satellite investments while, hopefully, serving the same users who were purchasing their remote bridges. Secondly, the sales success of remote bridges demanded more investment and management attention. In October 1986, the management of Vitalink announced a strategic repositioning: to create products filling out their 802 WAN architecture, and cease providing of wide-area networks.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc103&quot; href=&quot;#fn103&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt; Vitalink would focus on interconnecting local area networks using the 802.3 standard. TransLAN would support DECnet, XNS, TCP/IP and similar higher-level protocols. Increased bridge investment led to two new communication software packages, TransSDLC, and the new TransLINK, a frame level multiplexer. Despite these painful choices, the company was still losing money. Pressed for cash, they refinanced their capital equipment and raised $5.5 million, funds needed for product development and working capital.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc104&quot; href=&quot;#fn104&quot;&gt;104&lt;/a&gt;  The good news was that company revenues for 1986 were about to double to $10 million on the strength of remote-bridge sales. The TransLAN represented more than 50% of Vitalink’s revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-14231--vitalink-translan-1985105&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.23.1  Vitalink TransLAN (1985)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc105&quot; href=&quot;#fn105&quot;&gt;105&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_14.23.1_vitalink_translan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diagram of Vitalink TransLAN (1985)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing the drive for innovation and competitive advantage, in early 1987, Vitalink and DEC announced a second important result of their co-development agreement: the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). The STP addressed the need to create loop-free transmission within a topology of Ethernet LANs interconnected with bridges.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc106&quot; href=&quot;#fn106&quot;&gt;106&lt;/a&gt; Before STP, users had to manually interconnect all nodes within a bridge network in order to know that there were no loops; for if loops existed, the entire network could be driven into an overloaded state and cease working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continued double-digit growth of remote-bridge revenues, and the success of the DEC relationship, prompted management to next take an even more drastic and bold decision. In mid-1987, management decided to stop making any investments in the satellite business and to put it on the market for sale, and absent a buyer within a year, to completely close the business down. By the fall, finding little interest among potential buyers, one of the company’s founders, Al Horley, then responsible for the satellite business, resigned in order to negotiate its purchase. Although having minimized the cash drain on Vitalink, the growth of the bridge business required cash. Fortunately the bridge market, and the Internetworking market in general, had become recognized as a “hot” market and investment bankers were calling on Vitalink management and pitching the idea of an IPO now that the satellite business had been in principal terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With revenues of $17.5 million for the fiscal year 1987, and growth of the bridge business exceeding 100%, Vitalink now had access to the public market and the capital they needed to properly finance their growth. On March 3, 1988, Vitalink went public at a price of $8.25/share, selling 2.3 million shares and raising nearly $19 million with a company valuation of $44 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearing the deadline they had set for the sale or closure of the satellite business, in September 1988, Horley organized a new company, Vitacom, and negotiated the final sale of the business for a undisclosed sum.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc107&quot; href=&quot;#fn107&quot;&gt;107&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in November 1988, Vitalink and DEC signed a new agreement giving DEC the right to resell Vitalink’s TransLAN product line directly to its customers. It was likely that this agreement expanded the number of people selling the TransLAN by a factor of ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1988 was another great year for Vitalink with profitable revenues of $37.4 million.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc108&quot; href=&quot;#fn108&quot;&gt;108&lt;/a&gt;  Vitalink was thought to control 70% of the remote bridge market.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Like Vitalink, the founders of Retix would partner with a multi-billion company. In the spring of 1984, Andrew (Andi) De Mari learned that Ing. C. Olivetti SpA of Italy (Olivetti), his former employer, had signed a mega-contract with AT&amp;amp;T, one calling for AT&amp;amp;T to purchase 22% of the ownership of Olivetti, and, among other terms, for Olivetti to supply AT&amp;amp;T with a personal computer AT&amp;amp;T would resell as its own.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc109&quot; href=&quot;#fn109&quot;&gt;109&lt;/a&gt;  De Mari’s entrepreneurial instincts quickly envisioned an opportunity that met his search pattern. Logically, if Olivetti intended to supply a competitive personal computer to AT&amp;amp;T, they would want a source of StarLAN adapter cards. (The “StarLAN” version of Ethernet was a standard AT&amp;amp;T had championed in standards committees as an Ethernet standard for twisted pair wiring, a compelling advantage for the phone company.) Di Mari knew, after contacting former associates within Olivetti, that Olivetti management had no plans to engineer and manufacture a StarLAN card, and would be open to a proposal from Di Mari. Furthermore, De Mari had received unmistakable signals that Olivetti’s venture capital team would be interested in investing in a start-up he headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StarLAN might be a source of sales and venture capital to launch a company, but De Mari doubted it would serve as the basis of an eventual IPO company. In discussions with those he hoped would join him, the idea of focusing on OSI software seemed a wiser strategy.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc110&quot; href=&quot;#fn110&quot;&gt;110&lt;/a&gt;  De Mari remembers a meeting of ten of so engineers in late 1984:&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc111&quot; href=&quot;#fn111&quot;&gt;111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We looked at the networking market, and decided that if we developed products like network bridges and routers that connect networks that didn’t exist at that time, we would surely go out of business. We sensed a growing interest in OSI (Open Systems Interconnection), so we decided to gamble our entire company on the future of OSI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1985, De Mari and the founding team incorporated Retix with an initial investment of $700,000. De Mari knew that he would need to raise significantly more money if Retix was to become an IPO-company, possibly $10 million or more over the next few years. The first step had to be to close Olivetti as a corporate partner, for Olivetti was known as a venture capital investor and, if they decided not to invest in Retix, it signaled the wrong assessment of both Retix’s future business prospects and Olivetti’s confidence in the management of Retix. Meanwhile, thanks to sales of StarLAN adapter cards to Olivetti, sales for 1985 totaled nearly $722,000. If AT&amp;amp;T was successful in selling personal computers, the future of Retix seemed promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The years 1985 and 1986 were consumed with: meeting the needs of Olivetti, i.e. AT&amp;amp;T; developing an OSI business; and building out the company’s infrastructure. While selling StarLAN adapter cards to Olivetti hopefully meant more than selling to AT&amp;amp;T, it was clear that success would be measured by making AT&amp;amp;T successful. The challenge would be to form strong relationships with AT&amp;amp;T personnel without upsetting Olivetti or creating new problems. Developing an OSI business required a continued presence in standard-making bodies; selecting, coding and productizing those standards judged to be the best market opportunities; and creating profitable relationships with the leading companies staking a claim in the emerging OSI market. Most importantly, Retix had to prove it was the OSI leader by providing as much OSI software as possible to the vendors participating in the Enterprise Networking Event (ENE) scheduled for June 1988. Building out the infrastructure included hiring the right people as quickly as possible, growing sales and profits to exceed minimum goals and not just letting sales and profits happen as may, making sure financial resources were always available when needed, and initiating efforts to enter the Internetworking market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1986, Retix closed a $1 million round of Preferred Stock with Olivetti. All was going as hoped, even planned. Then in November 1986, AT&amp;amp;T announced a major shake-up in its flagging computer operations. An untenable loss estimated to be as much as $800 million for 1986 precipitated management and strategy changes.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc112&quot; href=&quot;#fn112&quot;&gt;112&lt;/a&gt;  The news for Retix could be interpreted positively – since ties between AT&amp;amp;T and Olivetti were strengthened when Vittorio Cassoni, an Olivetti senior executive, was named President of AT&amp;amp;T’s newly formed Data Systems Division, i.e. its computer businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retix’s sales soared to $5.2 million ($3.7 million) in 1986.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc113&quot; href=&quot;#fn113&quot;&gt;113&lt;/a&gt; While sales of $1 million to Olivetti reflected AT&amp;amp;T’s problems selling computers, sales of licenses of OSI software more than made up any weakness in StarLAN sales. (Furthermore, sales of MAP licenses represented approximately half of OSI sales.)&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc114&quot; href=&quot;#fn114&quot;&gt;114&lt;/a&gt;  On the other hand, by the end of 1986, the project to develop an Ethernet and StarLAN bridge had fallen an estimated six-months behind plan. The reasons for the delay, difficulties hiring experienced talent in the United States, prompted De Mari to accelerate discussions of international product development and even the possibility of making an acquisition. Conversations ranged from securing a grant from the Irish Development Authority to assessing companies as acquisitions. The focus quickly settled on the U.K. company TSL Communications. The crush of activities also elevated the priority of raising new investment capital from venture capitalists. As warned, venture capitalists quickly voiced a closing condition that a new President with IPO experience be hired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1987, Retix finally entered the Internetworking market with its RetixGate Model 2244: a two-port local bridge interconnecting Ethernet and StarLAN LANs. Even so, Retix was late to market and faced intense competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months later, in August, Retix closed a $5.5 million financing based on a $16 million pre-money valuation. While a new President had not yet been hired, encouraging interviews had been had, and optimism prevailed. Before the end of the year, terms would be finalized with Stephen (Steve) Frankel, formerly with Micom and recently President of Emulex. For mutual reasons, Frankel would consult with Retix for up to a year before becoming an employee. (He formally joined Retix in September 1988.) Helping to close the financing was the prominent role Retix had secured in the upcoming and important ENE show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal year 1987 was another impressive year with revenue growth of 126% to $13.6 million ($10.0 million) and with net income of $560 thousand. The budget for 1988 positioned the company to become a public company. Retix was now recognized as the market leader in the fast-growing OSI- software market with a 50% market share. The OSI market was forecasted to grow from $15 million in 1987 to $164 million in 1991. So far, competitors were other small start-ups: notably Touch Communications, founded by “angel” investor Charles (Charlie) Bass, founder of Ungermann-Bass; and The Wollongong Group of Palo Alto, a leader in the TCP/IP software market, and of comparable size to Retix. International competitors played a more prominent role than usual with: Sydney Development Corporation of Vancouver, B.C., Marben of Paris and Logica of London, all financed with private capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1988 would be an important year for Retix, as it was for most computer communication companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Retix announced its second local bridge: the RetixGate Model 2255, a two-port bridge adding support for Thin Ethernet (the 10BASE2 standard).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in April, the trade press made much of the fact that AT&amp;amp;T had declined to increase its stake in Olivetti, a conversation that had been initiated by Carlo de Benedetti for personal reasons.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc115&quot; href=&quot;#fn115&quot;&gt;115&lt;/a&gt;  Days later, another press release confirmed Cassoni was leaving AT&amp;amp;T and returning to Olivetti as managing directory. As for their 10-year agreement, nothing was said. When Retix management learned that AT&amp;amp;T had cut its purchase orders by 75% is not clear, but likely that spring.  No longer could Retix assume a close and favorable relationship with AT&amp;amp;T, which in turn cast new importance on mounting an aggressive Internetworking strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June came ENE, considered the preeminent event for the Computer Communication industry for 1988. In planning for over two years, if the OSI standards, and especially the MAP/TOP and GOSIP Profiles, were to gain the needed economic momentum to displace the existing Computer Communication standards, such as TCP/IP, SNA and DECNET, companies had to leave ENE convinced to convert to OSI –immediately. For Retix, it was the opportunity to demonstrate their OSI leadership, in particular with X.400 and Directory Services (email), and to introduce key new products (X.400 and FTAM end user products and a MAP 3.0 compliant MAC Level bridge) to bolster OSI sales.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc116&quot; href=&quot;#fn116&quot;&gt;116&lt;/a&gt; Retix would fare better than did the Show itself, for the Corporation of Open Standards (COS) failed to have their conformance testing software ready, leaving critics to conclude: “user acceptance of OSI, is still a season away.” That assessment notwithstanding, Retix’s sales of OSI technology and products received a big boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, in an aggressive step to boost its position in the Internetworking market, Retix acquired all the outstanding common stock of TSL Communications Ltd. In a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests, Retix now had a source of its remote bridge products, engineering personnel and the European market presence that would have taken years to accomplish otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues for 1988 grew 99% to $27.0 million ($21.3 million) with net income of $822 thousand. While management had successfully grown two new product lines in exciting emerging markets - OSI Technology and Products as well as Local and Remote Bridges – Retix’s future remained tied to the outcome of the Olivetti and AT&amp;amp;T relationship and of AT&amp;amp;T’s ability to sell personal computers. (See Exhibit 12.17 Retix Revenue Mix 1988)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-14241--retix-revenue-mix-1988&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.24.1  Retix Revenue Mix 1988&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenues ($M)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percent of Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;LAN Controllers (Olivetti)&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11,659&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;43.2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;OSI Technology and Products&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6,187&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;22.9&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Internetworking (Bridges)&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6,672&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;24.7&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Support and Custom Engineering&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2,475&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9.2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26,993&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty, and thus challenge, in the 1989 financial plan was forecasting a high revenue growth rate and profitability consistent with the last three years in order to qualify for an IPO, and to do so without knowing what AT&amp;amp;T and Olivetti were going to do, or if OSI was really going to take off.&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "false","content" : "&lt;p&gt;Now to switch our level of observation from the histories of individual Computer Communication firms to the perspective of the Market-structure as a whole. One important question is: How did the sales of products change over time, independent of the firms that sold them? (See Exhibit 12.18 - The Computer Communications Market-structure 1982-1988&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc117&quot; href=&quot;#fn117&quot;&gt;117&lt;/a&gt;) In the short span of four years, 1985 -1988, the revenue of the Computer Communications Market doubled, its growth rate leaping to 32% in 1988 on the back of the 68% growth in LANs. Obviously, not all products were doing as well as others, such as the stagnating category of Data Modems compared to LANs. It is easy to see why Codex was under pressure to find another product to fuel sales growth like LANs; sales of Data Modems having been flat since 1984. Or, if a company selling primarily multiplexers didn’t also sell T-1 Multiplexers, they were likely having problems, or were seeking to merge (Timeplex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-14251-the-computer-communications-market-structure-1982-1988&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.25.1 The Computer Communications Market-Structure 1982-1988&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_14.25.1_computer_communications_market_structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Computer Communications Market-Structure 1982-1988&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequently graphing data shows trends more clearly: While the total Computer Communications Market was growing rapidly, it was better to be a Networking, than Data Communications, company. (See Exhibit 12.19 Composition of the Computer Communications Market 1982-1988) Even that conclusion requires more investigation: for if a Data Communications firm focused exclusively on T-1 Multiplexers, then it participated in a market growing at 25% in 1988; even so, the leading firm in T-1 Multiplexers, NET, grew at the impressive rate of 50% in 1988; faster than many Networking companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhibit-14252-composition-of-the-computer-communications-market-1982-1988&quot;&gt;Exhibit 14.25.2 Composition of the Computer Communications Market 1982-1988&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ex_14.25.2_computer_communications_market_composition.png&quot; alt=&quot;Composition of the Computer Communications Market 1982-1988&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reveal the significant change waiting to happen, I will take advantage of my slow writing and make use of market results up to 2010. The size of the Internetworking Market in 1988 was only $175 million. Yet within ten years, the annual sales of one Internetworking firm - cisco Systems - will exceed the 1988 sales of Computer Communications (i.e., $5 billion). A few years later, the market capitalization of cisco Systems will explode to $555 billion, exceeding that of any company of its time, including AT&amp;amp;T and IBM!&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc118&quot; href=&quot;#fn118&quot;&gt;118&lt;/a&gt;  The irony is, in 1968, AT&amp;amp;T and IBM were more concerned with each other’s markets than the “insignificant” Computer Communications Market. Or maybe the delaying actions of IBM in the Networking Market in the early 1980’s were grounded in fear not ignorance. In both cases, AT&amp;amp;T and IBM didn’t take computer communications seriously, but entrepreneurs, and the start-ups they founded, did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From earlier, the Emergent phase of both Data Communications and Networking was dominated by start-ups. From Exhibit 12.20 below (1988 Bridge and Router Installed Bases), only the Internetworking start-up cisco Systems held an early market share advantage in the two products defining the Internetworking Market – bridges and routers.&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc119&quot; href=&quot;#fn119&quot;&gt;119&lt;/a&gt;  Further analysis will reveal, however, that the “Other” category includes many start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspectives gained by analyzing macro conditions reveals that the early advantages Networking companies held in bridges did not easily transfer to routers. One question then becomes: if so much gain awaits the successful firm, and with the existing firms holding the advantages, how did the start-ups once again prevail? The insurmountable advantages routers had over bridges may not have been known, or maybe acknowledged, in 1985, or even 1988. The advantages of routers may also have been very difficult to master, or required making difficult choices. Some firms found merging into larger firms preferable to taking financial risks that could lead to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 14.25.3 1988 Bridge and Router Installed Base&lt;a name=&quot;fnloc20&quot; href=&quot;#fn20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installed Base Market Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DEC&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2Com&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Vitalink&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ungermann-Bass&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Proteon&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;cisco Systems&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;28%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to many of these questions, and more, will be found in the histories of the firms, and the dynamics of the Market Sectors, in the decades following 1988. Hopefully, the interested reader will return to this historical reconstruction, the interviews of 1988, the various Oral Collections of the Computer History Museum, and other archives. I hope you contact Marc Weber (marc@webhistory.org), who is Founder and Curator of the Internet History Program at CHM, if you have questions and to offer your historical material to CHM for Permanent preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Perspective: A Personal Remark&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When conceived in 1987, I never would have imagined that I would be writing these words on the eve of 2014. That I am is an unmistakable signal that I should conclude. So as much as I care for this history, and the gracious individuals whom I interviewed, and met along the way, it is time to say good-bye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, my intention was to reconstruct this history through the experiences and recollections of those who were there. I wanted to capture the emotional nature of innovation and building companies. I felt my personal experiences with growing companies would enable me to write these histories with a unique point-of-view. When it came time to finish the final chapters, I found myself bogged down. Eventually, I realized that, in large measure, it was because I was not retelling the history through the “eyes” of the participants, but from reports and information I found in the trade press of the time. I didn’t have any interviews, or material from interviews, to use, for 85% of the interviewing was finished by the end of July 1985. A mistake I made, one I realized to late to correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also made the decision early in the process to not include gossip or ungenerous comments in the text. I hope I have also eliminated any such remarks from the interviews. It certainly was my intention. I know I lost some intrigue in doing so, but I never felt the historical record was compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last issue is whether my knowing the turn of events after 1988 unduly influenced the reconstruction. Obviously, I hope not. I sent drafts of the chapters to those involved as well as having dialogue with many of the people whom I had interviewed to cross check my conclusions. Ultimately, only through the work of other historians will my work be proven useful. Lastly, I hope my largely unedited writing keeps the reader engaged, providing both an enjoyable and informative read. I certainly gained immeasurable regard for the work of historians as a result of this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is it. Thank you, and I hope I have convinced you of the importance of these events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Pelkey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;December, 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kula, HI&lt;/p&gt;","footnotes" : [{

      "appendix" : "true","content" : "&lt;p&gt;The two corporate financial statements that contain most of the information used in this investigation are the Income Statement and Balance Sheet. Data is publicly available unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Income Statement reports period sales and expenses and calculates whether profits have been earned. Profits are essential, for if the company is not profitable, it is not generating new capital. Growth requires additional capital and, if the company is not generating the needed capital, it either has to raise more capital by selling stock (or potentially borrowing money) or deplete its existing capital. Once expenses cannot be covered by either profits or capital, the company is insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue Less Expenses = Profit or Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;: Revenue is usually recognized when product is shipped or service has been performed. Revenue that has been recognized, but for which payment has not been received, is classified as Accounts Receivable (See Balance Sheet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;: All period expenses for this investigation will be defined as follows: Costs and expenses are synonymous. All expenses other than Direct Costs are often called Overhead and, in this convention, would be the sum of Technological Innovation, Buying Demand and Organization expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: All expenses that are directly related to product shipped or services performed. Material costs, direct labor, allocated production overhead and shipping costs are the major Direct Cost categories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually labeled Engineering or Research and Development, Technological Innovation expenses represent those period costs associated with innovating new and improving existing products. Companies often amortize some development costs over the life of the product rather than report costs as incurred.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Demand&lt;/strong&gt;: All Sales and Marketing expenses. Unfortunately, over time accounting conventions have changed and some Buying Demand costs have been combined with Organization expenses. Likewise, commissions paid on sales are often reported as Direct Costs rather than as Overhead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization&lt;/strong&gt;: Normally referred to as General Expenses, Organization costs are those not directly tied to either innovating or selling product. Executive management, accounting, finance and facilities expenses constitute the bulk of Organization expenses. Interest expense, or income, is usually reported as a separate line item.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profit or Loss&lt;/strong&gt;: Generally called Net Income, and is Revenue less all expenses. Most companies report both an Operating Income as well as Net Income. Operating Income is Revenue less all Expenses other than Interest and Extraordinary expenses, where Extraordinary are one-time write-offs due to corporate re-organizations or changes in business practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross Margin = Revenue Less Direct Costs&lt;/strong&gt;. Gross Margin is a very important indicator of the value of a company’s product as well as the pricing freedom a company has. The higher the Gross Margin the more value provided and freedom in pricing. As a general rule, companies that sell systems direct to end user customers will have a Gross Margin of 65% or more whereas companies that sell product through distribution have difficulty maintaining a Gross Margin of 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cycle of Investment and Profits&lt;/strong&gt;: When a company first starts out, its challenge is to innovate product. Having no sales, it raises risk, or venture, capital, to fund product development and begin building its distribution system. This start-up stage generally lasts from one to two years. Once the company begins to sell and service product, additional financing is required to fund organization ramp-up, including the acquisition of Fixed Assets and Inventory and financing of Accounts Receivable (See Balance Sheet). If the company is successful, by its third or fourth year, it will be generating profits that finance continued company growth and eventually earn a return for those equity - venture capital - investors who supported the company in its earlier years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initial Public Offering (IPO)&lt;/strong&gt;: For the successful company, the ideal way to raise both inexpensive capital to fund growth as well as provide a mechanism for investors to realize a return without forcing the company to distribute Net Income, is to sell shares of stock in a public offering. Once a company is public, all investors, subject to certain rules of course, can sell and buy stock without the company having to do anything other than comply with disclosure and reporting requirements. If the demand for the company’s shares of stock is strong, the price per share will go up. If so, the company can benefit by selling more shares and raise even more capital at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/a.10/Balance-Sheet-Analysis/",

Data is publically available unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Balance Sheet summarizes the financial transactions of a company from one moment in time to a next. All the transactions of the Income Statement will be summarized into the Balance Sheet. Profit, hence capital, is reported as Net Worth. Insolvency is when Liabilities are greater than Assets. An important measure of organization success is having a Fair Market Value many times larger than Net Worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt;: A growing company has to build assets to support increasing revenues. Assets can be one of three types: Current, Fixed or Other. All Assets are valued at the lower of cost or Fair Market Value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Assets&lt;/strong&gt;: All Assets with an expected life of one year or less. The major categories of Current Assets are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash and Marketable Securities&lt;/strong&gt;: The most liquid Assets. A critical buffer to protect against cash flow problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounts Receivable&lt;/strong&gt;: Uncollected Revenues. Accounts Receivable are always reduced by a reserve for Receivables judged uncollectable..&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory&lt;/strong&gt;: Direct Costs on hand to meet incoming orders. There are three broad categories of Inventory: Raw Material, Work-in-Process and Finished Goods. The values of Work-in-Process and Finished Goods include the costs of Direct Labor incurred and an estimate of other indirect production costs called Burden. The inventory policy of a company depends on how fast a company wants to ship Product after receipt of customer orders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Assets&lt;/strong&gt;: Plant, property and equipment. Net Fixed Assets are Assets reduced by Depreciation, the period expense of writing off the value of an Asset over its estimated useful life. Land is also a Fixed Asset but is not depreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Assets&lt;/strong&gt;: A catch all category for all Assets other than Current and Fixed Assets. Ignorable in this investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: As with Assets, Liabilities are sub-divided into Liabilities that must be settled in less than one year, Current Liabilities, and those with a maturity of greater than one year, Long Term Liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Current Liabilities: For our purposes, Current Liabilites will be one of four   types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounts Payable&lt;/strong&gt;: Amounts owed to vendors. Favorable terms from vendors is an important source of financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Costs Payable&lt;/strong&gt;: All Employee costs owed but not paid. Includes payroll, commissions, vacations, payroll taxes and sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxes Payable&lt;/strong&gt;: Federal and State corporate tax liability not paid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debt Payable&lt;/strong&gt;: Bank or other borrowings that must be paid within one year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Term Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Liabilities that do not come due in less than one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Worth&lt;/strong&gt;: There are two sources of Net Worth or Capital: the sale of stock or Profits. All shareholders are motivated to minimize the sale of stock and look to the company to earn Capital through earnings; the less stock sold, the more of the company owned by existing shareholders. Net Worth is minimally reported as one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Stock&lt;/strong&gt;: The par value of all outstanding shares of Common and Preferred Stock. The par value represents a minimum value placed on the stock by the company. Par value of common stock is usually $.01 per share.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Surplus&lt;/strong&gt;: The value actually received by a company for the stock it sells or distributes less its par value. The sum of Capital Stock and Capital Surplus equals the value of the Capital raised by the company from selling or distributing stock.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retained Earnings&lt;/strong&gt;: Retained earnings are the cumulative Profits and Losses of the company. In the early years, when a company pays expenses from capital raised from selling stock, Retained Earnings will be a negative number. If the negative Retained Earnings grow to be greater than the Capital Stock and Surplus, the company is insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Capital&lt;/strong&gt;:  Working Capital = Current Assets - Current LiabilitiesA measure of the Capital required to finance the growth of Current Assets to grow the business. The essential relationship within Working Capital is: Accounts Receivable + Inventory - Accounts Payable - Debt Payable. A company that grows rapidly must grow its Working Capital to sustain its ability to ship Product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Value&lt;/strong&gt;: The primary method used to value companies in this investigation is the extension of the number of shares of stock outstanding times the current fair market value of a share of stock. The greater the company value to the Capital Stock and Surplus, the better the company has been as an investment.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/a.11/Financial-Histories-Aligned-by-IPO-Year/",

Dominant design decided by technology competition: local area networks vs. Data PBXs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the years 1982-1986, existing data communication companies responded to first, the terminal interconnection, then, computer interconnection buying demand with Data PBXs. Startups emerged to sell and innovate local area networks. By 1986, the competition was over. Local area networks had won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-pbx-vs-lan-revenues--m&quot;&gt;Data PBX vs. LAN Revenues ($ M)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1982&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1983&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1985&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1986&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1987&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1988&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAGR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data PBX&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;77&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;119&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;143&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;86&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;82&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10.10%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;LAN&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;63&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;152&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;326&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;593&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;913&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1675&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2820&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;88.40%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source of data: Dataquest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2.   Dominant design decided by marketing and sales competition: PC modem vs. dial-up modems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Hayes Microcomputer Products introduced a low speed dial-up modem designed for use with a personal computer to be sold through computer retail stores. Even though the opportunity was open to all existing manufacturers, Hayes acted first, establishing its name as a brand name synonymous with personal computer modems. All subsequent entrants had to conform to the modem commands and software innovated by Hayes. By 1986, Hayes had become the fourth largest modem manufacturer with sales of $120 million, and a 43% market share in the fastest growing modem market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-modem-vs-pc-modem-revenues--m&quot;&gt;Data Modem vs. PC Modem Revenues ($ M)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;thead&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1982&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1983&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1985&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1986&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1987&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1988&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAGR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/thead&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Data Modems&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;675&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;791&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;866&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;934&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;962&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;993&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;873&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.40%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;PC Modems&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;182&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;233&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;281&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;307&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;389&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;26.30%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source of data: Dataquest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 3.   Dominant design decided by a standards body: V.32 vs. proprietary modems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the success of the V.22 and v.22bis CCITT modem standards, existing vendors were motivated to  adopt a 9600 baud dial-up modem standard to jointly solve remaining difficult technical problems and to accelerate market acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the CCITT V.32 standard was approved in 1985, it wasn’t until 1987-1988 that competitive v.32 modems entered the market to compete with proprietary modems then capable of communicating at speeds twice that of V.32.

So they took their knowledge and contacts - and did as so many entrepreneurial engineers of the day - and lived on winning defense contracts. But the uncertainty of whether there would be another timely contract, or maybe even another one period, led Cryer and Kohlenberg down the path of innovating data communication products. First they needed a product worthy of their intellectual heritage. Learning of Jerry Holsinger, who had innovated a 9600 bit per second modem, they quickly negotiated the acquisition of his struggling company. Although deep in technical talent, for example G. David Forney (and in the years ahead engineers and scientists such as Ken Miller and John Day), they needed experienced management and hired Art Carr, who in turn hired John Pugh. Their timing could not have been better. In December 1968, just before the Initial Public Offering market for technology companies closed, Codex went public, raising $2.1 million, a sum once unimaginable and soon to be as if imagined. Soon out of cash and living on begged bank borrowings, Codex management found venture capital investors hungry to make a “cheap” technology investment. Within a few years, management and engineers, tempered by the brink of disaster and aided by a creative Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, successfully innovated both high speed lease-line modems and statistical multiplexers; the only company to master both technologies in-house. By 1979, as they were becoming the leading Data Communication company, management agreed to be acquired by the much larger Motorola Corporation to buffer their future from both technological and competitive uncertainties. Then came their efforts to leverage their market power and enter both the emerging Networking and Internetworking markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;codex-historical-critical-dates&quot;&gt;Codex Historical Critical Dates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;1962 – Codex Founded&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;1968 – Art Carr joins.

Soon they attracted both talent and venture capital investors and, before the end of 1968, introduced their revolutionary time division multiplexer. Far superior to the existing frequency division multiplexers, ADS was soon riding the success of their ADS-660 to sales of an astonishing $5 million in 1969. Burning cash at an equally voracious rate, and not having access to the now vanished public market, management turned to the attractive arms of a corporate investor, North American Rockwell, a key semiconductor chip supplier and a major defense and space contractor. it was a defense contract that had led to their innovating a high speed lease-line modem, one they were willing to let ADS commercialize. ADS management was soon to learn, as had Codex management before them, that successfully mastering the problems of a high speed lease-line modem was harder than thought. In the span of a few years, ADS was bankrupt. One indefatigable engineer, Bill Norred, refused to give up, however, and armed with a contract from an existing customer desperately needed a version of an ADS multiplexer, incorporated Micom. He soon recruited Roger Evans to join him and, after one crises after another and last minute venture capital investment, they innovated a low cost statistical multiplexer. They could not manufacturer their Micro800 Data Concentrator fast enough. In 1981, Micom went public with a market capitalization of $190 million. Needing more management they recruited Steve Frankel. Micom too was pulled into the emerging Networking and Internetworking markets, although they tried through acquisition: Interlan and Spectrum Digital. Paul Severino, a founder of Interlan, served as Vice-President of Product Planning and Technology, before he would leave to found Wellfleet Communications. In 1988, Micom’s fortunes had withered and a leverage buyout firm took Micom private and in the process dismantled what had been a darling of Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/c.3/3Com/",

The daunting challenge was to pry Ethernet from the proprietary grasp of Xerox. He began consulting. Luck prevailed when a consulting project with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) led to his getting Xerox, DEC and then Intel to begin conversations that would quickly lead to their working to make Ethernet a public standard. Knowing becoming a factor in the coming commercialization of Ethernet required more than being a consultant, Metcalfe formed 3Com in June 1979. Then, to close a round of venture capital, Metcalfe recruited Bill Krause from Hewlett Packard to be President. Along with engineers who had worked for Metcalfe at Xerox, such as Yogen Dalal and James White, 3Com focused on the nascent personal computer market to the exclusion of other niches such as the terminal-to-computer markets. Their strategy proved successful and 3Com went public in March 1984. In 1985, a proposed merger with Convergent Technologies seemed to be the fruition of a vision of personal computer networking; only the merger was called off at the last hour. 3Com then consummated a merger with Bridge Communications in 1987. Subsequently, 3Com would be a market force in both Networking and Internetworking. In later years, 3Com would enter the Data Communications market with the acquisition of U.S. Robotics Corporation&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/c.4/Ungermann-Bass/",

After talking with a wide assortment of experts, he formulated a vision of an independent local area networking company. In time, the vision would be expanded to encompass not just one, or a few technologies, but interconnecting many of the LAN technologies customers wanted to buy. Knowing he needed a team of seasoned technologists, he turned first to Charlie Bass. Disgruntled with Zilog, Bass readily agreed to join Ungermann and, in July 1979, they founded Ungermann-Bass. Quickly they recruited others they knew were dissatisfied working at Zilog including Judith Estrin and John Davidson. But when it came to closing their first round of venture capital, they were forced to bring a seasoned marketing and sales executive aboard. They then met Jim Jordan, vice-president of sales of Four-Phase Systems, who had been unsuccessful in getting management to take the early generation LAN of Datapoint seriously. On joining Ungermann-Bass, venture capitalists agreed to invest. Swept forward by the demand of corporations needing to interconnect their growing bases of computers, Ungermann-Bass went public on June 23, 1983 with a company valuation of $288 million. They had seized leadership of the emerging Networking market sector. But trying to master all technologies would prove expensive and, in 1988, Tandem Computers acquired Ungermann-Bass for $274 million.&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/c.5/Network-Equipment-Technologies/",

Little did they anticipate that by August Case would part company to lead an effort to start yet another T-1 start-up: Cohesive Systems. The loss of Case forced MacLean and Chrisman to recruit engineering talent, for example Walt Gill and Robbie Forkish, and, before they could close their first round of venture capital a President, Bruce Smith. It would take nearly a year, until August 1983, before they closed their first round of venture capital and Network Equipment Technologies (NET) was formally founded. In September 1984, they shipped their beta release of the Integrated Digital Network Exchange (IDNX) T-1 multiplexer and secured a second round of venture capital. In January 1985, NET began shipping IDNX’s for revenue. Success came fast. Profitability was attained in the second quarter of 1986 and NET went public in January 1987 with a post money valuation of nearly $200 million. In 1987, market pressures and distribution strategies led management to acquire a Data Communication company, ComDesign, sign contracts with computer companies, IBM and Hewlett Packard. Distribution contracts with other Internetworking companies such as Newbridge Networks and Network Systems, would follow. In 1988, NET attempted to acquire a LAN company, Excelan, and successfully signed a development contract with cisco Systems. The future would not always be so easy.

Severino, who had founded Interlan in May 1981 to sell Ethernet products, concluded the under-capitalized Interlan needed a safe-haven and engineered the acquisition by Micom on March 1, 1985 for $65 million. He then assumed the role of Micom vice-president for corporate strategy. Only a staff position did not fit the entrepreneurial Severino and, in September 1985, he left to find a new opportunity around which to start a new company. Looking first at the allegedly hot manufacturing market, he failed to find a compelling idea. What kept returning was the need to interconnect LANs with T-1 circuits: the nascent Internetworking market. Wellfleet announced its first product before yearend 1987 and began shipping product for revenue in the middle of 1988. They would become a leader in the emerging Internetworking market along with cisco Systems. Wellfleet would go public in 1991 and merge with Synoptics in 1994 to form Bay Networks.

He then took as he says, “a pretty big gamble,” and accepted a professorship at the University of Hawaii (1968- ).That big gamble quickly paid off, for in the next year the Department of Defense announced the Themis program to aggressively fund research at “second tier” universities, universities like the University of Hawaii. Abramson, who very much wanted to do research, teamed up with two of his new faculty members, Wes Peterson and Ned Weldon, and others, and conceived a research program that was funded by ARPA and managed by Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts at the IPTO. To become known as ALOHAnet, it proved that broadcast radio communications could be the basis of an inter-island communication system. As important as this finding was, how ALOHAnet influenced Bob Metcalfe’s thinking and led to Ethernet is the story investigated in this interview and the interviews with Metcalfe, Charlie Bass and John Davidson: for Ethernet is one of the important and crowning achievements in the early history of computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Baran helped me in ways beyond identifying people I should interview. For example, at the time, Paul and Bill Houser were meeting with Norm Abramson to see if there was a way they could help him start a company around technologies dating back to ALOHAnet. On this occasion, Norm was visiting them at Interfax, one of the start-ups Paul and Bill were engaged in launching. Knowing I wanted to interview Norm, they invited me to meet with him at Interfax. I gladly accepted. I am sure that Norm, on seeing how my friends welcomed me, created a level of trust that facilitated our conversation. This is a wonderful story of how it is not necessary to know the objectives or benefits of research if there is sufficient funding, highly qualified and motivated researchers, a supportive network of collaborators and a management style that recognizes managing technical research is vastly different than managing a profit and loss operation.

He spent his entire career in industry, working for Dow Chemical, GE, Honeywell, Cullinane Database Systems, and his own startup Bachman Information Systems. His work at GE in the early 1960’s, building the first company-wide database management system, called Integrated Data Store (IDS), allowed users across the company to access a common database. In 1973 he was awarded the ACM Turing Award for this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bachman also devoted a significant portion of his career to advancing international standards. In 1975 he was asked to join the ANSI SPARC Study Group on Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) that ultimately recommended a 3-layer architecture for DBMS. In ’77 he chaired the ANSI SPARC study group on Distributed Systems, which was tasked with providing recommendations for architecture and protocols for network connections. They would present their recommendations to a new ISO sub-committee, ISO TC97/SC16 on Open Systems Interconnect. When the ANSI group was given the secretariat of SC16, Bachman was the logical person to assume the chairmanship, though there was initial opposition from IBM on the grounds that the chair should be neutral. Bachman was, in his words, “an aggressive chairman,” setting a tight schedule for their work, and pushing the committee to deliver on what he viewed as important work. His proposal of a multi-layer model of network communications, based on his work on HDSA, Honeywell’s proprietary networking architecture, became the committee’s working document. The OSI reference model was adopted by ISO in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he is mostly remembered for his early work on database management systems, Bachman left an indelible mark on the evolution of computer communication by skillfully advancing his vision for computer networking through the international standardization process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met with Charles at his office at Bachman Information Systems, overlooking the Charles River. He was surprised when I told him my main interest was his work on the OSI reference model, as most of the interviews he had given focused on his database work. He was a pleasure to interview and spoke thoughtfully and clearly about his experiences. I could see how not only his technical knowledge, but also his understanding of people, gave him a unique ability to inspire others to work collaboratively toward a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Database Management System, IDS, ANSI SPARC, distributed systems, ISO TC97/SC16, Open Systems Interconnect (OSI), OSI model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738717-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles Bachman Interviewed by James Pelkey 10/26/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Paul-Baran/",

Little did I know at the time that lifelong friendships would be formed with Paul Baran, William Houser, and Steve Millard, PT’s founder and Chief Scientist, CEO, and CFO, respectively. Baran’s hyperactively creative mind soon conceived an innovative technology for a high-speed modem that became the basis for a new company, Telebit, launched across Bubb Road from PT. On learning about Telebit, our Venture Fund soon led the investment round and I joined the Board of Directors. My relationship with Baran blossomed and when, years later, I shared with him my idea to write a history book reconstructing the years between 1968 to 1988 for computer communications, he could not have been more encouraging. In addition to this very frank interview, he willingly introduced me to many of the key people whom I interviewed, read early drafts of my work and was always available to answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baran is a leading figure in the Arpanet story. After graduating from Drexel University in 1949, he joined the early computer start-up: Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company. He next married Evelyn Murphy, and they left for Los Angeles, where he joined Hughes Aircraft and enrolled in UCLA, earning his Masters in 1959. He then joined RAND Corporation, where he made his seminal contribution to this history by conceiving a communication system based on the use of sending “blocks” as opposed to creating “circuits.” Baran did not use the word “packets” but rather “blocks” or “message-blocks,” leaving it for Donald Davies a few years later to coin the expression “packet-switching” to name this new technology. (See Donald Davies interview)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Baran is as fine a gentleman, as it has been my privilege to know. He essentially became my absent father, and I have no doubts affected others in the same way. He was gracious, humble, caring, compassionate, always willing to lend a helping hand, and believed that the act of innovation was a team effort. I never heard him voice a critical word of anyone. By 1988, his list of successful start-ups includes StrataCom, Telebit, Institute for the Future and Metricom.

In 1967, UH received a THEMIS ARPA grant that would have important implications for both the University and Bass. For Bass, over the next four years, Principal Investigators and ARPA personnel would be frequent visitors to UH, introducing Bass to some of the best young research scientists of the day. The THEMIS funding meant UH could attract more faculty and students, such as Bass and John Davidson, who became friends and life-long colleagues. A third important event was in 1972, when Robert Metcalfe came to UH to study the ALOHAnet in order to finish his thesis. Metcalfe, Bass and Davidson became friends. Consequently, Bass was no stranger to the people and events of his day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bass received his Ph.D in Electrical Engineering in 1972, he accepted a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley. Happy though he was in academia, in 1975, a mutual friend introduced him to Ralph Ungermann who was co-founding Zilog Inc. with Federico Faggin and substantial financial backing from Exxon Enterprises. Bass decided to join Zilog and began teaching at Stanford University. When Ungermann had a falling out with Exxon during the latter half of 1978, and was fired at year-end, Ungermann and Bass had grown closer, to the extent that when Ungermann began contemplating his future, he invited Bass to join him. After months of deliberation, they founded Ungermann-Bass (UB) in July 1979, and settled on a local area networking, or LAN, product able to connect from eight to thirty-two terminals to host computers over Ethernet using the XNS protocol, named the NIU-1. Bass recounts these days in absorbing detail; up through his hoping to create a “home run” product with IBM. He also describes learning in 1984 that IBM had committed to MAP, the Manufacturing Automation Protocol, and thus OSI, or Open System Interconnection protocols. Bass had convinced Ungermann; then GE came looking for a partner and INI was created. MAP proved to be a false hope. Bass confesses it was “the biggest flaw in his crystal ball ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the spring of 1985, Bass began feeling “disenfranchised” within UB and resigned. As he weighed his alternatives, he unexpectedly received a call from Steve Schwartz, Assistant Group Executive for Telecommunication Products for IBM, offering him a consulting assignment assisting IBM to determine their telecommunication strategy. He was soon “wandering the hallways of IBM.” Nearly a year later, in late 1986, Bass returned to California and rejoined the UB Board of Directors. UB had become a very different company, however: “it was drifting” until the stock market crash of October 1987, when DCA suddenly put the company into financial “play.” Bass had had enough and resigned again. In 1989 Tandem acquired UB for $274 million. That same year, Bass launched his venture capital fund, Bass Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this interview was conducted after 1988, Bass remembers in detail the events of the day, many of which are supported by the interviews of others. Stories of particular importance include; the product planning meetings at Zilog; UB’s struggle to settle on a company strategy; how Sytek became UB’s arch rival; the drama surrounding UB’s Ethernet chip; how Bass closed a deal to develop IBM’s token ring bridge; the acquisitions of both Amdax and Pyramid; and how UB won the Texas Instruments contract to build a PC and how it led to the next generation Terminal Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: UH; Zilog, Inc.; Sytek; Ungermann-Bass, Inc.

He received his B.S.E.E. (1956) and M.S.E.E. (1957) from M.I.T. In 1960, Kenneth Olsen and Harlan Anderson the co-founders of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), recruited Bell to join their start-up. For the next six years (1960-1966), Bell made major contributions to the PDP-1, including designing the first UART chip. He was also the principal architect of the PDP-4 and PDP-6 computers. He then left DEC to join the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University to teach computer science (1966-1972). In 1973, Bell rejoined DEC where he became vice-president of engineering in charge of developing the VAX computer, DEC’s most successful computer. Through out this period, Bell was also a member of the ARPA community. Tragically, Bell suffered a heart attack in 1983, and shortly thereafter resigned from DEC. Not content ‘taking it easy,’ he founded Encore Computer that advanced the state of computer design. Unsuccessful yet not discouraged, Bell next became one of the founders of Ardent Computers in 1986. In 1988 he became vice-president of R&amp;amp;D, the position he held when he agreed to sit for this interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell also gave me a valuable introduction to Stu Wecker, the creator of DECnet, who I would also interview.

He first began working on modems during his last few years with GTE Lenkurt (1959-1969). Next he worked on modems at Fairchild (1969-1970), before switching to Memorex (1970-1972) to do the same. When he presented some novel ideas on multiplexing to management, he realized that the same thing had happened to him as it had at Fairchild, management had lost their commitment to develop their own modems. Feeling as though he had come up with something important, he contacted Dennis Anderson, an engineer he had worked with at Fairchild who he knew was now Chief Engineer at Vadic. He was invited to present his ideas to Anderson, Kim Maxwell and Ted Saunders. Maxwell questioned if his filtering ideas would work with more channels? Bingham left with an invitation to return. After a few weeks Bingham returned to explain to the Vadic engineers how it would work. They weren’t sure, but hired him to work in June 1972 to design a new 1200 bps full duplex modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team released the VA3400 in May 1975. But it would not be until 1976 when the VA3400, the first robust 1200 bps full duplex modem on the market, was perfected. It was a good time for Vadic until AT&amp;amp;T introduced their competitive Bell 212 in September 1976. The bad news: the Bell 212 also supported the Bell 103, which the VA3400 didn’t. The Vadic engineers scrambled as UDS and others introduced their products. It was almost 1979 before a product conceived by Maxwell and engineered by Bingham, a modem that responded as if it were a Bell 103, a Bell 212 or a VA3400 depending on the calling modem was perfected. The VA3467 became known as the “triple modem” and because of it the sales of Vadic skyrocketed. All to the advantage of Racal Electronics who had recently bought Vadic as a means to resolve shareholder discontent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bingham would work on other projects in the years ahead but none as impactful as the VA3467. By 1985, when Bingham resigned, Vadic had grown to nearly $100M company and had become the largest dial-up modem company behind AT&amp;amp;T, all based on technologies that no one thought possible and through unfortunate error, Vadic lost its patents; patents that would be nearly as valuable as the profits on its product sales. Bingham retired with the title of manager of the Advanced Development Department of Racal-Vadic Corporation a subsidiary of Racal Electronics PLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Vadic, VA3400 modem, VA3467 modem, Racal Electronics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/09/102738563-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Bingham Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/23/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Edward-Botwinick/",

Less known is that Botwinick was a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. After graduating from the Columbia School of Engineering with a BSEE in 1958, he worked for US Semiconductor Corp. He then co-founded Silicon Transistor Corp. in 1960 that after going public, was acquired in 1963. Between 1963 and 1967, he served as President and principal shareholder of Quantum Inc. Next he joined Goldman Sachs, a leading investment bank, as vice-president of high-technology investment research and venture capital. There he learned of an investment opportunity in American Data Systems (ADS), the company that innovated the time-division multiplexer, or TDM. Although deciding to invest, he followed the success of ADS and the rapid growth of the TDM market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when he read of a team of Western Union and Bell Lab engineers seeking capital to launch a TDM company, he became an investor, even qualifying as a founder, and member of the Board of Directors. In anticipation of a sale of stock to the public in September 1972, Botwinick resigned from the Board. TIX was one of the last technology companies to go public before a market crash of technology stocks. He rejoined the Board in May 1977, was elected chairman in June, and became full-time chairman and CEO on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years to follow he had to solve financial problems, out-maneuver other shareholders to take ownership control, before launching a succession of increasingly successful statistical multiplexer products beginning in 1980; culminating in the LINK family of T-1 multiplexers. As successful as TIX is against its traditional competitors – General DataComm and Infotron –- one new startup, Network Equipment Technologies (NET), not bound by an installed base of products, gained an insurmountable lead that motivated TIX into merging with Unisys in November 1987. He then became President of Unisys Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Botwinick in his old Timeplex executive offices in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. Since Montgomery Securities had been involved with three rounds of public financing for TIX, Botwinick expected me to be better prepared for the interview than I was. So there we sat, me uncomfortable, and him unyielding. When I finally forged forward, asking him about the early days of TIX, he gave details about the evolution of the company and their successful line of TDM’s and statistical multiplexers, but I did not have time to ask him about the more recent history of the company, including their line of T-1 Multiplexers. Botwinick led the company successfully for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Timeplex, Time Division Multiplexer, LINK multiplexers, UNISYS Corporation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738718-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edward Botwinick Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/10/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Art-Carr/",

While Carr was no longer involved in computer communications, he had been an important executive in the early formation of the Data Communication industry. After serving in the United States Navy (1951-1955), Carr joined Remington Rand Univac as a field technical specialist working out of Boston. He next joined Computer Control Corporation (C3) Honeywell (1961-1968) where he rose to Director of Marketing. He joined Codex Corporation in Manesfield, MA in 1968 as vice-president of Marketing. In 1970, Carr became President, chief executive officer and director. After the acquisition of Codex by Motorola, Inc. in 1979, Carr was appointed vice-president of Motorola. In 1982, he became executive vice-president and general manager of the Information Systems Group, a position he held until he left Motorola in 1986. His responsibilities included Codex, Universal Data Systems and the minicomputer manufacturer Four-Phase Systems. In 1986, Carr joined Stellar Computer in Newton, MA as President. He was also a founder, vice-president and director of the Independent Data Communications Manufacturers Association (IDCMA) from 1971-1982. He had been a member of the Board of Directors of Interlan and joined the Board of Wellfleet in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr resisted the idea of sitting for an interview. When I argued that I had already interviewed others, rather than being persuaded, he said that was all the more reason it was not necessary to talk to him. But an interview of Carr was essential, as were interviews with the Presidents of Codex’s principal competitors: Paradyne (Robert Wiggins) and Racal-Milgo (Matt Kenney). Fortunately he finally agreed, subject to it being brief. So when I arrived at Stellar Computers in Newton, I was not sure how successful I would be. His secretary announced my arrival, and then asked that I have a seat. Soon thereafter, I was escorted into his office, where I was greeted coolly, yet politely. His sparsely appointed office reflected that of an entrepreneurial executive who was used to managing a tight cash flow. I set the tape recorder up and began. It went slowly until he remembered the date: it was the same day eighteen years ago when he learned that James Cryer, the President of Codex, and the man who had hired him, had unexpectedly died. Carr leaned back in his chair, reflected for a few moments, then buzzed his secretary and instructed her to clear his schedule, then turned back to me. I could not have asked for a more patient, and thorough, interviewee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Codex, Motorola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/10/102737982-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Art Carr Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/6/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bill-Carrico/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;William “Bill” Carrico graduated from Santa Clara University with a BSEE in 1972. Unable to find a job as an engineer, Carrico found a position in marketing with Fairchild Semiconductor. He spent seven years with Fairchild in various marketing and operational roles. During those years, he spent two as marketing director for Manny Fernandez, who would play is an important role in Carrico’s future, and was group executive vice president of Fairchild at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1979, Fernandez was recruited to join Zilog to replace Ralph Ungermann, who had been asked to leave.  Fernandez induced Carrico to come with him as his strategic planning manager. Carrico would convene two seminal strategic product-planning meetings in April and May of 1979 to focus Zilog’s product direction. The principal discussion centered on two topics: first, how to exploit Bruce Hunt’s Ariel local area networking technology – that became known as “the intelligent wire” – and second, the development of a minicomputer with the Z8000. Then in June, Bass resigned and joined Ungermann.  Bass was soon followed by many more engineers, some leaving to join what would become Ungermann-Bass, and others to what would become Excelan or the OmniNet LAN at Corvus. A year later, Bridge Communications was co-founded by Carrico and fellow Zilog colleague, Judy Estrin.  The Zilog meetings could well be described as the beginning of the Local Area Networking industry and the future NETWORKING market sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrico, soon afterwards, was named the Business Unit manager for the Systems Group and Estrin the engineering manager – a group that had been depleted of many of its key engineers. Carrico and Estrin transformed the Ariel project into the ZNet product over the next year and introduced the ZNet at National Computer Conference (NCC) in June 1980 in Anaheim. ZNet would be the first LAN to be introduced. Unfortunately, Exxon stopped funding the project, wanting to focus their efforts on developing a minicomputer to compete with IBM.  Exxon management neither understood LANs nor believed they would be major consumers of the semiconductors being developed by Zilog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentiments of Exxon management were then clear, and Estrin resigned in January 1981, joining Ungermann-Bass (U-B) one month later. Carrico, now without Estrin, yet believing in the future of local area networking, found it harder and harder to stay at Zilog. So when Estrin decided to leave U-B in May 1981, Carrico resigned from Zilog and they co-founded Bridge Communications (Bridge) in June 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrico and Estrin launched Bridge with their own money, but the more they thought through their initial strategy, essentially to build “bridges” to interconnect the growing number of different LANs running different protocols, they realized there weren’t enough installed LANs to build much of a company. So they expanded their strategy to encompass selling LAN controllers and terminal servers, which brought them into direct competition with U-B, and feelings that Estrin had betrayed her former friends and employer. Bridge had an immediate advantage in their completion with U-B for their products were built using the 16-bit Motorola 68000 microprocessor as well as the XNS protocol software. Bridge grew rapidly and went public in April 1986 with a valuation of $96 million. On September 30, 1987, Bridge merged with 3Com valuing the combination at $193 million. Carrico became President and COO of the new 3Com. The arrangement was not to last, however, and in June 1988 Carrico and Estrin resigned ostensibly to take an extended breather. But the entrepreneurs in them tugged too strongly, and before long, they joined Network Computing Devices to “jump-start” its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, conducted with Judy Estrin in their home in Los Altos, CA, Carrico discusses his time with Zilog and becoming interested in the systems business and then local area networking.  He then covers his time building Bridge, and the merger with 3Com.  In person, they were fun to be with, highly informative and knowledgeable, and careful to be sure that they had their facts straight.  They were still newlyweds and they displayed the joy of being with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Fairchild Semiconductor, Zilog, ZNet, Bridge Communications, Network Computing Devices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/03/102740285-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Carrico Interviewed by James Pelkey 6/23/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Vint-Cerf/",

S. in Mathematics, Vinton “Vint” Cerf, decided to pursue his interest in computers by going to work as a systems engineer for IBM in Los Angeles. In 1967, realizing he would benefit from more training, Cerf entered graduate school at UCLA. It was a fateful decision. For in 1968, Professor Leonard Kleinrock secured a contract from ARPA to build and run a Network Measurement Center (NMC) for the yet to be built Arpanet. Cerf and his friend, Steve Crocker, among others, were selected to build the operating system. Shortly after UCLA received the first IMP, in September 1969, Cerf was directed to help the two representatives from BBN: Robert Kahn and Dave Walden test the four-node network. Cerf and Kahn would form an important decades-long partnership. In addition to his work for the NMC, Cerf was a key member of the Network Working Group led by Steve Crocker, and a facilitator for the important ICCC demonstration. In 1972, after earning his PhD, he taught at Stanford (1972-1976). 1973 was a busy year as Cerf became Chairman of the International NWG, and was asked by Kahn to collaborate in designing a new Host-to-Host protocol that would support the interconnection of an arbitrary number of heterogeneous packet-switched networks. They published their results in May 1974 in a seminal paper that set forth the TCP protocol and Internet design. In September 1976, Cerf joined Kahn at the IPTO office of ARPA where he managed the re-design of TCP into TCP/IP. For personal reasons, as well as wanting to integrate a commercial email program and Internet, Cerf left ARPA for MCI (1982-1986) before rejoining Kahn once again as vice-president in the new not-for-profit corporation, Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), formed by Kahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 8, 1988 is a day I will remember forever. First, Paul Baran had set up two interviews that he said I would both enjoy and were crucial to reconstructing the history of the Arpanet. Then a man, who had become my surrogate Father, the now deceased William (Bill) Houser, Vice Adm. Ret., drove me out to the CNRI headquarters in Reston, VA. The fact that Bob Kahn had to reschedule proved to be fortunate, for it left me with more time to interview Vint Cerf. We sat in a public space, where we were observed by others and even joined by Dick Karp. Cerf was an easy interview for he gave clear answers that delved into the details without my having to ask follow up questions. He always gave credit to others and was gracious and engaging. It was easy to see why others liked to work with and for him. Then Bill excused himself; only to quickly return saying there was a blizzard outside, and we had better leave while we could. We quickly left hoping we would see each other again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: TCP/IP, INWG, ARPA, IPTO, CNRI, Robert Kahn,UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/11/102738017-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vint Cerf Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/8/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Wesley-Chu/",

In 1967, after earning his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford, he went to work at Bell Labs (AT&amp;amp;T), where he joined a group studying the technical issues of transmitting data over phone lines. The group discovered that terminals typically transmitted only 5% of the time that they were connected, leaving the lines idle for the remaining 95%. Given the high cost of communications at the time, because carriers charged a minimum fee for each connection, and the nature of computer communication was short bursts of data, the group focused their research on ways to transmit more data within a given connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Chu joined the faculty at UCLA in 1969, he continued his work on data transmission, investigating the concept of asynchronous time division multiplexing, which he later termed ‘statistical multiplexing’. This evolution of multiplexing solved the problem of what to do when connected terminals had no data to transmit, allowing terminals that did have data to transmit to take precedence. This type of control required significant processing power and memory. While Chu explored using early microprocessors to achieve this control, the development of Intel’s 8008 8-bit microprocessor in 1972 gave Chu the affordable processing power he needed to build a 64-terminal prototype. Chu filed for successful patents in ’76 and ’77 for his designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Chu describes his work at Bell Labs and UCLA as he developed his statistical multiplexer and its impact on the Data Communication industry. Ironically, as he was first building models to solve this problem, his colleagues working down the hall in Leonard Kleinrock’s lab were connecting the first Arpanet IMP and measuring data traffic to understand data flow on the subnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a number of engineers and entrepreneurs mentioned Chu’s name, and that he was doing research on multiplexing at UCLA, I soon found him and arranged for this interview. Chu was a very soft-spoken, individual, full of curiosity and enjoyable to talk to. Although his work did influence the developments of multiplexers in the industry, his influence was modest: it was an idea who’s time had come, and other engineers had similar ideas, developing their own versions of statistical multiplexers.  It was an example of cutting edge academic research that could have been financially rewarding for a university. The opportunity for royalties was never pursued by Chu or UCLA, and perhaps their claims may not have born much fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Statistical Multiplexing, Bell Labs, UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738737-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wesley Chu Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/18/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Dave-Clark/",

He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1973. When Clark became involved in the Internet protocol activities in the mid-1970’s, the organization was known first as the Arpanet Working Group, then as the Internet Working Group. Vint Cerf chaired these groups, and as a way to keep the number of people attending manageable, they changed the group names and never convened the group known by the prior name. In 1979, the name became even more obscure: the Internet Configuration Control Board, or the ICCB. In 1981 the name was changed again to the Internet Activities Board, or the IAB. That September, Clark became the acting chief architect of the Internet protocols as well as Chairmen of the IAB, replacing Cerf. In 1986, in a practice known as “sub-dividing,” the IAB created the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Clark tells of these convolutions and the logic behind them in this interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark explains that when DARPA learned that the computer scientists at MIT were not enthusiastic about using TCP/IP, they requested a meeting where Dave Reed presented his Data Stream Protocol (DSP). They also discussed the option of using Xerox PARC’s XNS. DARPA persuaded MIT personnel to both join the process of improving TCP/IP, and to investigate importing the token ring LAN developed at UC Irvine. MIT imported the token ring, only to find that re-engineering it turned out to be more than they had planned for, and would include multiple contracts to Proteon, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, when Clark began looking at the TCP/IP code with some of his students, they felt they could do a better job. So did others. To contest the complaints that TCP/IP was too big and messy, Clark coded a scaled down version to operate on a personal computer (PC). He proved his point and when others learned of his accomplishment they requested a version of his code; that leads to another fascinating set of stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the subject turns to how did he think IBM obtained the token ring technology from MIT, or did they get it from elsewhere? Professor Saltzer discusses this issue in his interview, as do Clark and Ken Pogran in theirs. This issue is one of the most important to understanding the history of local area networking, and of the evolution of the NETWORKING market sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first met Professor Clark at Proteon Board Meetings; he had been a member of the Board since 1984, whereas I began attending after the Montgomery investment in 1987. He wasn’t very vocal, but he obviously held the respect of Howard Salwen, the founder, and the other engineers who made presentations to the Board. Clark was not only a technical force, but created a link to other talent and resources at MIT. Knowing him from these board meetings helped create a sense of comradeship for this interview. There is no doubt he will have a long, successful career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Arpanet, Internet Working Group, ICCB, TCP/IP, DSP, Proteon Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738738-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dave Clark Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/7/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Wesley-Clark/",

He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1944 with a degree in physics. As a graduate student, he was furthering his studies at the reactor site at Hanford, WA when he came to the attention of scientists working for MIT Lincoln Laboratory. In 1952, they lured him away to work on the Whirlwind computer Project, the computer at the heart of the SAGE system and the responsibility of Jay Forrester. Whirlwind was the first computer designed to be “interactive;” very different than the prevailing “batch processing” mode of all previous computers. Interactivity required a very fast computer with input and output via a cathode ray tube display that gave nearly immediate visual response to the users’ commands. Clark, as a member of the Advanced Development Group at MIT Lincoln Labs, went on to design the MTC (Memory Test Computer), the TX-0, TX-2 and LINC computers, the latter considered the first personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950’s, the prevailing model of computing, where large mainframe computers operated in “batch” mode, began giving way to interactive computing. Clark, influenced by his experiences with single user computers, strongly favored the model of interactive computing that came to be known as personal computing; where each user operated a computer of increasing power and capability. In the late 1950’s, an alternative model of interactive computing emerged on the MIT Campus and at BBN, to become known as timesharing. Nevertheless, Clark steadfastly remained unconvinced, even if it meant alienating colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1960, MIT convened the Long Range Computation Study Group to decide the future of timesharing, even the role of computer studies, on the campus. The technical subcommittee recommended acquiring a large computer and converting it to timesharing. The result of the Study Group was the formation and funding of Project MAC in 1963. Clark and the chair of the subcommittee, Prof. Teager, refused to sign the Report. That may have been enough for Clark, for in 1964, he left MIT Lincoln Laboratory for a position at Washington University in St. Louis, MO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1967, ARPA held a Principal Investigators (PI) meeting at the University of Michigan to which Clark was invited. A central focus of that meeting was the issue of how to connect together different types of large mainframe computers running disparate operating systems. Larry Roberts, who had joined IPTO as the program manager reporting to Robert Taylor, favored having one mainframe in the center of the country to which all computers connected. It was not a perfect solution but it did solve the n-squared problem of connecting every computer to every other computer. At the end of the meeting, the idea struck Clark for a different solution to the problem. In a car ride back to the airport after the meeting, Clark suggested to Roberts, Taylor and Dave Evans the idea of connecting smaller computers together to form the network and connecting the larger computers to these smaller nodes. (It was an idea already tried, and working, in the NPL network.) After Roberts returned to Washington D.C., he soon came to see the merit in Clark’s suggestion, and thus was born the topology of the forthcoming Arpanet. The small computers came to be known as the IMPs, the Interface Message Processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Project Whirlwind; Forrester, Jay; TX-0 (Computer); TX-2 (Computer); LINC; MIT Lincoln Laboratory; Washington University; Michigan meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/11/102738606-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wes Clark Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/11/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Steve-Crocker/",

He grew up in Pasadena, CA and was a “high school buddy” with Vint Cerf; a friendship that continued through the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where they both earned their PhD’s in computer science albeit years apart. Crocker confesses he “limped through school” in contrast to the more disciplined Cerf. Nevertheless, Crocker possessed a rare degree of self-assuredness and was willing to make trade-offs to keep the focus of his education on his primary interests. For example, had he graduated on time, he would have earned his bachelor’s degree in 1965, but it took him until ‘68, in large measure because of his desire to explore the best program of study in Artificial Intelligence. Leaving UCLA before earning his degree, he took time to study at MIT in ’67. While at MIT, he asked Cerf, who was then in graduate school at UCLA, to find him a job in Los Angeles for the summer of 1968. Cerf connected him with Estrin, who Crocker had worked with as an undergraduate. It didn’t take Crocker long to decide to remain at UCLA to finish his degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ARPA held their Principal Investigators’ meeting in the spring of 1968, Crocker attended as a representative of MIT. Then in July, when Elmer Shapiro of SRI held the first meeting of the initial four sites to receive IMPs, Crocker attended as a representative of UCLA. Crocker and his fellow students relished the chance to connect with other bright minds in computer science. Another meeting of graduate students was suggested by Daniel Slotnick and took place later that year at the University of Illinois. Motivated to address the challenges they were facing, and partly, in Crocker’s words, as a “boondoggling mechanism”, Crocker and other students tasked with connecting their host computers to the first nodes of the Arpanet began meeting regularly at each of the four sites. The group became known as the Network Working Group (NWG) – one of the important informal structures of the Arpanet culture. Crocker and the group initially assumed their questions would be answered by superiors at ARPA and BBN, however such supervision rarely materialized. It was Crocker who realized the need to document these meetings and tasked himself with writing down the issues and proposals the group had discussed. Crocker’s first Request for Comment (RFC) was sent out on April 7, 1969. He continued to edit and distribute these important summaries of the group’s work until he accepted a position with ARPA in early 1970, at which time he handed over the editorship to fellow UCLA grad student, Jon Postel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Crocker’s Interview is lengthy as he discusses a number of valuable subjects in addition to his own very important role in the coming into being of the Arpanet. So if you are interested in the greater role of ARPA and its function, and not just the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO); the early history of computers at the UCLA; how NWG formed; the inception of the RFC; Crocker’s views on the importance of networking versus computer science; or, in general, the emerging culture of the early history of computer networking and Arpanet; reading this Interview will provide frank, fresh and fun insights.

As a graduate student at Stanford, he was a member of Vint Cerf’s team that published “Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program” in 1974, the first formal documentation of Cerf and Kahn’s design for TCP. He continued to stay active in the development of TCP/IP after receiving his PhD in Electrical Engineering. His first job after leaving Stanford was with Xerox PARC, where he worked on the 10 Mbps Ethernet Specification with DEC and Intel that led to the IEEE 802.3 LAN standard. Dalal also made important contributions to Xerox’s own internetworking protocol suite, XNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dalal, originally from India, came to Stanford in ’72, to pursue his PhD in Electrical Engineering. His interest in the subject of data communications led him to the office of Vint Cerf, who had recently joined the faculty as an assistant professor. Dalal’s eagerness and persistent pestering of Cerf to take him on as one of his research assistants finally paid off when Cerf made him an assistant in the summer of ’73. Cerf had just started working with Robert Kahn at BBN to develop a new internetworking protocol for the Arpanet, based on Louis Pouzin’s CYCLADES network. Dalal recalls early discussions with Cerf, Kahn and Robert Metcalfe that led to TCP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1977 Dalal went to work at Xerox PARC, where he researched their existing PUP networking protocol to inform the development of XNS. It was during this time that Dalal and colleagues John Shoch and David Boggs realized the coming importance of local area networking and the needs that an exponential increase in the number of LAN’s would require of internetworking protocols. To that end, they did what they could to convince Cerf and his team of the need for both a datagram and a session protocol. This led eventually to the splitting of TCP into TCP and IP protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dalal passed on Metcalfe’s offer to join him at his startup, 3Com, because Dalal felt like he still had work to do at PARC to help see XNS through to completion. Dalal eventually left Xerox in 1982 to join fellow PARC colleague David Liddle’s startup, Metaphor Computer Systems. They had both become frustrated with Xerox’s unwillingness to release upper levels of XNS. After leaving Metaphor, Dalal co-founded the Apple spinoff, Claris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend asked to walk me to Dalal’s cubicle at Claris, which was located at the far end the floor, with the other software developers. We reached Dalal’s office just as a meeting was breaking up. The camaraderie between Dalal and his team was immediately clear. I explained why I wanted to interview him and we briefly discussed people we knew in common. Once we began, Dalal spoke clearly and thoroughly, remembering fondly the stimulating work environments and amazing amount of talent at Stanford, PARC and the early startups of the day. He was an easy interview, and I could see why he had such an excellent reputation as a manger. By the time we ended, virtually everyone had left and he walked me over to my friend’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: TCP, TCP/IP, Xerox, Ethernet, PUP, XNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738752-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yogen Dalal Interviewed by James Pelkey 8/2/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bill-Dambrackas/",

As an engineer, he designed microprocessor-based statistical multiplexers for both Infotron and Milgo. His product designs in other areas included data encryption and network processing, before he co-founded his own networking firm, Equinox. Dambrackas began his career attending a 2-year technical school, after which he joined RCA as a junior engineer. In 1969, he was hired by Ultronic Systems, a subsidiary of GTE, as a design engineer. Ultronic’s main product was a stock market quotation system and one of the last products Dambrackas designed for Ultronic was a Motorola 6800 processor-controlled terminal for the display of stock quotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976 he was recruited away from Ultronic to join Infotron, where he was tasked with developing the company’s first microprocessor-controlled statistical multiplexer. Infotron introduced this statmux in early 1977. After the market for statmuxes was upended by Micom’s highly successful low-end Micro800 Data Concentrator introduced in January of ’78, Infotron responded with their own low-priced statmux in January of ‘79. Even though the Supermux SM480 sold for less and had more features than Micom’s statmux, Infotron was unsuccessful in capturing much of Micom’s market share, due in large measure to their choice of distribution channels; Micom had been extremely successful in selling through distributors, whereas Infotron chose to keep selling through sales reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June of ’79 Dambrackas was offered a position at Milgo to do just what he had done at Infotron – design a series of microprocessor-based statistical multiplexers. He made the move, knowing that Milgo was an industry leader in data communications and because he had always liked Florida. At Milgo, Dambrackas designed their Omnimux line of statmuxes to compete with Timeplex (on the high-end) and Micom (on the low-end). While at Milgo, he also designed data encryption and network management products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March of ’83, Dambrackas closed financing for his own company, Equinox, which he co-founded with Mark Cole, also from Milgo. In December 1983, Equinox introduced their DSS-1, a data PBX switching system capable of interconnecting 1,320 terminals and computer ports. Success came rapidly. In 1985, a financing led by Oak Investment Partners and DEC secured $3 million with a company valuation of $30 million. Equinox would be buffeted by market conditions and competition but would eventually become a public company in 1993. At the time of this interview the data PBX market was flattening out, but Dambrackas had been successful in duplicating Micom’s strategy of using distributors to sell a simple, low-end box product that anyone could install, doing in the data PBX market what Micom had done so successfully with in the statmux market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Ultronic Systems; Infotron; Milgo; Equinox; Statistical multiplexer; Micro800 Data Concentrator; Supermux SM480; Omnimux; Timeplex; Micom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/10/102740438-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Dambrackas Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/9/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/John-Davidson/",

During his graduate career he also served as the university’s liaison to the ARPANET Technical Working Group. After obtaining both his MS and PhD degrees from the University of Hawaii, he moved to Massachusetts in 1977 where he worked as Senior Computer Scientist at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). From BBN, Davidson was hired by Bass to work for Zilog, which he would subsequently leave in 1979 to work for the newly founded UB (Ungermann-Bass) Networks where he served as the Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Research and Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: ALOHAnet, Arpanet, Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Ungermann-Bass, Inc.

Davies played many key roles including influencing such important contributors to computer communications as Louis Pouzin, Hubert Zimmerman, as well as Roger A. Scantlebury, K.A. Bartlett, P.T. Wilkinson, Gary Farber and Derek Barber all associated with the NPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Davies shares in this interview, he had a long career with the NPL working with computers and solving communication problems. However, it was not until he attended the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Congress in NYC in 1965 that he becomes important to the history of computer communications and specifically with packet switching. Davies recalls that at the IFIP Conference: “everyone was talking about Project MAC at MIT, and timesharing was all in the news.” After leaving the Congress, he visited MIT and remembers having a number of conversations about the communication issues involved with timesharing. Then on arriving at Heathrow, he met a friend, Brian Shackel, who suggested Davies arrange a meeting at NPL with some of the MIT scientists to discuss Project MAC. The two-day seminar was held on November 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd of 1965. Larry Roberts was one of the people present. The conversations inspired Davies, later at home over his kitchen table, to sketch out the concepts that would become packet switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Davies met me at my hotel, he brought along a number of documents that made explicit his and the NPL’s efforts to made packet switching real. Davies first documented his thoughts in a memo dated November 10th,,1965. On the 15th of December he circulated a more “elaborate” paper. On March 16th, 1966, he gave a lecture at NPL to more than 100 people. After the lecture, Dr. A. Llewellyn, Director of the CAD Centre, offered to send him a copy of Paul Baran’s RAND report published in 1964. The contents of the lecture were later documented in a paper dated June 1966 (“Proposal for a digital communication network”); that contained the first use of the word “packet” - to distinguish between the message the user wanted to send and the smaller units used for transmission over the packet network - as well as introduced the concept of an “interface computer” to sit between the user equipment and the packet network. Although the Proposal met with surprising support, there was no organization like ARPA in the U.K. to create or fund such an experiment. When Davies was promoted to Superintendent of the NPL in August 1966, he now had the authority to initiate a pilot experiment within his lab to demonstrate the feasibility of a packet switch network. It was successful. Work then began to design what would become the NPL network - making it the world’s first operational packet switched network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: packet switching, NPL, IFIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/11/102738594-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Donald Davies Interviewed by James Pelkey 5/27/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/John-Day/",

No longer were the ARPA funded TCP/IP protocols the only networking protocols of choice for the future. It was thus essential to interview a number of knowledgeable “OSI” insiders to present a balanced history of events up through 1988. Thus, interested readers of these events will want to read not only this interview but also those with: Charles Bachman, Hubert Zimmerman, John Heafner, Jerry Mulvenna and James White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When John Day began working towards his MSEE at the University of Illinois in 1971, he also became involved with the Arpanet Network Working Group (NWG). He then began going to the INWG meetings in 1975. After receiving his MSc. in 1976, he joined the local firm, Digital Technology Inc., and continued his participation in international and national standards organizations. In 1978, Day became a leader in the evolution of the OSI standards. In 1982, he joined Charlie Bachman at Cullinane Database Systems in Westwood, MA. In 1984, when Bachman left to start a new company, Day decided to join Motorola, Inc./Codex Corp., where he continues to be employed. This interview reviews Day’s initial experiences with the Arpanet, his views of the history of networking protocols, early involvement with the creation of the OSI protocols and views on standards making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John suggested we meet at Codex’s headquarters to conduct his interview, since he was going to be there the day I requested. (I then learned that the engineers were located in the company’s other facility, not the luxurious “Farm.”) As I drove towards the stunning headquarters, I thought of the interview I had with John Pugh and hoped that this interview would be as helpful as that one had been. Soon I was standing before the receptionist and asking her to page John. As I heard his name over the intercom, I returned to a guest seat and occupied myself with guessing which man in the busy traffic of employees coming to greet their guests was John. I was wrong, but smiles and a firm handshake broke the ice between strangers. I rose and followed John to the equally grand cafeteria where we bought coffees and proceeded to find a quiet location for our conversation. While not nearly as long as Pugh’s interview had been, John soon informed me about the world of networking standards, and particularly of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols. He was, luckily for me, a perfect person to interview. So my education began, as did a relationship that I imagine I will always have. John had become an excellent writer and volunteered to serve as a valued editor and resource for my project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: OSI reference model, Arpanet, NWG, INWG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/11/102738592-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Day Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/11/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bob-Dolan/",

At the time, he was President of ComDesign, an early statistical multiplexer company that he founded in 1977. Prior to starting ComDesign, Bob had worked at Advanced Computer Communication (ACC). Bob had been involved with the University of California at Santa Barbara from the years 1974-1976, when as an employee of Speech Communications Research Laboratory, he was helping build the PDP interface for their Arpanet site. It was at that time that he met Rowland Bryant, who subsequently founded ACC, a DARPA subcontractor and the home of a number of start-ups in the Santa Barbara area, including ComDesign, Computer Machinery Corporation (CMC) and Digital Sound Corporation (DSC). Rowland, Bob, Larry Green (CMC), Jim McGill (DSC), and others met casually in a social network similar to those of Silicon Valley, Boston, Dallas and Los Angeles. When Bob started ComDesign, he intended to enter the local area networking business. But on seeing the opportunities in statistical multiplexing, and the success of Micom, he changed strategies and developed a series of statistical multiplexer products. His company tried to mimic Micom and recruited a number of people out of that company. In August 1986, Bob merged his company into Network Equipment Technologies, a leading T-1 multiplexer company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I decided to write a history of Computer Communications, I called Bob to ask him if he would sit for in interview. He readily agreed and recommended that I also interview Ken Krechmer. That interview was extremely valuable in aiding my understanding of the early dial-up modem business and identifying an initial list of people I should interview.

Donnan describes coordination across different IBM sites in Raleigh, North Carolina; La Gaude, France; Zurich, Switzerland; and elsewhere. He recalls the internal governance and structural changes within the IEEE 802 committee, as well as difficulties implementing committee standards in company products such as IBM’s SNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much reservation as I had to hearing IBM’s point-of-view on standards making in local area networking, I realized it was essential to the fabric of this history to get their perspective. Fortunately, Robert Donnan was not the expected “white-shirt” or “Big Blue is always right executive.” We had breakfast together that helped ease my concerns before we went to my room for the interview. Two questions I hoped to find answers to were: how and why did IBM select Token Ring as its local area networking technology, and the circumstances around IBM aligning itself with the token bus advocates in the IEEE 802 committee to thwart the momentum of Ethernet becoming the sole IEEE 802 standard? I was not as successful as I hoped I would be in finding answers to both questions, but neither had I failed. Donnan believed the commitment to Token Ring came from the Zurich Labs and the arrangement with token bus in IEEE 802 was short lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arranged a second interview with an IBM engineer/manager, Dan Warmenhoven, who was in Raleigh in 1980 and shares the complexity of product development within IBM, including Token Ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interested reader of the events of Ethernet and Token Ring should also read the &lt;a href=&quot;/int.05.md&quot;&gt;Gordon Bell&lt;/a&gt; interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: IBM, token ring, token bus, IEEE 802 committee, Systems Network Architecture (SNA),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/04/102738111-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Donnan Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/12/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/James-Dow/",

In the fall of 1980, he left Data General to start Microcom, with the idea to develop software to facilitate communications between microcomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow realized that in contrast to terminal-to-mainframe data communications, users of microcomputers wanted to transfer files such as spreadsheets, and for this type of data transfer error-correction was necessary to ensure that the files remained intact. To achieve this, Microcom developed the Microcom Networking Protocols (MNP) which were protocols for file transfer over dial-up modem connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Microcom’s MNP software ran on microcomputer operating systems and enabled users to transfer files using standard dial-up modems from other vendors. It soon became clear, however, that supporting the growing number of personal computer vendors was not cost effective. Another problem was that the software slowed down performance of the user’s CPU. Microcom’s response was to start selling their own modems and to include MNP in the modem itself. This innovation enabled Microcom to grab significant market share before other modem makers such as Vadic and UDS joined the market for protocol modems. MNP became a de facto standard after Microcom began licensing the protocols in ’83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Dow describes his early motivation for becoming an entrepreneur and the crucial role that Microcom’s innovation played in paving the way for successful product distribution, growth and early market success. Microcom was started as a software company, but eventually found itself in the PC modem market, just as the market began to take off. The story of that market, however, would be dominated by Hayes, U.S. Robotics, and Telebit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Data General, Microcom, Microcom Networking Protocols, protocol modem, dial-up modem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102792045-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James Dow Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/25/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Judy-Estrin/",

In her early career she helped develop some of the first networking and internetworking products and forged a path into this new market that many of the major computer and communications companies of the time failed to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estrin received her bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from UCLA and her master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford in ‘77.  As a student at Stanford, she worked under Vint Cerf during the testing and implementation of the TCP protocol for the Arpanet.  While at Stanford, she learned about early work on Ethernet technology in Robert Metcalfe’s class on distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving her master’s degree, Estrin went to work for Zilog, where she worked on chip architecture and computer systems.  Later, Estrin managed the development of Zilog’s networking technology, ZNet.  Estrin and future husband Bill Carrico ran the systems division that brought the concept of an “intelligent wire” from an early design idea, based on Bruce Hunt’s Ariel network, to the ZNet product that was introduced at the June 1980 National Computer Conference (NCC) in Anaheim.  Estrin stayed on at Zilog after many of her team left to join Ralph Ungermann and Charlie Bass in their new startup.  She eventually joined Ungermann-Bass as well, and was instrumental in finalizing an OEM deal with Xerox to develop an XNS compatible LAN product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensing that U-B had problems focusing their business, Estrin left U-B in ’81 to co-found Bridge Communications with Carrico.  Their focus was on networks and internetworking.  They designed their hardware using the newly developed Motorola 68000 16-bit microprocessor.  Drawing on her past experiences with ZNet, where her team had produced a winning technology, only to see it languish without the proper marketing channels, Estrin made sure they actively cultivated this emerging market.  She had successfully transitioned from engineer to savvy executive.  Bridge became a major player in the LAN and bridge market before merging with 3Com in ’87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, conducted together with Bill Carrico at their home in Los Altos, CA, Estrin describes her early work as a student, engineer, and later as a business leader.  She captures the excitement of the interaction between leading edge research and product development as well as the social networking that took place in the early days of Silicon Valley.  In person, they were fun to be with, highly informative and knowledgeable, and careful to be sure that they had their facts straight.  They were still newlyweds and they displayed the joy of being with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: UCLA, Stanford, TCP, Arpanet, Zilog, Z80, ZNet, Ungermann-Bass, Xerox, XNS, Bridge Communications, 3Com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/03/102740285-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Judy Estrin Interviewed by James Pelkey 6/23/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Roger-Evans/",

When ADS encountered financial problems, Case, led by Evans, came to the aid of ADS multiple times and, eventually, supported Bill Norred in his founding of Micom out of the bankruptcy of ADS. When Evans and Norred realized that for Micom to be successful, a full time marketing executive was needed, Evans left Case and joined Micom. It was his interactions with customers that led to the insight that the unique needs of minicomputer users was stimulating the growth of a new market niche for statistical multiplexers. In January 1978, Micom introduced their Micro800 Data Concentrator and in few years they became a public company and a leading Data Communication firm. But being a public company created pressure to grow, and in March 1985, Micom finally entered the Networking market by acquiring Interlan. In the spring of 1987, Evans succeeded Norred and became President of Micom. Before the end of the year, Evans led the purchase of the Internetworking company: Spectrum Digital. But 1988 would become a nightmare for Roger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had always admired Roger Evans as a marketing genus, but it was when I took the consulting assignment to run ComDesign from Bob Dolan in 1982 that my respect for the company Roger and Bill had built grew enormously. So you might imagine my heightened anticipation as I drove to Simi Valley to interview Roger. Only I lost my way. I arrived with less than 30 minutes left on the time Roger had made available for me. Graciously, he said he would stay later but that he did have a prior engagement and had to leave. His answers to the questions I asked took him back to an exciting time in his life. He took multiple telephone calls, saying that he would be home soon and he returned to our conversation. I recommend that any reader interested in how a company can escape the grips of defeat and become a very successful company read this interview. I will always find it stirring and shall ever be thankful to Roger for adjusting his schedule for this interview. I can still see his office with the shelves in the corner holding framed copies of Micom’s famous Orange Juice Can ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Case, ADS, Micom, Interlan, Spectrum Digital, Micro800 Data Concentrator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/09/102737975-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roger Evans Interviewed by James Pelkey 1/15/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/David-Farber/",

This interview begins the story of how token ring became an integral part of the University of California, Irvine (UCI)’s Distributed Computer System (DCS), before being transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with the assistance of DARPA before coming up against the mystery of how did IBM get the token ring technology and commit to it. But that is getting ahead of our story: so here is the interview of David J. “Dave” Farber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two of us slowly walked across the University Delaware campus to one of Dave’s favorite luncheon spots, and occupied an empty booth. As we continued to talk, I set my recorder up and we placed our orders. Dave had already told me that this was going to be his last term at Delaware before he intended to take a break from academic life to complete work on three computer networks he had conceived: CSNET, NSFNet, and the National Research and Education Network (NREN). Dave’s career had been a mixture of commercial and academic postings. After graduating from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1956, he worked for Bell Laboratories for 11 years where he helped design the world’s first electronic switching system (ESS-1) and the SNOBOL programming languages. He next joined RAND Corporation in Southern California where he was “heavily involved with, and affected” by, Paul Baran’s work. Next he spent a year and a half working at Scientific Data Systems (SDS), while simultaneously teaching in the evenings at UCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late ’69, convinced that Xerox was “wrecking” SDS, Farber took an Acting Associate Professor position at UCI. Lacking a Ph.D., he was given two years “ to come up with a project, get it funded, and get enough published on it, enough work done, so he could go up for a permanent position.” Intrigued with the advent of minicomputers, Farber settled on a design to build a totally decentralized computer system of three minicomputers interconnected with a token ring local area network: it was to become the DCS. He submitted a funding proposal to the NSF in 1970 for $250,000 a year. It was funded. Then in 1973, Farber presented a paper on the DCS system that stimulated curiosity, not only about the distributed system, but also the token ring local area network. So in 1975, when the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) of MIT became interested in finding a LAN technology they could use, DARPA directed them to Farber at UCI. After a visit from LCS’s Ken Pogran, the decision was made. MIT imported the token ring from UCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Bell Labs, Rand Corporation, UCI, DCS, NSF, token ring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/09/102740206-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dave Farber Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/8/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bill-Farr/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;William (Bill) Farr joined the minicomputer company Prime Computer in 1972, the year it was founded, after working as an engineer at Computer Control Company and DEC. He was a lead engineer at Prime in 1975 when the co-founder and vice president of engineering, Bill Poduska, gave him some papers on the ALOHAnet and asked him to start thinking about networking. (Poduska would go on to found Apollo Computer in 1980, known for its high-performance networked engineering workstations.) Farr describes Poduska’s style of management as similar to that of DEC’s founder, Ken Olsen, and to some extent, of Gordon Bell; all three leaders made a point to connect with members of the engineering staff on a daily basis and were superb in their ability to inspire innovation and creativity. Farr soon began reading anything he could about networking, including Robert Metcalfe’s PhD thesis on Ethernet, and papers from Bell Labs on its early ring network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fall of ’76, Farr and other engineers at Prime had built a 3-node token passing network, and by early ’77 they had installed a 16-node network in the engineering department. Functional, but not yet a commercial product, PrimeNet, as it was known, was used internally to share files and storage drives without having to physically move disk packs back and forth. It soon became a critical part of the engineering department’s production process. Even so, Farr could not get marketing interested in selling it, nor could he get support from management to finance a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late ’77, Prime started using the network adapters to replace an earlier parallel interface connection developed by Paul Severino, which was only meant for short distances. Finally convinced of the importance of networking to sales, management decided to include the token ring adapter boards in many of their computers. Announced in ’79, Prime’s Ringnet provided networking hardware and software for their minicomputers and helped them land contracts with major companies, including Ford Motor Company. Ford became one of Prime’s largest customers and by the time of this interview, had a network of 180 nodes. Initially Ringnet used X.25 protocols, but eventually they supported other protocols and networking architectures such as Ethernet. In 1982 Farr presented a study on the performance of Ringnet at The Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, where representatives from Xerox PARC presented the results of performance tests on Ethernet. Interestingly, the results showed that they both performed similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Farr discusses the early success he achieved with other Prime engineers in developing the internal network at Prime. He describes the common experience of many innovators working within existing companies who are unable to get the support of management to develop their innovation into new products. Farr states that Prime’s competitor DEC learned about Prime’s network early on and, in his opinion, this knowledge helped motivate DEC to develop their own networking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Prime Computer, token passing, PrimeNet, Ringnet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/02/102792021-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Farr Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/7/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Manny-Fernandez/",

Fernandez guided the company during the development of their LAN product, ZNet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez earned his bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from the University of Florida in 1967. After working as an engineer at ITT and Harris Corporation, he eventually moved to Fairchild Semiconductor, where he became Group Executive Vice President. Fernandez came to Zilog in ’77. The company had just introduced its Z80 processor, but sales were less than $5 million. By the time he left in ’81, Zilog’s sales were over $100 million, based largely on the success of the Z80, but also on the many peripheral chipsets developed by Zilog. For example, the Macintosh SE, although it used the Motorola 68000 processor, contained several peripheral chip sets from Zilog. As Fernandez states, “Actually, there are probably more dollars of Zilog parts inside a Mac [SE] than there are of Motorola’s”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Fernandez gives additional insights on the emerging LAN industry, one that Zilog was pursuing during his time as president, but one that he chose not to focus on. Their main focus was semiconductors and Fernandez saw the two markets of components and systems working together to help Zilog sell more chips. The third market, the emerging networking market, did not create the same demand for semiconductors. In his words, “it was a third leg of a stool that was kind of dangling.” Fernandez offers an executive’s overview of the microprocessor industry at a time when the LAN industry was just beginning, revealing insights as to why many of the larger computer companies were slow to get in on the networking market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manny and I met each other when he was president of Gavilan Computers and I was president of Sorcim. At that time we negotiated a contract that would have a number of Sorcim products bundled in the Gavilan computer. When we met for this interview we had both moved on to new positions. Manny was president of Dataquest and it was there that this interview was held. The Dataquest market research was the very best for understanding the three market sectors covered in this book. Our knowing each other made this interview very comfortable and Manny was very forthcoming with his understanding of these markets. After the interview he let me spend time in their library to make copies of their reports and data that I needed, which was very helpful to grounding this book in real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Zilog, ZNet, Z80, Z8000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/03/102740308-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manny Fernandez Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/7/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Robbie-Forkish/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;Robbie Forkish was a software engineering manager for Tymnet from 1978 to 1982. Forkish was instrumental in developing Tymnet’s networking software for its public data network. The network was initially designed to service users connecting terminals to hosts, but in the early ‘80s, Tymnet began to offer customers their own private networks. As Tymnet began designing and supporting larger networks, Forkish began to investigate distributed networking architectures. He was also intrigued with the challenge of combining voice and data services over private networks, and in 1982, Forkish joined Bell Northern Research (BNR) in their Mountainview lab. At BNR he managed a team of software developers working on ‘packetizing’ voice transmission. At the time, Forkish believed, as did many in the emerging networking industry, that the PBX was going to offer a competitive alternative to local area networking solutions like Ethernet and token ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was while he was at BNR that former co-workers from Tymnet, Audrey Maclean, Roger Chrisman and Sarah Schlinger, met with him to convince him to jump ship and join their ‘crazy startup’ as Forkish remembers referring to their company at the time. Maclean knew that Forkish had the experience they needed to develop software for distributed voice and data networks. Although Forkish was happy with his job at BNR, after discussing the opportunity with his wife and confident that his former co-workers would be able to raise the capital they needed, he decided to make the jump. He joined the team in February 1983, well before they received their first round of funding in August. In May they incorporated Network Equipment Technologies (NET) and began to develop their initial product, a T1 networking switch that could handle multiple T1 lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the six months between the time he started at NET and the time they received their financing and could hire a team of developers, Forkish produced a 50 page document outlining the architecture and functionality of the networking application. After bringing on the software team, many of whom Forkish had worked with at BNR and Tymnet, they hit the ground running, and within 6 months, they were close to completion. For Forkish, “it was one of the most satisfying efforts I’ve been involved in.” Product development involved close collaboration between the software team, led by Forkish and hardware development, led by Chrisman. In addition, co-founder Walt Gill, a former chief engineer at Avantek, provided essential understanding of common carrier transmission requirements. This thorough product planning proved essential to the reliability and power of the product. Introduced in January of ’85, NET’s IDNX T1 switch was an immediate success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Forkish describes the detailed planning and development that went into NET’s first product and the impact it had on the industry.

Already available are the related histories of Art Carr, CEO, and John Pugh, Director of Marketing. Now comes the interview with the VP of Research, Dave Forney. To complete the critical early history requires the interview of Jerry Holsinger, the inventor of the 9600 bps modem, the product that once perfected under Forney’s leadership becomes the source of Codex’s unassailable decades long success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forney graduated from Princeton with his B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering in 1961. He next received his M.S. and Sc.D. degrees from M.I.T. in the years 1963 and 1965. While at MIT, Forney worked at Lincoln Labs as a Staff Associate. On graduating from MIT, he went to work for Codex as a Member of the Technical Staff. The events of 1970 were transformative not only for Codex, but also for Forney, who became the VP of Research and member of the Board of Directors. In 1975, he was promoted to VP of Research and Development, a position he held until 1979. After Motorola’s acquisition of Codex in 1977, Forney was promoted to an ISG (Information System Group) position before returning to Codex as a Motorola VP in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviewing Dave proved to be much easier and more demanding than I had expected. Easier because he was a true gentleman and never asserted his superior intelligence, as any reader of this interview will discover. What might not come across is just how “on my toes” I labored to be. For as I entered his office with bookshelves crammed with books and stacks of professional Journals filled with articles I would never be able to read, much less understand, I knew I was about to interview a man of truly superior intelligence. Luckily for me, Dave never reveled in his advantages that strangely made it all the more intense for me. Fortunately, however, Dave did not assert his right to cut the interview short, and patiently and thoroughly answered all my questions. As I left his office, he graciously escorted me out, and I felt I had learned what I needed to know to write the history of Codex, a history collaborated by Carr, Pugh and Holsinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, Codex, 9600-bps modem, AE-96, Modem-X, L Series Modem, Motorola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/04/102738110-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Forney Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/28/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Howard-Frank/",

His thesis was built on “statistical communication type theory, sort of an extension of Von Neumann work.” He then accepted an appointment as assistant professor in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Where he expected to make a “career.” At Berkeley he came across an article in the Journal of Mathematical Biophysics that allowed him to reproduce the thousands of hours of computer simulation done by Paul Baran on a single page of formulas. The article, “Vulnerability of Communication Networks,” was published in the IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology in December 1967. It attracted immediate attention and Frank was invited to give a talk at the Institute for Defense Analysis in Washington. That led to his joining the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) in 1968 and undertaking a project for the Federal Power Commission that Frank describes as “essentially the beginnings of all the topological design of computing networks.” After a very successful eleven months with the OEP, Frank left to help launch a start-up: Network Analysis Corporation (NAC). He soon renewed his relationship with Larry Roberts who was struggling, in his spare time, to optimize the telephone connections between the first four nodes of Arpanet and expansion to sites on the East Coast. It was a problem ideally suited for the skills Frank had mastered. A first small contract let in October 1969 led to a “crash effort” and successful deliverables in February 1970. Frank would then join his friend Leonard Kleinrock in supporting Roberts, and then Robert Kahn, in architecting the build-out of the future Arpanet. He also served on the packet-radio working group. But serving as the principal investigator for the ARPA contract through 1977 was only a part of Frank’s career. In 1970, Frank assumed the leadership of NAC, then sold NAC to Contel Corporation in July 1980, He left Contel in April 1985, formed a new systems integration company focused on network management in February 1986: Network Management Incorporated,. To complete his journey as of 1988, Frank joined the Board of Directors of Contel April 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Dr. Frank to understand how he came to be one of the central consultants to the early history of the IPTO office and the Arpanet. By the end of our few hours together, I had learned more than I had ever imagined about the early history of computer communications. This interview is one of the essential reads for anyone interested in this history. Frank gave generously of his time and insights and informed my writings. It is no wonder that his achievements were not over as of May 1988.

Before joining Micom, Frankel worked for IBM, Hughes Aircraft and Tran Telecommunications. At Tran, he and another engineer built an early version of a data PBX. Later at Tran, he helped design and build multiplexers for the Canadian Government’s “Dataroute”, the first data communications service. He was also involved in the design of a X-25 compliant circuit/packet network for the South African Post Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first task at Micom was to build an engineering team. When Frankel joined Micom, he remembers, “engineering was Bill Norred and one very capable programmer and a couple of helpers and that was it.” Their only products were a statistical multiplexer and some TDMs. Frankel managed the development of new products in the statistical multiplexer line, as well as the introduction of the Micro600 Port Selector and other data PBX products, and development of a line of modems. Frankel saw the company grow to over 2,000 employees with an increase in revenues from $5 to $133 million during the 5 years he was with them, helping to establish Micom as one of the industry leaders in the data communications market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankel left Micom in 1984 for network storage company Emulex. He saw the threat that the introduction of the PC presented to the data PBX industry and thought that Micom was in need of an organizational restructuring. He and Micom co-founder, Roger Evans, had learned from Micom’s customers that with the advent of desktop computers, they wanted to transfer files, something that the emerging LAN technology did better than data PBX’s. As Micom realized they needed a systems-based solution, not just a hardware solution, to compete in the new LAN market, they went looking for a LAN company to acquire. But Frankel had seen the writing on the wall and mindful of the value of his investment in Micom at the time, left before the deal was finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I helped recruit Steve to become the COO of Retix, an OSI firm, which he joined soon after this interview in September of ‘88. I had been involved with Retix since 1987, when Montgomery made an initial investment and I joined their board. The interview took place at his home in Rancho Palos Verdes.

His first job was to update the company’s programmable instrumentation interface so that Tektronix products conformed to the same interface used by rival, Hewlett-Packard. The HP interface was developed by Don Loughry and had been standardized by the IEEE 488 committee in ‘75. Graube organized Tektronix’s transition to the new 488 standard and contributed additional protocols to the standard through his work with the 488 committee, where he met Loughry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graube thought the 488 interface could be improved and applied to a wider range of products, so he started exploring other developments in the field of computerized control networks. In ’77 he began attending the Industrial Process Control Workshop at Purdue University, where members were developing a standard for a ‘data highway,’ an early application of local area networking. Graube eventually became chairman of the group, which changed its name to Process Control Data Highway (PROWAY). ANSI adopted the PROWAY standard for process control, but Graube again saw the potential for wider application of a general data transmission standard. Graube’s enlisted help from his friend Bob Stuart, who had initiated standards for microprocessors in IEEE, and who suggested that Graube propose a new IEEE standards group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving approval from IEEE for committee 802, Graube led its first meeting at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco in late February 1980. Graube’s initial goal was to architect an agreement on a single standard for local computer networks. In his mind a single standard, even if it didn’t cover all areas of the industry, would encourage development of semiconductor chips for networking, decreasing the cost and encouraging new applications of the technology. The path to agreement was complex, requiring Graube, along with the help of Robert Rosenthal of NBS, to navigate a minefield of technical and political challenges. At one point, facing gridlock in their meetings and criticism from the media, they made the decision to completely re-organize the group’s structure and voting protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another concession to the fiercely divided parties involved, Graube was forced to abandon his goal of one standard. The 802 committee eventually succeeded in standardizing three of the main networking technologies of the day; Ethernet, token bus, and token ring. To achieve these goals, Graube enlisted others with experience in standardization, including Don Loughry, whom he recruited for his experience in the 488 committee to chair the CSMA/CD subcommittee, and Robert Donnan, who chaired the subcommittee on token ring. Graube’s work leading the group was incredibly challenging, as he says in the interview: “I’d toss and turn at night and go to these meetings like going off to wars.” Throughout the process, he was able to manage personal egos, corporate power plays, and political agendas in one of the most storied histories of standards-making. Graube continued to work with the 802 committee until he left Tektronix in ’85 to start his own network consulting business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102792042-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maris Graube Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/12/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/George-Grumbles/",

His introduction to the fast moving world of electronics began when he found a job working as a manufacturing representative. In 1968 he moved to the Boston area when offered the position of Vice-President of Marketing and Sales of Control Logic, a company building digital controls. After five years, a friend told him about an opening with Universal Data Systems (UDS). Knowing some of the people involved with UDS and wanting to move back to Huntsville, it was an easy decision. So in 1972, he accepted the position of Vice-President of Marketing and Sales of UDS reporting to Mark Smith the President and founder (See Mark Smith Interview).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers interested in the first decades of the dial-up modem market, this Interview gives a great overview; of the evolution from over 100 companies, and maybe as many as 160 companies, to a handful of companies led by UDS and Vadic; all combining to create a market thought to be as large as $500M. It will become clearer in the reading of the five Interviews of the key individuals within UDS and Vadic, how those two companies became dominant and also different from each other; for example, they both started out as OEM companies, yet they chose to focus on different “niche” markets, such as Vadic’s on timesharing, versus UDS’s on “point of sale.” One of the most significant events in the market evolution was the innovation of the 1200 bps modem. Vadic gained the early market leadership with their VA3400, only to let a design “oversight” give AT&amp;amp;T an opening with their Bell-212 or UDS with their 1212. Not wanting to concede a technological advantage to UDS, Vadic sued UDS for patent infringement. Vadic lost the suit but for reasons unrelated to the technology, effectively giving UDS the claim they sought, i.e. that they were as innovative as Vadic or AT&amp;amp;T. In December 1980, UDS sold themselves to Motorola for reasons almost identical to Vadic’s sale to Racal two years earlier. When Mark Smith retired in 1986, Grumbles became President of UDS and Vice-President of Motorola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reader will also find network interactions between the dial-up sector of the modem market and the leased-lined sector through the actions of Vadic and UDS to win an OEM contract with Codex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: UDS, Vadic, Codex, semiconductors, IPO markets, Motorola, Racal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/10/102738571-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;George Grumbles Interviewed by James Pelkey 11/28/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/John-Heafner/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;Software engineer John Heafner gained his first experience in networking while at RAND, where he worked on connecting one of the first nodes to the Arpanet in early 1970. For this project Heafner contributed to programming the interface between RAND’s IBM 360 and their Interface Message Processor (IMP). As a member of Steve Crocker’s Network Working Group, Heafner also helped in the planning of the Arpanet Network Control Program (NCP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At RAND, Heafner worked under Keith Uncapher, and in 1972, when Uncapher left RAND to form the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at USC, Heafner followed to work with Uncapher and to pursue his PhD. After earning his PhD from USC, he briefly joined the faculty at Virginia Tech before taking a position at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) managing the System and Network Architecture Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first month with NBS Heafner attended meetings sponsored by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) on Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) networking standards then in development through the International Standards Organization (ISO). NBS eventually joined the efforts of the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and ISO to formalize the OSI standards. The NBS agenda became, in Heafner’s words: ‘to sanitize the Department of Defense protocols through ISO’ in order to formalize the Federal Information Procurement Standard (FIPS) for local area networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, ’83 Heafner helped to organize the first NBS sponsored OSI implementors workshop in Boston, which led to the first public OSI demonstration at the June ’84 National Computer Conference in Las Vegas. This demonstration was a collective effort by NBS and marketing executives from vendors in the manufacturing and office automation industry to promote the use of OSI compliant products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December ’86, NBS organized the first Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) committee to create a standard OSI configuration so that US governments agencies, as well as other foreign governments, could ensure compliance and interoperability. This eventually led to the publication of the first version of GOSIP in August of ’88 and its adoption as a FIPS in February 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview Heafner describes the efforts of NBS to promote the adoption of OSI standards in cooperation with many industry representatives.

It began in 1950, when as a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he was assigned to work on the famous Whirlwind computer project. When that project was transferred to MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1953, Heart transferred with it. He would then spent the next 15 years working on the seminal SAGE air defense system and many other projects connecting computers to real-time data collection systems. In addition to the unique and invaluable experience and knowledge he gained during his years at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, he worked with a group of noteworthy scientists and engineers, including Wes Clark, Larry Roberts, Ivan Sutherland, Will Crowther, Severo Ornstein and Dave Walden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1966, Heart attended an Academy of Sciences sponsored workshop at Woods Hole, MA. Over the summer, he became good friends with Danny Barbaro who worked at BBN. Barbaro would tell Heart about a large ‘hospital project’ BBN had with the Massachusetts General Hospital. It reminded Heart of his desire to work in life sciences, an opportunity he did not have at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. So when Barbaro returned to BBN, and learned the project manager had left, and that BBN had no senior person to take over the project, he convinced management to recruit Heart. It was a difficult decision for Heart, but in the end he agreed, joining BBN in December 1966. Indicative of his leadership style and skill, Will Crowther, Dave Walden and Severo Ornstein all chose on their own to follow him from Lincoln Laboratory to BBN. Ironically, when he arrived at BBN, he was given the responsibility of shutting down the project he had hoped to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart needed not to worry, as fortune would soon shine on him. In March 1967, when Taylor and Roberts were asking others who might be best to manage the Arpanet project, Wesley Clark told them “there isn’t anybody else; if you want this job done, you go to Frank Heart”. Beginning in early 1968, before the RFP had been issued, Heart worked on monitoring the forthcoming Arpanet project for BBN. When the RFP was finally issued, in August of 1968, BBN assigned Heart the responsibility of assembling a team and preparing their response. BBN eventually won the contract and Heart managed the project, delivering it on time and under budget. Heart continued to supervise the operation and maintenance of the Arpanet project throughout his time at BBN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, Whirlwind, Lincoln Laboratory, SAGE, Bolt Beranek &amp;amp; Newman (BBN)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/12/102738689-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frank Heart Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/11/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Jay-Hill/",

In 1969, he joined the start-up Inforex and rose from a branch manager to director of marketing and of international distributors. In 1976, he left to become Vive-President of Marketing and Sales for Paradyne. By the time he resigned form Paradyne in 1980, Hill had introduced a level of sales management to data communications that would have a lasting imprint on the industry and help transform Paradyne into a feared competitor and public company. He then left technology for a few years before returning to be Senior Vice-President of Sales and Marketing for Doelz Networks (1984-1987), a manufacturer of ATM communications equipment. He left Doelz Networks to join Harris Corporation, Digital Telephone Systems Division as Corporate Vice President and Division General Manager. After a year, he next joined Cortex (1988- ) as Executive Vice President. Cortex was a provider of computer aided programming software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first met Jay at my initial Doelz Networks Board meeting; I was attending not as a member but as an observer. When it came time for the Marketing and Sales report, Jay joined the meeting. He was the most immaculately dressed executive I had ever seen at a venture capital backed company. He then made a presentation that reflected a professionalism learned at IBM and refined under the discipline of Bob Wiggins, the President of Paradyne. It was exemplary. After the meeting I asked Jay to have dinner with me. It became a ritual, and Frank Connors, the President of the company, would often join us. I learned much in those discussions. Jay and I became close friends and hence the pleasure of doing this interview, one that captures the changing dynamics of the leased-line market.

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;Sometimes innovation relies more on the inspiration and motivation of an individual than on teams of employees. Such was the case of innovating the 9600 bits/sec. modem. As early as 1955-56, AT&amp;amp;T, and Bell Labs, knew that a modem of such speeds was possible. But Bell Labs, the paramount telephony communications research organization, had only been able to develop a 2400 bits/sec. modem. Why? Holsinger opines in this interview. As successful as the Codex AE-96 was, only when they introduced their second generation 9600, the L Series, developed under the team led by David Forney, had they innovated a truly robust modem: the L Series set Codex on the path of market leadership. Holsinger’s self-description as an entrepreneur, however, proved prescient for he founded a very successful modem firm, Intertel, after leaving Codex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of this interview, Jerry Holsinger had been retired for several years as Chairman and CEO of Infinet, formerly Intertel, which he had founded in 1970. Holsinger received his doctorate from MIT in 1965, and then started to develop a high-speed modem at Defense Research Corp. in Santa Barbara, CA. After having created a working prototype, Holsinger formed a company, Teldata, and tried to raise venture capital. Realizing he was not going to be successful, he turned to his only option and sold his company to Codex Corp. in 1967. As an employee, he developed the world’s first 9600 b/s modem: the AE-96. He left Codex in 1969, and founded Intertel in the following year. Intertel started out with low-speed modems, then higher-speed, and was well known for pioneering in network management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry and I had difficulties finding a time when we were both in the Boston area and settled on having a late dinner in my hotel room in Westborough, Ma. So once we met in my room and ordered room service, we talked, ate quickly and started the interview around 9 PM. Jerry was very patient for my endless questions, and I think you will find some of his answers a little brief because of the time of day and both our needs to complete the interview. What is not captured is the time we took afterwards, to laugh at our situation and his hoping he had been of help. Which he had been, of course, particularly of the time after he left Codex and faced the issues of starting a company that would end up going public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, 9600-bps, Modems, Defense Research Corp., Teldata, Codex Corporation, Intertel, Infinet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/04/102738129-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jerry Holsinger Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/6/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Craig-Huffaker/",

At that time, DCA was five years old, with annual sales of around $1 million. The company’s first products were front-end processors, mainly for DEC computers, but in 1980, they started shipping a microprocessor based statistical multiplexer, competing with Micom, Timeplex &amp;amp; Infotron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huffaker describes DCA’s growth throughout the late ‘70s and as they struggled to cover expenses, initially without investment capital. By maintaining a close relationship with their bank (Bank South of Atlanta), DCA was able to survive its early years with bank loans. When the need for capital became unavoidable, as DCA wanted to grow their new statmux product line, they hired Bertil (Bert) Nordin to take on the role of CEO as part of a $3.5 million funding, which closed in January of ’81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DCA capitalized on the fast growth of the data communications market in ’81 and ’82 and went public in February of ’83. In the summer of ’83 DCA acquired Technical Analysis Corporation (TCA), a company that had just developed a board that enabled a personal computer to emulate the functions of an IBM mainframe computer terminal. Called the IRMA board, the product became a runaway success for DCA and created a significant revenue stream throughout the ‘80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other significant DCA acquisitions were Microstuf and Forte Communications, suppliers of competing IBM terminal emulators, and Cohesive Network, a major competitor in the T1 multiplexing market acquired in September of ’86 for $28 million. In August of 1987, DCA next acquired Fox Research and its 10Net LAN product and incorporated the company as an independent subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the main financial executive in the company, Huffaker was instrumental in making DCA’s many acquisitions throughout the ‘80s. Craig was one of the few interviews I did after 1988. In this case, I was interested in his perspective on the attempt DCA made to acquire NET. After initial discussions with NET, DCA decided that their asking price of $200 million was too high and acquired NET’s competitor Cohesive instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Digital Communications Associates (DCA), Technical Analysis Corporation, Microstuf, Forte Communications, Cohesive Network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/04/102738129-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Craig Huffaker Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/9/92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bruce-Hunt/",

His reaction was immediate. For months afterwards, he was consumed with working out Metcalfe’s ideas for himself. During this exploration, a friend told him about Zilog, an exciting start-up, that was hiring. His skills and experiences matched their needs. Soon, Hunt had the freedom to further develop his entry-level LAN technology he named “Ariel.” Only Zilog had too many senior people already committed to the Ethernet technology to consider Ariel. Hunt left Zilog in September 1978 to further his education at Stanford University. One of his professors, Fouad A. Tobagi, whom he had met at a Zilog gathering, encouraged his interests. Together they wrote a paper on CSMA/CD that they presented at the seminal Local Area Communications Network Symposium in May 1979. After Stanford, Hunt worked at SRI International before launching Metapath. With Norman Dion’s investment made in March 1983, Hunt was able to hire the needed personnel to sufficiently develop their product for presentation to venture capitalist investors. The story of Metapath demonstrates the profusion of new technologies and start-ups characteristic of a new market, and the consolidation inevitably forced by a dominant design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend, Robert “Bob” Duggan, asked me to visit a “garage shop” start-up that he was interested in investing in. At the time, Bruce Hunt and a couple of engineers and a few consultants rented a few rooms in downtown Menlo Park. The meeting went well, so I started spending time with the team, conducting due diligence and trying to be of help. Bob then made an ‘Angel” investment and Bruce incorporated “Hunt 4th” and finished the first draft of a business plan. Before long, he was invited to make a presentation to Norman “Norm” Dion, the founder of the successful company, Dysan, and a substantial Angel investor.

On his staff was an engineer, Bill Pugh, who established that a suitable goal would be 10,000 bits per second in a voice band. In 1955, 56, they proposed such a goal in the GOR that became the research document for AFCS to provide an integrated worldwide communications system for the Air Force. Later, Johnson was assigned to the White House doing policy work on satellite activities. In 1968, Johnson was promoted to Brigadier General and moved to Hawaii were he was Commanding General of the Air Force Communication Center in the Pacific. He then decided to retire and go to work for the Western Union Telegraph Company as Assistant Vice-President of Government Systems located in Washington D.C. He was promoted to Vice-President and later Group Vice-President, almost all that time working on their Westar satellite system until it was launched in 1974. Next, Johnson became Vice-President of Marketing after Western Union decided they couldn’t afford the group-organizational structure. He left Western Union at the end of 1976. In 1977, Johnson joined Fairchild Industries as Vice-President of Marketing with their internal start-up American Satellite. In September 1980 he was recruited to be a founder of Vitalink Communications, to provide private satellite communications, where he stayed until late1983. In January 1984, Paul Baran and Steve Millard, the co-founders of Telebit, recruited Johnson to be President of their start-up. He served as President until he returned to Fairchild Industries in 1988. Later, Johnson helped create the first Venture Capital fund in Israel and contributed to the birth of Israel as the “Start-Up Nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first met General Johnny Johnson in the fall of 1984 when Telebit was circulating an Investment Memorandum. It would be one of the first investments my team and I made with the venture capital funds of Montgomery Securities.

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;James “Jim” Jordan held two important positions in the emerging Computer Communications Market. The first was with Ungermann-Bass, where as vice-president of sales and marketing, he was responsible for selling local area networking products when there was barely a market for them. Next he took on the challenge of selling non-standard, high-speed modems when he became president of Telebit in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Business and Marketing from University of Utah. He then joined IBM where he held a succession of sales and marketing positions until he left to join Four-Phase Corp. in 1970. When he left Four-Phase, ten years later, he had risen to Vice-President of Sales and Marketing, responsible for 700 people and revenues of nearly $200 Million. As challenging as that was, he remembers himself as being “bored.” So when Ralph Ungermann approached him for a similar role at Ungermann-Bass (U-B), where he would have no direct reports in a company of basically 14 engineers, and had yet to raise any venture capital, he deliberated, but not for long, before he said “Yes.” Why? Because for the last year his sales force at Four-Phase had come into competition with Datapoint Corporation, which was selling a rudimentary local area network called ARC (Attached Resource Computer), later to be known as ARCnet. Jordan’s attempts to convince management of the need to offer networking services fell on deaf ears and he was eager to get involved in this new industry. Once Jordan was aboard at U-B and had helped to complete the business plan, $1.5 Million of venture capital was raised within 60 days. Ungermann pays Jordan an ultimate compliment in his interview when he says that for 6 years Jordan never missed a sales forecast. In 1983, Jordan and Charlie Bass were both promoted to Executive Vice-Presidents. His growing differences with Ungermann over how the company was run caused Jordan to resign in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1986, Jordan became President and Chief Executive Officer of Telebit, a high-speed modem start-up founded by Paul Baran. Two years later, Jordan recruited Lewis Elmore to replace him as president and CEO and he became chairman of the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview was held in Jordan’s office at Telebit. We had become friends over the previous two years for I was a working Board member for Telebit. In this interview, Jordan gives a very thorough description of the differences in the corporate cultures of his past positions and the one he faced with Ungermann-Bass. Unfortunately we ran out of time and so I was not able to ask him additional questions about his experience at Telebit. He is a very talented chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Four-Phase; Ungermann-Bass, Inc.

While earning his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 1962 and 1964, respectively, Kahn worked as a member of the technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories (Bell Labs). After graduating, he joined the faculty at MIT. In the fall of 1966, Kahn took a leave of absence to work at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). His interest in networking led to a key role as a member of the BBN team that won the contract let by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to build Arpanet. Soon after the initial public demonstration of Arpanet in 1972, Kahn left BBN to work within ARPA to begin planning the world’s first packet radio network. Then in 1974, Kahn and Vinton (Vint) Cerf co-authored the seminal paper: “A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication.” It set forth the initial design of TCP – Transmission Control Protocol. In 1986, Kahn left DARPA and founded the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) to provide leadership and funding for research and development of the National Information Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the very first conversations I had with Paul Baran regarding this project, he counseled that it was imperative that I interview certain individuals, Robert Kahn among them. Of course it didn’t hurt that Paul offered to introduce me and recommend they sit for an interview. Paul called that day and arranged interviews with Kahn and Cerf for the next week at CNRI. On arriving I was informed that Kahn had an emergency that precluded talking with me that day but wanted to schedule another time. I followed through with Cerf, and would later wish that I had even more time to prepare, for both men were especially helpful. (I had to cut the Cerf conversation short for suddenly we were blanketed in a serious snowstorm.) I recommend any reader interested in the history of these events excuse my abilities and enjoy the contributions of an exceptional individual and a most gracious Bob Kahn. This conversation had a wonderful influence on my ideas of how to organize this book and my commitment to see it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Bell Labs, MIT, BBN, packet radio network, Arpanet, TCP/IP, CNRI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/10/102717241-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Kahn Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/22/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Phil-Kaufman/",

With a background in communications theory, Kaufman naturally envisioned a future with communication products consuming lots of silicon. Learning that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was talking with Xerox about Xerox’s Ethernet technology, Kaufman called Gordon Bell of DEC, who he knew from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Bell referred him to David Liddle of Xerox. With early assistance from Bob Metcalfe, acting as a consultant, Liddle, Bell, and Kaufman led the creation of the DIX consortium (Digital Equipment Corporation—Intel—Xerox) that became an active agent in creating the IEEE Ethernet standard. In mid-1982, Kaufman left Intel to, become president of Silicon Compilers. Silicon Compilers had, independently, formed a partnership with Seeq and 3Com that had decided years earlier to design an Ethernet chip as their first product, to prove their software worked. Just as Kaufmann was joining Silicon Compilers, Seeq was beginning to ship their Ethernet controllers, beating Intel to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had only met Kaufman on one other occasion, when we met to discuss a venture capital financing for Silicon Compilers. Later, when I called to ask for this interview, he said he was stressed for time, but if I was willing to conduct it after the close of work someday, he was willing. I didn’t think we would have much to talk about other than his role at Intel when Intel joined the consortium of Xerox and DEC to create the Ethernet standard. I hadn’t considered the importance of Hewlett Packard, for example. Kaufman also discusses the nature of relationships and networks, both personal and those between corporations, and much more. It reminded me of Lick’s conclusion that it is not necessarily the most complete product, but the first to market that wins. Of all the interviews in this collection, this conversation is the most informative one about the role of semiconductors in the history of computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Intel, IEEE Ethernet standard, Silicon Compilers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/05/102746652-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Phil Kaufman Interviewed by James Pelkey 10/1/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Matt-Kinney/",

They moved from Long Branch, NJ to FL to be near NASA type activity doing all kinds of communications work before they developed commercial modems. Kinney describes the company as filled with “inventors, but not exploiters.” Then in the mid 60’s, they hired Sang Wang, a Korean engineer from Brooklyn Poly Tech who was “a genius in filter design.” He managed to put together filters that allowed them, for all practical purposes, to send three bits per baud; that made 4800 bit per second transmission possible on existing telephone lines. By the middle of 1967, Milgo had a superior 4800 bps modem ready to be sold into commercial markets. They now needed someone with commercial sales experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search found Matt Kinney who quickly reached a decision. A reader of this Interview will soon understand why Kinney was a great hire. He joined Milgo on January 15, 1968. Counting Tom Carter as a friend, he was convinced that if the Common Carrier Bureau ruled favorably in the Carterfone case, then the commercial modem market was likely to take off. So in October, after the favorable Carterfone decision, Racal management spun off a subsidiary named the International Communications Corporation, or the ICC. Kinney, Ed Bleckner and about a dozen others were transferred into the ICC, and stock options were created for those challenged to make the commercial side a success. Although the ICC was best known as Milgo, it was marketed under the ICC name until February 1977 when Racal Electronics, in an effort to stave off a hostile take-over attempt by Applied Digital Data Systems (ADDS), ended the hostile action by acquiring Milgo for $62M on February 7, 1977. Racal would end the days of ICC in favor of the name Racal-Milgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinney gives a great overview of the Data Com industry in the years before the Carterfone decision. In addition, he argues the case of using manufacturers representatives; gives his theory as to why technology leadership keeps changing; the benefits of the Carterfone decision; and why Racal-Milgo never entered the LAN market and takes responsibility for missing the T-1 market. Kinney stayed clear of any relationship with Racal-Vadic. He also spoke highly of Bill Dambrackas for role in getting Racal-Milgo into the multiplexer market (See Dambrackas Interview).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Milgo, Carterfone, Racal, International Communications Corporation (ICC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/10/102738573-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matt Kinney Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/9/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Leonard-Kleinrock/",

He had earlier earned his MSEE (1959) from MIT and his BEE (1957) from the City College of New York. His roommates at MIT, Larry Roberts and Ivan Sutherland, shared notable dissertation Advisors, Claude Shannon and Marvin Minsky, and demonstrated their dissertations on the same day using the TX-2 computer at Lincoln Labs that they, and others, had shared for the last three years. Kleinrock describes his dissertation, and thus demonstration, as: “devoted to the study of communication networks, and it basically laid out the analytic formulations for the performance evaluation of what we now call packet networks. It also looked into the design issues; how you do capacity assignment, routing, topology design, etc., of these networks.” McGraw-Hill published his dissertation in 1964 under the title: “Communication Nets; Stochastic Message Flow and Delay.” In addition to a continuing prolific output of technical articles and another book, Kleinrock maintained a heavy academic load including twenty-six graduate students by 1988. Three will play important roles in this history: Steve Crocker, Jon Postel and Vint Cerf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kleinrock’s secretary confirmed an interview date and time, she made it clear that he had to leave at 1:00 PM to catch a flight to Washington D.C. So when I was in the UCLA Engineering offices to conduct another interview, I made sure I could weave my way again through the buildings and hallways to arrive on time. (Although Kleinrock alludes to “my review committee,” it was more formally the National Research Network Review Committee that he chaired and was comprised of eighteen highly regarded scientists. The Committee authored the influential report: Toward a National Research Network that was published by the National Academy Press before year-end 1988.) I was unfamiliar with Kleinrock until I started interviewing others, when it quickly became obvious that he should be included on the must interview list. I was nervous, but he soon made me feel comfortable and he was very forthcoming with information and supportive material. I wish we had had more time to talk, but I think an interested reader will find Kleinrock’s remarks and perspective very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated that Kleinrock had an interest in entrepreneurialism. He mentions two companies in this interview – TTI and Linkabit – and I further discovered that he helped found the Computer Channel in 1988. I easily inferred that he had “ bitten the bug” and would start more companies in the future. I also learned that he has a great sense of humor: see the story of how he met “Howie” Frank, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, UCLA, Arpanet, network topology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/12/102738036-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leonard Kleinrock Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/27/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bill-Krause/",

Before joining 3Com, Krause spent 14 years in marketing and general management at Hewlett-Packard (HP). As a product manager, he helped guide HP’s minicomputer, the HP 3000, from a struggling product with “negative revenues” due to product returns, to over $1 billion in sales in less than 5 years. Krause then became general manager of HP’s personal computer division, where he reasoned that large corporate customers would be more likely to buy PCs in significant numbers if they could be networked together. To do this, HP select Ethernet to interconnect their PCs, and this experience gave Krause a glimpse of the potential for networked personal computing. When Gib Myers, general partner of Mayfield Fund, learned that 3Com was looking for a president as part of a financing, he immediately thought of Krause, who he knew from working at HP. Myers introduced Robert Metcalfe to Krause and the pair soon discovered that they both shared a similar vision for the future of Ethernet – networking PCs. Krause became CEO of 3Com the following year and served as chairman from ’87 to ’93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Com’s first products and services networked minicomputers and workstations, but Krause realized that to be successful in the PC market, they would need to develop a lower-cost version of their Ethernet adapter, which initially consisted of multiple boards and sold for more than a PC itself. 3Com soon became one of the first vendors, along with UB, Xerox &amp;amp; DEC, to develop an Ethernet controller chip, an important step in reducing the costs and the footprint of the adapter. Other companies would eventually develop their own Ethernet PC adapters, but it was Krause &amp;amp; Metcalfe who recognized the future of PC networking early on and decided to divert cash from their profitable lines of minicomputer and workstation products to help fund development of Ethernet products for the PC market. 3Com would further distinguish themselves by selling directly to retail distributers, establishing a deal with Businessland within a month of introducing their first Ethernet adapter for the PC. With affordable products and a market for PCs that was about to explode, 3Com grew rapidly and soon dominated the market for PC LAN hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krause describes 3Com’s growth in the early years of the LAN market as they focused on PC hardware and eventually expanded into LAN management software and applications, in competition with the rapid success of companies like Novell and Lotus. He recounts their merger with Bridge Communications in 1987 and the challenges that followed as Metcalfe and Carrico held differing opinions as to what strategy the company should pursue. This issue of whether to be a computing company or a communications company would plague them well into the late ‘80’s and early ‘90’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arranged for this interview to get an additional point of view on 3Com after my interview with Bob Metcalfe. As with many of the companies I researched, it was helpful to get an additional perspective on the formative issues of the entrepreneurs’ journey, especially with such an iconic tech company as 3Com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, UCLA, Arpanet, network topology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/01/102740543-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Krause Interviewed by James Pelkey 8/19/94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Ken-Krechmer/",

Krechmer’s early career brought him into contact with telemetry at the White Sands Missile Range. Next he worked as an engineer doing communication systems design for Litton. Then Krechmer’s entrepreneurial instincts led him to found a company that used modems in its product: a library circulation and control system. Failing at that, he took a job with Novation, an acoustic coupler company in the LA area. He will tell the story of why and how he joined Vadic in 1973 where he served as sales manager until 1978. By then, Vadic had become a leader in the development and sales of dial-up modems. Krechmer left Vadic in 1978 and founded ACTION Consulting, an independent consulting company focused on standards and standardization and how these requirements impacted the marketing and sales of data and voice communications products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Dolan introduced me to Ken in 1982 when I was in need of a strategic marketing consultant to develop a business plan for ComDesign. I found him to be very knowledgeable about the modem and multiplexer markets and easy to work with. We spent a number of days together and put together a successful plan for a new product launch. We would work together on a number of other company assignments that included a high-speed dial-up modem company, Telebit; a datapbx company, Metapath; and a local area networking company, Communications Machinery Corporation. It was in our many conversations that I was driven to find order in the evolution of Computer Communications. So when I called Ken for an interview, he readily agreed, and we met Bob at the Silicon Valley offices of ComDesign’s venture capital investors, Interwest Partners. In this interview, Ken both discusses the history of Vadic in the 1970s, as well as introduces me to many companies and executives whom I will interview in the year ahead.

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;In the late ‘70s, MITRE Corporation, the government sponsored nonprofit research organization, had developed their own local area networking technology, MITRENET. As interest in networking began to grow throughout their various government sponsors, MITRE saw the need to bring together experts in the field of networking to better understand the needs of potential users and the challenges of developing viable networking products. In late ’78 and early ’79 MITRE organized small forums with LAN experts. Following the interest in these informal meetings, MITRE, along with the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), sponsored the Local Area Communications Network (LACN) Symposium in May 1979 in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LACN symposium brought into full view the need of MITRE’s government sponsors to procure networking technology. MITRE at that point was able to recommend strategies and design prototypes, but its charter did not allow MITRE to sell commercial products. MITRE sought to gather together potential vendors for this new market. The conference was a watershed moment in the history of the LAN industry as it illustrated to many engineers and entrepreneurs the emerging demand for local networking. One month later, in June of ’79, three of the leading LAN companies were founded, 3Com, Ungermann-Bass, &amp;amp; Sytek. As well as providing a catalyst for the growing LAN market, MITRE served as a talent pool for at least two of the major LAN startups: both U-B and Sytek hired engineers with technical background in networking from MITRE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Lee LaBarre and Paul Brusil recall the thinking that led to the first networking forums and eventually to the symposium. They describe the early work that MITRE had done to develop its broadband CSMA network, along with Ford Aerospace, another talent pool of networking engineers, some of whom went on to build Sytek. It was clear to La Barre and Brusil in the spring of ’79 that the MITRE symposium was a tipping point, convincing existing companies, entrepreneurs, and investors that the demand for networking products had the potential to establish a significant market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MITRE Corporation, Local Area Communications Network Symposium, MITRENET, National Bureau of Standards (NBS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102792037-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lee LaBarre &amp;amp; Paul Brusil Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/6/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/J.C.R.-Licklider/",

Licklider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, better known as “Lick,” left an indelible imprint on the history of computers and computer communications. He initiated three important developments in information technology: the granting of Ph.D.’s in computer science, time-sharing, and networking. Dr. Licklider described the vision for computer networking as early as August 1962 in a series of memos at BBN when he coined the phrase: “Intergalactic Computer Network.” He will describe the difficulties that preceded his involvement in the creation of the first computer network: the Arpanet. In fact, this interview becomes more a discussion of his views of technological management rather than an investigation of the details of his accomplishments. Those discussions can be found in many places, whereas this look back by Lick is somewhat more reflective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tremendous honor to call on Dr. Licklider at his home in Arlington, MA. I was nervous and felt underprepared. There was so much I could have, and really should have, read, and even better engaged others in discussion, but I had not, and it was June, and roughly half the interviews had yet to be conducted. In addition, I felt self-imposed guilt and pressure that I was not creating new revenue for my “firm” and partners. The door opens and I say, “Dr. Licklider,” and he says, “please call me ‘Lick’.” He leads the way to his living room where his wife, Louise, greets me: I am no longer nervous but feel graciously welcomed, and at ease. I sit on the couch and start setting up the recorder. Louise asks if we want anything, we decline. Lick then pulls up a clearly favorite wooden chair opposite me, sits and says he is not sure he can help me, but asks what questions do I have. Not surprisingly, Lick throughout comes across as a warm-hearted, generous and accomplished leader who easily shares the credit for so much that happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Lick notes that most innovations are dependent on other innovations becoming ready. He reminded me of Paul Baran’s dictum in our discussions of the history of computer communications that innovators are like “one standing on the shoulders of those who came before them. So please enjoy the words of Lick, who consistently deflects any special place in history, and was a pure joy to be with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview focuses on Dr. Licklider’s involvement with Project MAC at MIT, the Arpanet, being the first Director of ARPA’s IPTO, his role in promoting networking and his thoughts on science research and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, Project MAC, ARPA IPTO, Arpanet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/03/102717159-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;J.C.R.

David, a friend of Bob Metcalfe’s, would play an important role in Xerox’s decision to place its Ethernet patents into the public domain, and to the forming of the DIX (Digital Equipment Corporation—Intel—Xerox) partnership that would deal with, in David’s words, “the howling mob of the IEEE 802 Committee.” The connection made in this interview led to a future collaboration with James L.

(Don) Loughry joined Hewlett-Packard in 1956 and was instrumental in developing HP’s proprietary interface bus for connecting instruments, HP-IB. Loughry then led the effort to make this a standard interface through the IEEE 488 committee, which established the standard in 1978. In the 488 meetings, Loughry met Maris Graube, who was interested in promoting a standard for the evolving technologies of local computer networks. Together they attempted to convince the ANSI X3T9 committee to pursue such a standard but were unsuccessful due to the committee’s focus on mainframe computer communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughry, along with Graube and Robert Rosenthal of the NBS, moved instead to establish the standard through IEEE, and in February 1980, they held the first meeting of the IEEE 802 committee at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco. Loughry joined as a representative from HP, which at the time was developing its own version of a CSMA/CD network. Loughry eventually chaired the subcommittee responsible for developing the CSMA/CD standard (802.3). HP’s support of a CSMA/CD standard was critical in the early stages of the 802 committee, when the DEC/Intel/Xerox consortium (DIX) was facing considerable opposition to its proposed Ethernet standard from proponents of token passing networks. Loughry was recruited by Robert Metcalfe and John Shoch of Xerox to act as a spokesperson in support of CSMA/CD. In support of CSMA/CD, Loughry presented research HP had done on critical issues involving the performance of CSMA/CD networks. In an 802 committee meeting in December 1980, a vote was taken to abandon the pursuit of a CSMA/CD standard, but opponents did not receive the 2/3rd majority needed, thus ensuring a path forward for the Ethernet standard along with other standards for token bus and later, token ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Loughry relates his experience maneuvering through the meetings of the 802 committee and the 802.3 CSMA/CD subcommittee. He describes the many challenges of bringing the standard proposed by DIX in the first ‘Blue Book’ in line with the needs of other proponents of Ethernet; testing various implementations, especially concerning the transceiver; and finding consensus on what to make standard and what to leave unspecified.

After proving to the ARPA community that the TCP/IP protocols were ready, came the task of replacing the original, and still functioning, NCP protocols with TCP/IP. This undertaking was comparable to the initial effort by Larry Roberts to convince the early sites to attach their Host computers to the Arpanet. Only this time, from 1980-1983, the designated manager was Dan Lynch. Dan graduated with a Masters in Mathematics from UCLA a few years before the graduate students who implemented the Arpanet. Dan’s expertise would not be as a research scientist, but as a manager of computing facilities, skilled in integrating new programs and equipment with existing facilities and keeping everything running smoothly. In 1973, he was manager of the computing laboratory for the Artificial Intelligence Center at Stanford Research Institute, or SRI. By the mid 70’s, he was Director of Computing Facilities at SRI International where he performed initial development of the TCP/IP protocols in conjunction with Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). From 1980 to 1983, he was Director of the Information Processing Division for the Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey (USC-ISI) while also leading the team that made sure all Arpanet sites successfully transitioned off the NCP protocols onto the TCP/IP protocols. He next sought freedom, but realized the business world misunderstood the significance of TCP/IP to internetworking. So he organized a series of workshops in Monterey, CA that then led to his founding of Interop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can still see myself getting out of my car in Dan’s driveway and hearing the sound of voices in heated exchange. So I walked to the back of the house, entered a kitchen that was buried under piles of ConneXions magazines and introduced myself. After explaining why I was there, Dan and Ole Jacobson led the way to a picnic table sheltered from the sun – their conference table. Dan’s enthusiasm and energy was contagious and after the interview we agreed to get together again, and again, until we became good friends. I treasure our relationship that has survived the years.

MacLean had joined Tymnet in 1977 after starting her career at its parent company, Tymshare, five years earlier. Tymnet was initially a public data network, but in 1981, Tymnet began to sell private data networks to customers such as Bank of America. MacLean was instrumental in making that sale for Tymnet and saw first-hand how companies were responding to the instability in the telecommunications market by taking responsibility for their own voice and data networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tymnet, MacLean was also tasked with signing up customers for an engineering project to test a high-bandwidth communication network from New York to San Francisco. The project was headed by Roger Chrisman, and what immediately became clear to both was the need for a switch that could interconnect multiple T1 lines. MacLean realized that the opportunities were huge for anyone who could develop a product to integrate voice and data traffic on the same backbone network. Together with Chrisman, they proposed the idea to Tymnet management. But management did not envision themselves as a hardware company, preferring to focus on their core business of building X.25 networks and selling their own software to manage these networks. So, in July of ’82, MacLean, Chrisman and Chrisman’s wife, Sarah Schlinger, left Tymnet to start their own company, PCM, to develop the T1 switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing they needed a team with additional engineering and leadership experience, they enlisted three more co-founders; Robbie Forkish, a programmer who had coded much of the X.25 network management software at Tymnet; Walt Gill, who had been chief engineer at Avantek and who had extensive experience in telecommunications networks; and Bruce Smith, an ex COMSAT executive who would become CEO. They incorporated Network Equipment Technologies (NET) in May of ’83. As a condition of their first round of funding, the team needed to establish the existence of potential customers. To this end, MacLean organized a series of meetings with Fortune 500 companies up and down the East Coast to discuss their communications needs and the commercial potential for NET’s product. As Bruce Smith remembers in his interview, their responses were more than encouraging: Most responded along the lines of, “I don’t believe you can do it, but if you can do it, I’ll buy a truckload.” NET closed its first round of financing of $4.3 million in August of ’83. Their first product the IDNX T1 switch, released in January 1985, was an immediate success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, MacLean gives a detailed description of the circumstances surrounding the founding of NET and the recruitment of its talented team of founders. I was impressed with MacLean’s intelligence and eloquence; it was clear from the beginning that she had a deep understanding of the market opportunity that NET was established to pursue and was essential to its success.

Maxwell, 29 years old, had little practical experience to rely on, having been a student at Stanford for ten years where he studied philosophy for eight years before switching to mathematics for the last two years. In the founders’ struggle to choose a strategy, they decided on modems for Maxwell knew something about them. For six months the founders took no salaries, before finally raising $185,000 by summer’s end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their first strategy was to build OEM modems. By 1971, after finally learning about Carterfone, they decided building Bell 103 modems a better choice than one-off OEM modems. That led them to build the MVS-1 rackmount central site system. In 1972, Maxwell, now named President, hired an engineering manager who in turn introduced John Bingham (see interview of John Bingham) to the company. Bingham was a key hire who, with Maxwell and others, innovated the first full-duplex 1200 bps modem – the Vadic VA3400. By 1974, a rash of mistakes led the Board to demote Maxwell to the engineering and marketing ranks. There he excelled, closing key customers, like Instruments et al, and perfecting the 3400. However, their technological advantage seemed lost when AT&amp;amp;T introduced the backward compatible Bell 212 1200 bps modem in 1976. Maxwell and Bingham rose to the occasion, however, and developed the wildly successful “triple modem”. Internal strife between the Board and management resulted in the sale to Racal Electronics in 1978 for $20M, in a year when Vadic’s sales grew to $10M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1979, Maxwell and Ken Krechmer, who had been Director of Sales since 1973 when he joined the company (See Interview of Ken Krechmer), met and developed a successful product strategy as well as an energizing innovation to create stocking representatives, both actions that propelled company sales to $90M by 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Maxwell was once again promoted to President. This time the exercise lasted just four years until early 1988. In large measure, the cause was the costly failure to partner with Texas Instruments to reduce the triple modem to a chip. In Maxwell’s words: “We lost the technology edge we’ve never recovered.” Furthermore, key personnel turnover, Krechmer (1979) and Bingham (1984) robbed Vadic of talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Vadic, VA3400, Bell 212, Triple modem, dial-up modem, AT&amp;amp;T, UDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/09/102740207-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kim Maxwell Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/19/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Jerry-McDowell/",

In 1975 he landed a job as a network manager for Databank, a collaboration of New Zealand Banks established to share the expense of implementing computerized transactions and accounting. McDowell helped Databank connect their network of bank offices using single cable, point-to-point connections. The experience served McDowell well for his next job as a product planning manager at Paradyne, which he started in 1978. At Paradyne, he was responsible for planning future network management products and, in an effort to stay current with the latest in networking technology, he joined the IEEE 802 committee on networking standards as one of its original members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell was an early proponent of LAN technology and in an effort to convince Paradyne to develop LAN products, he arranged for Bob Metcalfe to give a presentation on Ethernet to management. Paradyne, a market leader in modems at the time, chose not to partner with Metcalfe and 3Com and instead, to develop their PIX network management system to support their strong base of modem customers. McDowell faced a similar response when he tried to convince his next employer, Systems Engineering Laboratories (SEL), a subsidiary of Gould Electronics, to enter the LAN business. He arranged for another presentation by Metcalfe, which also fell on the deaf ears of SEL management. Convinced of the future of the LAN industry, in 1982 McDowell took a job in product marketing at Wang Laboratories, joining them just after they had introducing WangNet. As a representative of Wang, McDowell gave frequent presentations on the broadband transmission of WangNet, often at the same events where Metcalfe or Liddle were presenting the baseband architecture of Ethernet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Wang in ’83, McDowell worked as a consultant and then as an analyst for Dataquest, which is where I sat with him for this interview. Jerry was full of inside perspectives on the early LAN industry, particularly from his involvement in the 802 committee. He had a wealth of information on the early developments of LAN standards, from the initial meeting at the Jack Tar hotel in San Francisco, to the adoption of the industry dominant standard for Ethernet on twisted pair wiring. For someone who is interested in gaining a perspective on the developments in the LAN business and the standards making process, this interview offers a unique look at the many key events and players involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Paradyne, IEEE 802 committee, Wang Computers, WangNet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/01/102740544-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jerry McDowell Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/10/92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Robert-Metcalfe/",

In one propitious moment, a motivated young scientist was thrust into the forefront of a technological paradigm shift that would engage his professional passions and to which he would make seminal technological and economic contributions. Metcalfe’s roles with Arpanet would expand, including becoming a member of the Network Working Group and coordinating the scenarios for the International Conference on Computer Communication (ICCC) demonstration in ‘72. He based his PhD thesis on the Arpanet and landed a job with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Fate struck again when his dissertation committee rejected his thesis for not being “sufficiently mathematical.” Metcalfe beefed up his thesis by studying the ALOHAnet, which helped build his understanding of how to create a new local area networking (LAN) technology for Xerox: Ethernet. In 1979, Metcalfe left Xerox to begin consulting to spread the word of computer networking and to find a way to free Ethernet from the proprietary grasp of Xerox. He again succeeded when Xerox agreed to work with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Intel to make Ethernet a public standard. In June 1979, Metcalfe founded 3Com, a company that would become a leader in networking and an important participant in internetworking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Ethernet, Arpanet, NWG, ICCC demonstration, Xerox PARC, ALOHAnet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/05/102746650-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Metcalfe Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/16/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Ken-Miller/",

Educated as an analog engineer, Miller joined Codex Corporation in 1972 when it was a small company with approximately $2 million in revenue. When he resigned, in 1980, he had become Director of Modem Development and Codex had become the leading modem company with revenue of roughly $100 million. He left because he wanted Codex to enter the dial-up modem business and his managers disagreed. Frustrated, he soon learned that he had expertise and skills in great demand. He started a small consulting company, and luckily got drawn into the just emerging local area networking market. In January 1981, he founded Concord Data Systems (CDS). CDS would be the only data communication start-up to also innovate a local area network (LAN). Miller would become influential in the political workings of IEEE Committee 802, and the mechanics of how Ethernet became the first LAN standard and token bus and token ring became equal standards. Standards making took time and effort from running CDS, however, and problems ensued. Miller’s enthusiasm and penchant for hard work could not compensate for his lack of executive experience, as the rapidly changing LAN market punished weak strategies and weaker management execution. Miller refused to concede, even as problems compounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met Ken when CDS was trying to raise venture capital from new investors. There was no doubt that he was a personable and engaging individual; yet equally, a walk around the company’s offices, and particularly its manufacturing operations, felt more like a disorganized start-up than a firm needing growth capital. My partners and I turned the investment down, even as we hoped the best for him. It did, however, make it easy to both ask for an interview and set a tone of talking to a friend. In all fairness, trying to accomplish what Miller and his team took on, that is entering both the dial-up modem and token-bus LAN markets, would have challenged the best executives. Here is a story of a start-up that seemed to be on the road to success and then encountered technological problems, way too much competition and a strategy that hobbled an overwhelmed management team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Codex, Concord Data Systems, LAN, IEEE Committee 802&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/10/102737985-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ken Miller Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/23/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Jerry-Mulvenna/",

One of his first jobs was contributing to the development of the OSI messaging protocol, X.400. In March of ’81 Mulvenna attended the first meeting on X.400 by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) held in The Hague. This was a continuation of work on X.400 which had originated in the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As NBS began to promote the adoption of OSI standards to ensure compatibility between government agencies acquiring networking and internetworking products, Mulvenna helped to organize NBS sponsored OSI implementors workshops. These were meetings of industry representatives with NBS to establish agreements on implementations of OSI compliant products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When John Heafner left NBS, Mulvenna took over management of OSINET and GOSIP. OSINET was the NBS project in which vendors could install and test their products on an OSI compliant network. The Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) specified a series of OSI implementation agreements as the basis for federal OSI standards, which eventually led to a Federal Information Processing Standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview Mulvenna describes the early attempts NBS made to promote its version of the X.400 messaging protocol and the challenges of working in the CCITT with proponents of other versions, specifically around the issue of syntax. He also gives a detailed description of OSINET. Readers interested in the history of the federal government and OSI should also read the interviews of James White, John Heafner and Robert Rosenthal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: OSI, X.400, Government OSI Profile (GOSIP), OSINET, National Bureau of Standards (NBS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102792039-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jerry Mulvenna Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/23/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bert-Nordin/",

At the time, DCA was doing roughly $3-4 million in sales from a small line of communications processors, mainly for DEC computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nordin’s first order of business as CEO was to stop shipment of their product in order to fix a high percentage of faulty units. Within the first year he also replaced and rebuilt the sales and marketing teams, investing heavily in both, and by the end of fiscal year ’83 had brought revenues up to $14 million. By late ’82 the market for tech companies, particularly in the communications sector, was heating up and DCA capitalized on the trend with an initial public offering in February ’83. Soon after the IPO, DCA acquired Technical Analysis Corporation (TAC), a company that manufactured a board that enabled a personal computer to emulate an IBM terminal. Nordin had initially thought that adding expertise in IBM communications protocols would enhance their front-end processor products, but the explosion of the PC market provided a wave of demand which they rode throughout the ‘80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nordin’s goal was to build DCA into a major competitor in networking and data communications and to this end he sought to acquire startups with expertise across a wide range of communications products. After the acquisition of TAC, DCA attempted to acquire Rixon, the modem manufacturer that also sold stat muxes from the British firm, CASE. DCA was eager to acquire their direct sales force, one with the technical experience of selling stat muxes, but the deal fell through over threats of a lawsuit from CASE. In ’86 DCA acquired Forte Communications and in ’87, Microstuf Inc, both competitors in the PC to mainframe terminal emulator market. In August of ’87, after unsuccessfully courting leading LAN companies 3Com and Ungermann-Bass, they acquired Fox Research and created the independent subsidiary 10Net Communications to market Fox’s LAN product. Seeking a foothold in the market for networking T1 multiplexers, DCA sought to acquire NET, but balked at the $200 million price tag NET was asking. In September of ’87, DCA acquired NET competitor Cohesive Network, after a legal battle with NET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Nordin describes the steps he and DCA management took to achieve this goal of establishing the company for the long haul. In his words, “Our feeling was at the time that if you’re going to be one of the longer term players, you better put together a pretty broad spectrum of data communications products and become pretty large or you’re not going to be one of the survivors. So that’s essentially what we did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Digital Communications Associates (DCA), Forte Communications, Microstuf Inc, CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/03/102792036-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bert Nordin Interviewed by James Pelkey 10/29/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bill-Norred/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;Bill Norred and Art Wilkes started American Data Systems (ADS) in the spring of 1968 in Art Wilkes’ garage in Woodland Hills. Norred and his new bride had moved from Texas to help engineer Wilkes’ idea for a product. When Norred arrived, Wilkes told him the financing had fallen through, so Norred and his wife moved in to Wilkes’ den. Over the course of six months, they built a prototype of the 660, a time division multiplexer (TDM), a significant improvement on the Frequency Division Multiplexers in use at the time. In their first year of business they did over $1 Million in sales, and $5 million their second year. While at ADS, Norred was in charge of engineering and manufacturing and saw the 660, one of the first TDMs for data communication, quickly become a hot selling product. Within 18 months ADS would have over 400 employees. Its popularity was due in large part to the rise of timesharing, in which many slow speed terminals could share a phone line to connect to a remote computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fortunes of ADS grew, they felt they needed to sell a high-speed modem in addition to their multiplexer. An agreement was made with Rockwell International, which had designed a 4800 bps automatically equalized modem, for the rights to build the modem in exchange for a controlling interest in ADS. The modem didn’t work, however, and by the time they had it working, they had lost market share to competitors Codex and Milgo. ADS hit financial troubles in 1973 and was put into Chapter 10 bankruptcy by Rockwell. Norred attributed the downfall to three main causes: problems with the Rockwell modem, mismanagement, and the downturn in the economy. As the company was being liquidated, Norred took one of the remaining orders for a new version of the ADS multiplexer, the 670, and started Micom. He was soon joined by Roger Evans who had worked for CASE, the client in England that had made the order for the 670’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Micom introduced a statistical multiplexer, a new evolution of multiplexer that used integrated circuits to control data flow on a shared line. Norred remembers removing enough chips from their original design to bring the unit’s price down to $2,000. The Micro800 Data Concentrator was an instant hit and made a name for Micom as ‘the orange juice’ company, a name taken from the glossy color photo pamphlets and ads that showed the unit next to a can of frozen orange juice concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Norred’s responsibilities of running the company overshadowed his ability to spend time on engineering, Norred and Evans hired Steve Frankel to take over management of product development in 1980. The addition of a line of data PBX products to compliment their data concentrators helped them achieve a successful IPO and a market capitalization of nearly $190 million in June of 1981 (compared to their original financing of $220,000 in 1976). By 1985, the market for data PBX’s was loosing customers to the growing LAN business. Though Norred and Evans had prided themselves with being a simple, product based company, the demands of higher bandwidth networking required companies to offer systems based solutions, which included software, not just hardware. They acquired Interlan in 1985 in an attempt to enter the LAN business, but they struggled to integrate the two companies. Micom’s sales continued to flag and Norred wanted out. His attempt to sell his shares, led to a leveraged buyout of Micom in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Norred describes critical management decisions of ADS and Micom as they navigated the early days of the data communications market. His approach was, as Evans described of them both, “conservative”. He managed to innovate and take advantage of a lean, low cost strategy that proved a winner for almost two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: American Data Systems (ADS); Frequency Division multiplexer; Time Division Multiplexer; Rockwell; Micom; Statistical multiplexer; Micro800 Data Concentrator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: American Data Systems (ADS), Micom, Micro800 Data Concentrator,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/07/102738827-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Norred Interviewed by James Pelkey 4/27/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Phil-Nyborg/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;Phillip (Phil) Nyborg received his JD from the University of Michigan Law School and from ’75 to ’78 was the head of the Washington, DC office of the American Federation of Information Processing Services (AFIPS). In 1978 he became general counsel of the Computer &amp;amp; Communication Industry Association (CCIA). CCIA represented computer and data communications vendors working to promote industry competition in the shadows of major incumbents AT&amp;amp;T and IBM. Its members included founders and CEOs of many of the datacom startups, including Chuck Johnson of General DataComm and John Alderman of DCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CCIA general counsel, Nyborg testified in congress in hearings on The Consumer Communications Reform Act of 1976, otherwise known as “The Bell Bill,” a bill proposed by AT&amp;amp;T to reassert the monopoly position of the Bell System. He also represented CCIA in testimony regarding the FCC’s Computer Inquiry II, which sought to further define the division between the telecommunications and data communications markets. Nyborg presented the position of independent data communications startups selling innovative products for communicating data over telephone lines. The fear of these small companies was that AT&amp;amp;T would introduce competing products, such as its Dataspeed 40/4 data terminal, and drive the startups out of business by cross-subsidizing these products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1981, Nyborg joined MCI as vice president for regulation and industry relations. At that time MCI was involved in the appeals to its antitrust suit against AT&amp;amp;T. Evidence in the MCI case was used in the government’s own antitrust case against AT&amp;amp;T which eventually led to the breakup of the Bell System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview took place at Nyborg’s office at MCI and was one of my first interviews. He was very helpful in giving me background on trade organizations and legal issues in the early data communications market. Unfortunately, the recording of the interview was cut off before the end of the interview.

He worked for Ford Aerospace and the National Security Agency (NSA) before founding Sytek in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pliner co-founded Sytek to service the nascent field of local area networking. That same month, Robert Metcalfe co-founded 3Com and Ralph Ungermann and Charlie Bass founded Ungermann-Bass. Pliner recalls early discussions with Bass &amp;amp; Metcalfe in the months leading up to and after founding their businesses. Pliner and Metcalfe had discussed working together as had Ungermann, Bass &amp;amp; Metcalfe, but the three parties eventually decided to go their own ways. Pliner’s company, Sytek, succeeded in capturing the early market for broadband networks with clients like the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) and Brown University, where the large campus-wide terminal-to-host networks were better suited to broadband’s more affordable cabling setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Pliner discusses the challenges, missteps and successes of Sytek’s strategy in local area networking. Like his fellow LAN industry entrepreneurs, which would also include Bridge Communications founders, Judy Estrin and Bill Carrico, the fates of each company were closely tied to the fates of their clients and the technology in which they chose to invest. For Sytek, their strategic partnership with IBM appeared to be a winning strategy; sales of hardware and software for IBM’s PC LAN provided close to half of their revenue in 1985. The following year, however, IBM management made the decision to constrain their broadband PC LAN to the workgroup computing market, opting to go with Token Ring technology for the market for larger enterprise, campus and municipal networks. This effectively killed sales of Sytek’s IBM products; broadband was too expensive for small, workgroup networking. Sytek was purchased by the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Sytek; 3Com; Ungermann-Bass, Inc.

With DARPA’s encouragement, that began the journey of a version of token ring technology from UC Irvine through MIT’s LCS (Laboratory of Computer Science) to Proteon. I wanted to interview Ken to learn his views on how, and if, that version of token ring LAN technology was passed to IBM or, in his opinion, influenced IBM in any way. Ken also had a unique vantage point to opine on the many individuals who shaped the early history of local area networking (LAN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Ken describes his work at MIT with the Multics operating system, his first encounter with the Arpanet, and collaboration with the small group of computer networking experts in the early 1970s. Pogran describes collaboration on local area networking technologies with various groups at MIT, as well as with Bob Metcalfe at Xerox, Dave Farber at UC Irvine, and various experts at the networking company Proteon. He also reflects on the technological progression from networking technologies in the 1970s to internetworking in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Pogran worked as a MIT graduate student at Project MAC from 1970 to 1972. He then worked as a research staffer at the MIT Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) from 1972 to 1980. In 1980, Ken moved to Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) to continue his research in LAN technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met Ken during the lunch hour at his office at BBN. It turned out that we had some extra time that we needed for he was able to contribute details that made, and make, many of the events surrounding the evolution of LAN technologies in the 1970’s “come to life.” He worked closely with Jerry Saltzer and Dave Clark, two professors in the MIT LCS, and both whom I also interviewed.

Conceived by Steve Crocker in the early days of the Network Working Group (NWG) meetings, the RFC was to record unofficial communications on the development of the Arpanet. Later the RFC would become the official source of documentation of Internet specifications, communication protocols, procedures and events. RFC followed the evolution of the Arpanet organizational structure, and from the beginning Jon Postel was the Editor. Hence why I felt this interview was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Bruce Postel, or Jon, decided to attend UCLA at a propitious time. He earned his B.S. (1967) and then M.S. (1968) in Engineering before entering graduate school in computer science. He soon began working on a project under the direction of Professor’s Kleinrock and Estrin and funded by ARPA, the goal being to measure computer performance. When Kleinrock secured an additional ARPA grant to become the first node of Arpanet, as well as the role of the Network Measurement Center, the project Postel was working on changed to measuring the Arpanet. As a founding member of the NWG, Postel volunteered to become the Editor of the RFCs. He earned his Ph.D. in 1974 with Dave Farber serving as his thesis advisor. On graduation, Jon went to work for MITRE in Washington D.C. He soon learned he wanted to be an engineer: MITRE only did studies. He left and over the summer fixed the networking access of the software of ARPAs offices’, an overhaul long over due. Next he joined Doug Englebart at SRI International, where he helped start the Network Information Center or (NIC) and contribute to the Network Software Works. In March 1977, he left to join the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California. Jon continued to be the RFC Editor as well as an invaluable member of many Internet committees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have eliminated a source of surprise when I called on Jon if I had only looked up his picture beforehand. On arriving at ISI, it was as I expected; a large rectangular-shaped box, of lifeless dark colors, and a few struggling trees framing the entranceway. Inside the heavily air-conditioned air was at first cold to breathe in. Although no one shared Jon’s office, other than a secretary, no one could have given the lack of free space. Jon suddenly emerged from behind cabinets and stacks of books. How incongruous, a full-bearded hippie inside a conservative think tank! Jon was a delight to interview and very helpful. Even so, as I drove away I couldn’t help but shake my head seeing Jon “inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: UCLA, Network Working Group, RFC Editor, Douglas Engelbart, Information Sciences Institute (ISI)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/05/102738139-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jon Postel Interviewed by James Pelkey 2/18/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Louis-Pouzin/",

His achievements often placed him at odds with government and business entities vested in the technology of the day, but some of his key ideas have survived to become founding principles of today’s Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pouzin attended École Polytechnique and worked for the French computer company Bull, managing a team of software engineers, before traveling to the US to work at MIT on their first large scale time-sharing system (CTSS). For this system, he wrote a program for simplifying commands (RUNCOM) that he termed a ‘shell’ program, which became a forerunner of an entire class of command language programs. After returning to France, Pouzin was chosen to lead a government sponsored networking project to help promote the country’s computer industry. Before starting the project, Pouzin traveled back to the US to meet with key developers of Arpanet who shared with him lessons they had learned building their newly operational network. Pouzin returned to France with ideas for improvements. Based on theoretical simulation studies by Donald Davies at NPL, and on his own predilection for simplicity, Pouzin designed the CYCLADES network, as it became known, without the need for IMP hardware over a subnet. He used a new idea of packet switching, a packet he coined a “Datagram”, that could be sent over PTT provided telephone circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the French government stopped funding the CYCLADES program in the late ‘70’s, and the network went offline in 1981, the concepts Pouzin had implemented were heavily influential in the development of future Internet architecture, especially the TCP/IP protocols. While their decision to abandon CYCLADES left the French on the sidelines in the future development of the Internet, Pouzin’s vision of a simplified method for connecting diversified networks together contributed greatly to its future design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to meet with Pouzin at a busy restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. A gracious and polite man, Pouzin talked freely about his work and past.

The DCA was founded in May of 1960 with the mission of operational control of the Defense Communication System. At first, the DCA let a contract to centralize worldwide control in Washington DC. But as integrating dozens of incompatible networks with entrenched interests proved too ambitious, the DCA let a second contract to IBM to establish a decentralized system of Area Centers that would preprocess information and facilitate network integration. Pugh’s assignment was to supervise the ‘programming effort of the Area Centers’ … ‘ to use computers to keep track of the status of communication circuits worldwide.’ It was then that he learned to appreciate the limitation of 1200 bps modems. So when Art Carr, Director of Marketing of Computer Control Corporation (C3), launched a search for someone to fill the role of Marketing Manager for Communications Applications, Pugh was a perfect fit. So in 1965, Pugh left the Army and joined C3. Pugh then followed Carr to Codex in 1968 were he would have a highly successful career, serving in senior marketing, strategic planning, and project and engineering management roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Pugh skillfully weaves the history of Codex with the development and evolution of the entire data communications industry, focusing on key product, market, and regulatory trends, as well as the companies and people who shaped the industry in the later part of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first interview with an executive from the leased-line market and I could not have been more fortunate. John was exceptionally knowledgeable, felt no time constraints, was willing to share his experiences and was as friendly and gracious as any interviewee could be. I took his advice as whom I should interview and found Pugh’s remarks accurate and balanced. This is a long interview, seventy pages in length, and a must for any avid historian. As I set up my recording equipment, and John left to get us coffee, I had time to scan cabinet surfaces filled with family photographs, organizational mementos, artifacts we would soon discuss and paperwork everywhere, but seemingly organized, and a neat desktop. In all it was a cozy office with a large window and the sense of a senior executive who had served his time and had earned organizational loyalty. Returning carrying Styrofoam cups, John encouraged me to make myself comfortable.

Excelan became a leading LAN firm; one built by first innovating “smart Ethernet” cards that unwittingly led the company down the path of doing way too many products. By fiscal year end 1984, Excelan had sales of $5.2 Million but a loss of $2.6 Million. The company had proven to lack the discipline to avert the financial problems created by their overly ambitious product strategy. The Board of Directors responded by removing Dr. Inder Singh as president and promoting Kanwal Rekhi to the position of interim president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rekhi immediately refocused and simplified the company’s product strategy to one of Ethernet boards with the TCP/IP protocol. The result was virtually instantaneous with sales doubling to $10.1 Million in 1985 with a small profit. 1986 was another great year with sales of $ 22.3 Million and profits of $3.5 Million. Anticipating another great year, the Board acted to dress up the company for an IPO they hoped would happen in early 1987. Concerned that having an Indian president would be viewed as a risk, they hired a successful HP executive, C. Richard Moore and went public in February of ’87. Under Moore’s leadership, the company’s sales began to slow down. After returning from a needed vacation to a “decidedly downbeat” mood at the company, Rekhi was able to add additional marketing spending that again boosted growth. The board began looking for an exit strategy later in ’87, and found one in Network Equipment Technologies (NET), which was interested in a merger. Before the merger, Moore left the company after a falling out, and the board appointed Rekhi CEO again to take his place. Rekhi was against the merger, however, and they called the deal off. Only a few months later, news became public that NET had been “cooking their books.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, I was interested in learning more about Rekhi’s role at Zilog and Excelan and his early focus on TCP/IP and Ethernet, long before many of the other networking firms that were pursuing a much wider array of networking solutions. I was also interested in getting another perspective on Dan Lynch’s role as a consultant to Excelan and Rekhi’s view of Lynch’s Interop Conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Zilog, Excelan Inc, TCP/IP, Ethernet, Interop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/04/102738774-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kanwal Rekhi Interviewed by James Pelkey 8/17/94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Larry-Roberts/",

Yet he was much more than an accomplished scientist/computer engineer, for he was a founder of Telenet and as the CEO took the company public, all while devoting considerable time and energy within CCITT, working to create the X.25 standard. Two years later, in 1979, he managed the sale of Telenet to GTE Corporation for approximately $90 M. He remained with GTE for another year, before leaving to found four more companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earning his PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1963, Roberts worked at MIT Lincoln Labs as did his two office mates Ivan Sutherland and Leonard Kleinrock. Roberts, who had been working for Wes Clark writing system software for the TX-2, informally took over Clark’s project after Clark left in a dispute with management. Roberts returned to Lincoln Labs after graduation. Then in 1966, Bob Taylor recruited him to be Project Manager of the Arpanet Project. When Taylor resigned to join Xerox PARC, Roberts took over his responsibilities as Director of the IPTO Office. He would then fund numerous other projects, including ALOHAnet and Douglas Engelbart’s Augmentation Research Center at SRI international.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was clear from the start that the reconstruction of the Arpanet history would not be credible without an interview with Roberts. So I waited until I better understood that history before calling him. To my delight, he joked that since I had talked to nearly everyone else, he had better make sure my facts were correct. Nearly three decades later I can still see the two of us sitting in a room full of tables holding computers and other electronic equipment in various stages of being assembled and tested. He sat not at a desk, but before a computer with me next to him and we talked. And while it was clear his attention was mostly on the computer, I feel it made his answers more spontaneous. When I later read the transcription and realized how much we did not have time to discuss, I called for a rare second interview, and he readily agreed to meet again. So enjoy two interviews with a man secure in his accomplishments and with nothing to prove or assert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Arpanet, x.25, Lincoln Labs, IPTO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102746626-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Larry Roberts Interviewed by James Pelkey 6/17/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Robert-Rosenthal/",

His first job at NBS was connecting their Terminal Interface Processor (TIP) to the Arpanet and then performing studies on network traffic from the Arpanet end users to the subnet IMP or TIP processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ’75-’76 NBS built an early 1Mbps CSMA/CD network for terminal access to its mainframe computers. It serviced over 1,000 nodes at NBS facilities in Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO. Based on the success of NBSNET, in the winter of ’77, Rosenthal and other NBS staff invited influential researchers and innovators in the field of networking to a meeting at NBS. Other informal workshops took place as NBS tried to determine how to facilitate access to evolving networking technology for government agencies. The culmination of this effort, The Local Area Computer Networking (LACN) symposium in May of ’79 in Boston, sponsored by NBS and MITRE Corporation, was chaired by Rosenthal and Norman Meisner of MITRE. The event was a watershed in the emerging technology of local area networking as it was clear evidence to early researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs that the market for LAN products was real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his acquaintance with Maris Graube, Rosenthal became chairman of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Communications. Graube and Rosenthal, both interested in the prospect of creating voluntary standards for networking technology, proposed and received authorization for IEEE project 802 and in February of 1980, they held the first meeting of the 802 committee at the Jack Tar hotel in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal’s goal was to use the IEEE 802 committee as a vehicle to get industry to agree on voluntary standards so that NBS could create a Federal Information Processing Standard. The NBS strategy was to work with international organizations on the development of OSI compliant standards. In ’82 &amp;amp; ’83 NBS sponsored the OSI implementors workgroups. These workgroups led to a demonstration the following year at the 1984 National Computer Conference in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October ’84, NBS published FIPS 107, providing a standard for all government agencies procuring networking products for CSMA/CD networks. By January of ’88, the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) was established, specifying a series of OSI implementation agreements as the basis for federal OSI standards. (It would be followed by a more comprehensive FIPS 146-1 in 1990.) Readers interested in 802 standards should also read the interview of Maris Graube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: National Bureau of Standards (NBS), Arpanet, Local Area Computer Networking Symposium, IEEE 802 Committee, Government OSI Profile (GOSIP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102792038-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Rosenthal Interviewed by James Pelkey 5/4/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Jerry-Saltzer/",

Corbato. He then joined MIT’s faculty as a member of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In addition to teaching, he was able to continue his research in timesharing. By the early 1970’s, he became one of the team leaders for the Multics operating system Project. Later in the 1970’s, the research group he led, known as the Computer Systems Research group, made key contributions in local area networking. Those contributions are what motivated this interview, and those of two of his team members: David Clark and Ken Pogran, as well as of a key consultant: Howard Salwen of Proteon. In 1975, when MIT’s Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) became interested in local area networking, ARPA encouraged them to investigate the unique token ring technology being developed by David Farber (also interviewed as part of this Collection of Interviews) and his team at the University of California at Irvine. Pogran would visit them and on his return to MIT, the LCS team decided to import Farber’s token ring local area network. That story is retold in a number of interviews. The second major contribution was Clark’s TCP/IP port to the IBM PC. Then in 1977, Saltzer took a sabbatical and went to work for IBM. At the time, IBM was also exploring token ring in its Zurich Laboratory. Compelling questions in this reconstruction will be how and why did IBM elect to use token ring for its local area networks. In 1984, Saltzer’s involvement in local area networking ended when he became Technical Director of MIT’s Project Athena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviewing Professor Saltzer was an unexpected joy. Whereas I had been forewarned that he might be a challenge to interview, difficult to read and prone to short answers, I found him anything but. He reflects on a variety of technologies – such as personal computing and TCP/IP protocols – and the factors that lead some technologies to succeed, such as the confluence of strong researchers and problems that are amenable to breakthroughs, and others to fail. Unfortunately, I did not get definitive answers to my questions of how IBM settled on token ring, but it seems clear that the path of technology transfer did progress in part from MIT to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT LCS, Chaosnet, Ethernet, token ring, local area networking, Proteon, IBM Zurich Laboratories, Bob Metcalfe, David Farber, TCP/IP, ARPA, IBM PC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/10/102717242-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jerry Saltzer Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/7/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Howard-Salwen/",

As a graduate student and later as an employee, he worked with the MIT Electronic Systems Laboratory on contract projects for the defense department, including research and development of high-resolution radar technology. In 1972 he co-founded Proteon, and won contracts from NASA, DOT, Draper Labs, and others, to design and build communications hardware. Salwen’s skills were in communications theory, while his partner, Al Marshall had expertise in hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978 Proteon was contracted by MIT to assist in their development of a local area network for the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). This Arpanet sponsored project became the source of Proteon’s inclusion in the early history of the LAN industry. The networking adapters that Salwen and Marshall developed for the MIT project became Proteon’s initial products. Sold to universities, government agencies and businesses, these early adaptors competed with the first products from other LAN startups, 3Com, U-B and Interlan and fueled Proteon’s growth in ’81 and ‘82. Salwen continued to take on consulting projects, but by late 1982, he believed in the potential of the networking market and in the quality of his token ring network adapters and he made the decision to focus on the LAN market. Salwen had initially avoided all outside capital, preferring to keep control of his company and funding its growth with profits and his own investment, but as the PC market began to take off it became clear that he would need capital to be able to scale his business fast enough to become a market leader. In December,’83, Proteon raised $2.35 million in its initial round of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of IBM’s token ring network, Proteon was poised to take advantage of Big Blue’s late, but powerful entry to the LAN market. Proteon achieved market prominence with the success of their ProNet series of LAN adapters and software, riding the wave of token ring popularity and distancing themselves from the competition with fast, reliable IBM compatible token ring LAN products. Recognizing the opportunity presented by the presence of multiple LAN technologies, Proteon became one of the few networking companies to achieve success in the internetworking market, introducing one of the first multi-protocol gateway in ’85. By 1988, 40% of Proteon’s sales were from gateways and high-speed networking products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview Salwen provides a unique perspective on communications technologies, gained from a career that spanned the three distinct markets of data communications, networking and internetworking. I met Howard in his office at Proteon after attending a board meeting. The interview was short, since I had to catch a flight, but in it, he captures the challenges and excitement of the entrepreneur’s journey from a bootstrapped startup to well-funded industry leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: MIT, Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), Proteon, IBM, token ring, ProNet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/01/102792007-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Howard Salwen Interviewed by James Pelkey 1/28/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Paul-Severino/",

He joined Digital Equipment Corporation in 1967 as a design engineer for industrial control systems. In 1972, he left DEC and joined the start-up Prime Computers and, among other projects, designed a product to interconnect multiple computers. Then in 1976, Severino became a hands-on entrepreneur when he joined the unfunded start-up Data Translations, a company focusing on building data acquisition products. Although the company would become a success, Severino, wanted to head his own company, not just be a key member of management, and resigned in 1979 to find a compelling opportunity. In May 1981, he founded Interlan, an early Ethernet Networking company. By the fall of 1984, success forced the need for more cash and the Board of Directors decided to sell the company. On March 1, 1985, Micom acquired Interlan for $65 million. Severino became Corporate Vice President, Product Planning and Technology. Frustrated in a staff role. Severino resigned in September intent on founding yet another company. In May 1986 he founded Wellfleet, a company to become an early leader in Internetworking and in the years ahead a public company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like only yesterday when Paul and I were sitting in my room in the Hyatt Hotel on the Charles River getting to know each other before beginning the interview. Discovering we had gone to the same college only a few years apart helped thaw any edge that might have existed between us. So with the evening ritual of racing crews practicing on the Charles River in the background, and the sun casting its pale cool orange over the city before disappearing for another day, we talked for a few hours before continuing our conversation over dinner in the restaurant foyer. What struck me were how the entrepreneurial cultures of both Coasts were grounded in the large technology-companies, such as DEC and Prime and Hewlett-Packard and Intel.

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;When I called Bernie Strassburg requesting an interview, I also asked him for a recommendation of one of the key staff members of the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB), he without hesitation named Michael “Mike” Slomin. Mike was no longer with the CCB, but with Bell Communications Research, or Bellcore, the research and development consortium created by the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC’s) post AT&amp;amp;T divestiture on January 1,1984 to effectively replace Bell Laboratories that was retained by AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On entering the corporate lobby of the massive Bellcore headquarters, I asked the receptionist to let Mr. Slomin know I had arrived. I had a short wait, and as we left the busy lobby, I asked if there was a place where I could get a cup of coffee and we could talk privately. He took me to a spacious cafeteria that was empty but for the staff that was cleaning up the luncheon traffic. We took our coffees to a vacant corner where I chugged mine, hoping it would rid me of my yawns and wake me up. And I set up my recorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike shared that he had both a degree in electrical engineering and a JD degree and a LLM in international and trade law. He worked for the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from 1973 until 1979 and then again from 1981 until 1986. In between, he had worked as a lawyer for the Communications Satellite Corp. He had now been with Bellcore for nearly two years. What makes this interview especially valuable is in his words: “In my years at the FCC I wrote all of the registration decisions of the 1970s, those on brief to the Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court, and those decisions were affirmed. I had one of the moderate roles in interpretations of the first Computer Inquiry, [and] in preparing the Notice of Proposed Rule Making of the second Computer Inquiry… I also had major roles in policy decisions having to do with the entry of IBM into communications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I was glad I trusted my instincts and conducted this serendipitous interview. It was challenging at times, and I too often substituted agreement or understanding as a means of keeping Mike talking, for I wanted to make sure I understood his conclusions: read for example the many takes on the importance of Carterfone. One conclusion was certain; it was a heady time for a junior lawyer to be working at the CCB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Common Carrier Bureau, FCC, AT&amp;amp;T, Carterfone, Data Access Arrangement (DAA), Computer Inquiry I, Computer Inquiry II, Hush-A-Phone, PhoneMate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/09/102740208-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mike Slomin Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/10/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bruce-Smith/",

(NET) was in the process of circling their Series C Preferred Stock, it was almost too late to participate. The deal was considered “hot” and if the firm we represented, Montgomery Securities (MS), wanted to get in on it, we knew we had better act quickly. NET was one of a growing number of T1 multiplexer companies that were responding to the recent decision by AT&amp;amp;T to tariff T1 circuits commercially. The compelling financial savings that T1 service made possible for corporations was creating both a windfall and a financial boom. Rick learned we needed to talk to Tom Rota, the CFO, and without delay arranged for a meeting. On arrival, Tom greeted Rick and me and took us through the financial documents and answered our brief questions – the presentation was both thorough and impressive. He next introduced us to Bruce Smith, the president and CEO. Before long, Rick and I glanced at each other and I knew he had concluded as I had that we had to be part of this investment. That meant we had to become the sellers, not the buyers, of ourselves and Montgomery Securities. In ten short minutes, “the deck chairs had been moved.” The more we interacted with Bruce, the more it became patently obvious why the deal was “hot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce took us through the history of how and why he had become unhappy working at COMSAT, despite multiple promotions in his three years with the firm, and then his search for a leadership position in an entrepreneurial startup, preferably in Silicon Valley. Even all the impressive perks he enjoyed, such as a spacious office overlooking Washington D.C., a chauffeured town car service, and a hefty compensation, were not sufficient to keep him engaged. So when he met with the co-founders of NET and discovered their views matched his own, Bruce concluded he had found his new challenging opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our conversation paused as Bruce deliberated whether to include MS in the financing. Fortunately, after we shared MS’s impressive public market trading performance, trading that would benefit NET once they went public, an advantage that venture capital partnerships could not offer, he agreed to take a $2 million investment from MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview in October 1988 was conducted more as two friends having a conversion than as an interviewer learning and confirming facts. Bruce proved to be an outstanding CEO who took NET public in 1987 for a post money valuation of close to $200 million. Throughout our friendship we met frequently, whether in his office, or mine, or having dinner with our spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Network Equipment Technologies (NET), T1 Multiplexer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/03/102792032-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith Interviewed by James Pelkey 10/20/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Mark-Smith/",

Even as a freshman in high school, Smith displayed the presence of mind characteristic of a future leader. On winning a science fair, and the award of a handshake with the famous Wernher Von Braun, he had the chutzpah to ask Braun for a job. He not only got one, but one for every summer of his college years with the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, or ABMA, the predecessor to NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration). On graduating from Georgia Tech in 1962 with a BSEE with Honors, he returned to Huntsville to work for ABMA. When he was invited to join others he had worked with at ABMA to start a new company, to be named Spacecraft Incorporated, later renamed SEI Systems, he didn’t hesitate. It was exciting, but after six or seven years, he concluded he did not want to forge a career built on innovating one-of-a-kind engineering projects, regardless of how successful, but to start a company to manufacture needed products profitably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he and a buddy put up $30K, and they started looking for that unique opportunity. Their first ideas proved too little too late, but not the idea of modems as promised by the Carterfone decision. By August of 1970, they had built ten Bell 202 compatible modems and Smith resigned from SEI Systems, and they founded Universal Data Systems (UDS). The first years were a struggle, and even into the middle of the 1970’s, UDS sold primarily OEM modems – they sold to companies who labeled UDS’s modems as their own. When they introduced their version of a 2400 bps modem, it became a “big seller.” Then Vadic sued them for patent infringement, a suit UDS eventually won. In December 1980, the need for shareholder liquidity motivated UDS’s sale to Motorola for $22.5M. UDS’s revenues were $11M, two/third of which were OEM’s. UDS’s sales slightly lagged those of Vadic’s, their chief competitor, whose revenues were $10M in 1978, the year they were acquired by Racal Electronics for $20M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith retired from UDS in January 1985. Revenues of UDS had grown to $110M. Smith’s integrity, since affirmed by his dealings with Robert Galvin, the Chairman of Motorola, a man whom Smith held in the highest regard, led Smith to promise his new “start” would never compete with UDS, even for personnel. Consequently, George Grumbles (See Interview), the Vice-President of Marketing and Sales, became President of UDS. I interviewed Smith in the corporate headquarters of ADTRAN, his new start founded in 1986, and a short taxi ride from UDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Universal Data Systems (UDS), Motorola, Vadic lawsuit, Vadic, Codex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/10/102738572-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Smith Interviewed by James Pelkey 11/28/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Robert-Smith-&-Thomas-Thompson/",

      "content" : "&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I arrived at the headquarters of General DataComm Industries (GDC), expecting to interview the company’s founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board Charles “Chuck” Johnson, I was informed he was not available. He had, however, made arrangements for two of his subordinates, Vice-President of Corporate Development, Robert Smith and Thomas “Tommy” Thompson, Vice-President of Government and Industry Relations, to meet with me. After they gave me some of Johnson’s background, it became obvious why the telephone industry was a strategic market for GDC. Johnson earned his BSEE from Northwestern University after WWII on the GI Bill. He joined Illinois Bell Telephone, then an independent telephone company, ITT Kellogg, before two jobs with data communication equipment manufacturers. After the Carterfone decision, Johnson and five others including Robert Smith founded GDC in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a long interview that reviews in detail the founding and history of GDC; investigates the relationships of several key customers, e.g. Western Union, Texaco; and industries of focus, e.g. telephone industry, government; and innovations the interviewees were particularly proud of, e.g. front-panel LED diagnostics, loop back testing, LSI technology, and multiplexer technologies. Thompson gives an insider’s view of the events leading up to and following the Carterfone decision then onto the DAA (digital access arrangements) and Part 68 registration and finally the plugs and modular jacks program. I want to highlight the lengthy discussion of the formation and value of the IDCMA (Independent Data Communications and Manufacturers Association). I kept pressing that line of inquiry, for the IDCMA is an important example of collaborative action among competitive organizations. Interestingly, in Thompson’s description of the events at the 1971 ICA Trade Show, another important industry networking event, it is almost possible to see the members walking around the Trade Show floor trying to convene a meeting in one of their hotel rooms once the Show closes for the day, and how each person has to weight doing so against their individual firm priorities (See Art Carr and Matt Kinney Interviews).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: General DataComm (GDC), Carterfone, IDCMA, Western Union, Texaco, Codex, Milgo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/11/102738591-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Smith &amp;amp; Thomas Thompson Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/11/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Bernard-Strassburg/",

On November 22, 1963, he was named Chief of the CCB. At that time, the responsibility of the CCB was largely the regulation of the telephone industry; that meant the regulation of AT&amp;amp;T. Strassburg credits a new staff economist, Dr. Manley Irwin, in conversations in 1965, as introducing him to “some of the things that were happening in the outside world where communications and computers were converging.” In 1966, Strassburg innovated the use of a Public Inquiry that began, as he would later title a book he co-authored, A Slippery Slope: The Long Road to the Breakup of AT&amp;amp;T. The story of the years after the first Public Inquiry are briefly reconstructed in the book found on the Computer History Museum website. The fact is, the history of computer communication might have played out very differently without the heroic actions of Bernard Strassburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurial actions are not limited to the starting of new enterprises as Strassburg amply demonstrated. It was an honor to interview him and to have captured in his words the story of the deregulation and breakup of AT&amp;amp;T, at the time the largest corporation in the world. Although he had retired years earlier, he arranged to have a room in the CCB offices for our hour and a half interview. As I walked down the large marble hallways, and then paused before opening the formal wooden doorway, I took some deep breathes. Inside the gated wooden dividers made me think of attorney offices of old that I had seen in pictures. I was quickly directed to the waiting Strassburg. I could hardly imagine, as I looked around, that once, as Strassburg would reflect: “My office was sort of the balance for this industry.” He is one of the unsung heroes of the beginnings of the Information Economy. Strassburg and Betty Henck’s book is a very informative read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: FCC, Common Carrier Bureau (CCB), AT&amp;amp;T, Computer Inquiry I &amp;amp; II&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/11/102738016-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bernard Strassburg Interviewed by James Pelkey 5/3/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Robert-Taylor/",

After working as an engineer for several aircraft and defense companies, he joined NASA’s Office of Advanced Research and Technology as a project manager in 1962. That same year Taylor met J. C. R. Licklider who, like Taylor, had done graduate work in psychoacoustics. Licklider’s vision of computing would influence much of Taylor’s work and together they helped chart a course for the future of computing. In a paper they co-published in ’68, they predicted what few could see at the time: “The programmed digital computer…can change the nature and value of communication even more profoundly than did the printing press and the picture tube.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1965 Taylor went to work at the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the next year took over as director of ARPA’s Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). In his office he had 3 terminals that each connected him to a different time sharing system under ARPA’s sponsorship. The fact that these systems couldn’t connect to each other gave him the inspiration to envision a system where users in one system could communicate with anyone connected to the system. With this goal in mind, he approached ARPA’s director, Charles Herzfeld, who liked the idea and immediately gave him funding to pursue what would eventually become the Arpanet project. Taylor attempted to recruit Larry Roberts to head the project. Despite Roberts’ repeated refusals to re-locate to the D.C. area, Taylor’s dogged persistence, including an appeal to Roberts’ boss at Lincoln Labs, won out and Roberts finally accepted the position. In Taylor’s words, he was able to “blackmail him into fame”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving IPTO he taught briefly at the University of Utah. He then joined Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1970, to help start and run their Computer Science Laboratory. From 1970 to 1983 Taylor managed a series of influential projects at Xerox PARC including the development of Ethernet. Taylor’s success was as much due to his strength of vision as it was to his skill in managing highly talented engineers and scientists. Alan Kay, who worked with Taylor at PARC, describes Taylor’s leadership: “He created maximum synergy in the room.” Fiercely protective of his staff, Taylor kept them as isolated as possible from the meddling of management above him. When a young graduate student, Robert Metcalfe, was hired to connect PARC to the Arpanet, Taylor allowed him to take several months at the University of Hawaii to collect data on their ALOHAnet project, in order to finish his PhD thesis. The data Metcalfe gathered in Hawaii proved helpful in the ultimate design of Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Taylor left Xerox PARC to join Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) where he started the Systems Research Center (SRC). I met Taylor at the research center for this interview. Unfortunately, our meeting was cut short by the arrival of unexpected guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: ARPA, IPTO, Arpanet, Xerox PARC, DEC, SRC, Ethernet, Networking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/12/102738691-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Taylor Interviewed by James Pelkey 6/16/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Ralph-Ungermann/",

From his early days at Collins Radio where he oversaw operation of a local and wide area network that predated commercial LAN/WAN technology by a decade, he has been at the forefront of computer communications throughout the early history of networking systems architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ungermann received a B.S.E.E from University of California, Berkeley and his Masters in Computer Architecture from the University of California, Irvine. He then joined Collins Radio in 1967 where he was responsible for the LAN portion of the MOS factory in Newport Beach, CA. In 1970, he left Collins for Western Digital to help develop and bring to market the first UART chip. He then took a job with Intel reporting to Federico Faggin. At Intel, he was responsible for microprocessor development and his team developed the USART and the I/O chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the economic downturn of 1974 Ungermann and Faggin left Intel, with plans to start a business together.  They were soon approached by Exxon Enterprises, which persuaded Ungermann and Faggin to start Zilog, Inc. that same year to develop microprocessors and communication chips. By 1978, Zilog was growing rapidly on the success of their Z-80 microprocessor and communication and I/O chips. Despite their success, in 1978, Exxon decided to “fold” their investments in computer companies together; an idea strongly resisted by Ungermann.  Due to the rift between Ungermann and Exxon management, he was asked to leave at the end of 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expecting such an outcome, Ungermann had already begun exploring his options, and in July 1979, Ungermann and fellow Zilog ex-employee, Charlie Bass, incorporated Ungermann-Bass (U-B). With the aid of new engineers, especially John Davidson, and a marketing and sales executive, James Jordon, they closed their first round of venture capital financing of $1.5 Million.  Ungermann crafted a vendor independent networking strategy that required U-B to master the breadth of Ethernet, Token Ring, even Token Bus and broadband technologies. To do so required U-B to acquire other companies, such as Amdax in January 1983 and Linkware in February 1986. Ungermann’s strategy would also require U-B to always have excess capital on hand: it became the first Ethernet LAN company to go public, for example, raising $28.5 Million of cash on June 23, 1983 with a valuation of $288 Million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June of 1984, U-B proposed to General Electric a MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) joint venture.  In October, despite skepticism from their own board, Ungermann and Jordan succeeded in closing the deal: in October 1984, Industrial Networking, Inc. (INI) was created with great promise. At around the same time U-B also released their PC product, Net/One. Ungermann’s vendor-independent strategy seemed prescient; but sales were flat and in March 1985, U-B reported a $2M loss.  U-B’s focus on large-scale high-end network services for large, mainframe businesses left them late to the game of PC networking.  Their financial woes were exacerbated by the Stock Market crash of October 1987 and in early 1988, Ungermann pursued talks with Tandem Computers, reasoning that an association with a large and reputable computer manufacturer would give them the stability they needed to reach bigger clients. In February 1988 Tandem acquired U-B for $260 Million. Ungermann became a Vice-President and Board Member of Tandem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Ungermann sheds light on some of the key strategies and decisions that led to success or failure for the companies he worked for and ran, and those he competed against.   His discussions focus more on overall business strategies than they do on management decisions and the personnel. They reveal a leadership style motivated by a strong desire to compete on a level equal to the major players of the day: this goal of achieving a market position on par with IBM, DEC and AT&amp;amp;T, is clearly evident in the discussion of his decision to merge U-B with Tandem, which had only just been finalized in the months preceding this interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Collins Radio, Western Digital, Intel, Zilog, Ungermann-Bass (UB), Industrial Networking, DCA, Tandem Computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/03/102738765-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ralph Ungermann Interviewed by James Pelkey 7/19/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Dan-Warmenhoven/",

Warmenhoven started at IBM immediately after graduation, working on distributed systems and communications systems for projects like the IBM Series I and the IBM 3790. In 1977 he moved to the Communications Products Division in Raleigh, NC, where he worked on the remote job entry (RJE) package for the IBM 8100, the host computer for IBM’s distributed processing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ’79, Warmenhoven was transferred to the newly established Network Products division, under development manager Murray Bolt. This new division was tasked with developing system independent communications products. Warmenhoven’s first responsibility was engineering manager of the IBM 3710 Network Controller. In 1980, following the announcement of the Ethernet standard by DIX (the consortium of DEC, Intel, and Xerox), IBM established a task force to formulate a response to this innovation in local area networking. Warmenhoven was part of this task force, and in mid ’81 he became manager of the System Design and Architecture division, in charge of managing the implementation of IBM’s token ring alternative to Ethernet across multiple IBM products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmenhoven describes the decision of IBM’s senior management to select an alternative to Ethernet for its networking solution, remembering the mindset of management regarding Ethernet and the DIX consortium: “It wouldn’t be so bad if it was Xerox only, but having DEC in the fray, that was like a declaration of war. I mean, the Axis Powers had formed, and so it had to be, IBM had to have a different solution.” He recounts important decisions in the development of the IBM token ring product, including the need to integrate with IBM’s existing communication technology, SNA (System Network Architecture); how to solve the problem of multiple existing cabling systems; and the requirement of token ring to be available for non-IBM device attachment. This last requirement was anathema to the company’s long-standing practice of offering only proprietary technology. It also led to IBM signing an agreement with Texas Instruments in December 1982 to produce a token ring chipset for the open market, and to propose a token ring standard to the IEEE 802 committee responsible for networking standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Dan at my home office in Atherton. He had left IBM in ’83 and was then working at HP. In the interview, he spoke frankly and without any apparent bias toward his former employer. This interview provides a valuable perspective on the response of IBM, the major incumbent of the computer industry, to the disruptive technological shift brought on by the entrepreneurs of local area networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: IBM, token ring, 3710 Network Controller, System Network Architecture (SNA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/02/102792020-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dan Warmenhoven Interviewed by James Pelkey 3/9/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Stuart-Wecker/",

There were other protocols that played important roles, particularly the protocols of Xerox that influenced the evolution of DARPA’s TCP/IP. (I discuss the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) suite of protocols and its predecessor PARC Universal Packet (PUP, or Pup) protocols with Yogen Dalal in our interview. DECnet was innovated within DEC, and first released in 1975. Herein I discuss is innovation with its author Stuart Wecker. The integration of DECnet into DEC’s VAX line of computers would transform DEC into a networking market leader in the 1980’s. IBM released its Systems Network Architecture (SNA) in the early 1970’s, and while undoubtedly important, evolved independently until the late 1980’s when market dynamics forced alignment with OSI. The decisions within IBM are given cursory review within the Robert Donnan and Daniel Warmenhoven interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Stuart Wecker describes his arrival at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and his work with a variety of networking products: including the Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP) and the DECnet networking architecture. Wecker recalls the strong influence of Donald Davies, Derek Barber, and Bob Metcalfe on his thinking, as well as the precedents of the American Arpanet and French Cyclades networks. Wecker contrasts the peer-to-peer design of DECnet to the hierarchical design of IBM’s Systems Network Architecture, and establishes how this peer-to-peer strategy was defined before the design and marketing of DEC’s VAX line in the mid-1970s. Wecker also reflects on related technical issues, including DEC’s approach to routing and congestion control, integration with Ethernet technologies, and the combination of datagram and virtual circuit approaches within DECnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was unaware of the importance of Stuart Wecker until my interview with Gordon Bell. When I reached Stu, he had left DEC and had become President of Technology Concepts in Sudbury, MA. I will always remember the red brick walls typical of a cotton-weaving mill and the unusual number of interruptions that I attribute to his new role in a new organization. This interview became a technical discussion of his networking philosophies and the uniqueness of DECnet. I felt his generous gift of time was our early realization that we had both gone to: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), communication protocols, DECnet, Arpanet, VAX, peer-to-peer architecture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/04/102738130-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stuart Wecker Interviewed by James Pelkey 10/25/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/James-White/",

White was responsible for programming the operating system for the Culler-Fried System, an early timesharing system. When UCSB was selected as one of the first four Arpanet nodes, White was chosen to program the interface to the Interface Message Processor (IMP). At this time, he joined the community of other graduate students tasked with connecting mainframes to the Arpanet IMPs. The group began gathering for regular meetings under Steve Crocker’s Network Working Group (NWG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ’72, White was recruited to work at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Douglas Engelbart’s Augmentation Research Center (ARC), another original Arpanet node and the Network Information Center for Arpanet. As electronic mail was becoming more popular over Arpanet, based on Ray Tomlinson’s SendMessage program for the TENEX operating system, Larry Roberts requested the formalization of rules for all email messaging on the network. White joined a group of developers to create those rules, which, among other things, established an early protocol for sending mail that would later become Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). At SRI, White also gained valuable experience in messaging software while working on the SRI internal email system called The Journal, an early hypertext record storage that catalogued Arpanet publications, including RFC’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ’77, White was invited by Robert Metcalfe to join Xerox PARC. Metcalfe knew White from the NWG meetings and recruited him to manage the communications software group in the Systems Development Department (later, the Office Products Division). The group included influential software engineers Yogen Dalal and Will Crowther, among others, and was responsible for the development of the email system for the Xerox Alto, as well as the networking protocol suite, XNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late ’78, Dave Liddle sent White to attend the first meeting of what would become the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 6.5 in Montreal. The group began discussions to develop an international email messaging protocol. Later they moved their efforts to the CCITT, where White, along with Doug Steedman, were influential in providing the technical architecture for X.400, the OSI email messaging standard first published in 1984. After finishing work on X.400, White joined 3Com to work on their X.400 mail product, but development of the product was delayed several times and in ’86, White left to join Telenet.

He was still embroiled in a contentious lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors against Paradyne and eight current or former executives, including him. The 14-count indictment charged the defendants with lying, offering bribes and defrauding the government to win a $115-Million contract with the U.S. Social Security Administration. In 1987, Paradyne settled the federal criminal charges for $1.2 Million in fines and by ousting its chairman and president, Robert Wiggins. Bob was unwilling to rehash any of those events in an interview. Not surprisingly, Paradyne continued to mount loses, even on strong sales of $232.6 Million in 1987, due in large measure to the heavy legal costs incurred fighting the federal investigation. When losses continued into 1988, Paradyne found itself the subject of acquisition interests. Bob had no interest in discussing these events, either. So I had to assure him, that I only wanted to understand the history of Paradyne, particularly in comparison to the histories of its two key competitors, Codex and Milgo, not the lawsuits nor potential corporate suitors. With those agreements, Bob finally agreed to be interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to honor Bob’s wishes even as I was curious as to what had changed. When I met Bob at the Alex. Brown &amp;amp; Sons investment conference in March 1983, he had been at the top of “his game.” To possibly gain insight as to why the changes, I asked Jay Hill, a mutual friend and also someone I had interviewed, to gain some perspective. In his words, here is Jay Hill on Robert Wiggins:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I first met Bob Wiggins in 1976 when I was interviewing for VP of Sales and Marketing for Paradyne. At the time, Paradyne was a sub $5 million company and not well known. Bob had been there just two years and was struggling to find growth, but had a vision for the company that was both intriguing and persuasive. Even though there was risk involved in joining an unproven company, Bob was such an impressive person, I hopped on board and moved to Florida – a decision I never regretted. I had reason to in late ’76 when our largest customer, Datran, filed for bankruptcy. Bob never showed concern and guided us out of the crises and soon we were growing again.&lt;br /&gt;Bob had a solid background with IBM and GTE before joining Paradyne. Yet it was his entrepreneurial spirit that led the company from $2.5 million to $300 million during his tenure. He balanced his leadership attributes as a strong taskmaster - setting aggressive goals for all around him - with being a coach – and pulling alongside a teammate or group to help them solve a problem or encourage them to go further. He also had a penchant for technological achievement and kept Paradyne either at the top, or close to it, with the most advanced products in the market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Lease-Line Modems, Datran; Codex, Racal-Milgo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/09/102740209-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Wiggins Interviewed by James Pelkey 11/29/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Art-Wilkes/",

Company founder, Jack Scantlin, had invented a state-of-the art frequency division multiplexer (FDM) capable of connecting 150 terminals to a single shared phone line. When Wilkes was offered a significant salary raise to work for SE, he accepted, becoming lead salesman for the Quotron system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At SE he sold multiplexers to businesses that used teletype, telegraph and other slower-rate terminals, allowing them to combine these connections over single phone lines. One customer, Allen-Babcock, was interested in using multiplexers for their new timesharing service. Wilkes saw the opportunity and acted on it. He left Scantlin with an agreement to give up his stock options in return for the licensing rights to a new time division multiplexer (TDM), a significant improvement over FDM, that Scantlin had been developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the idea for a TDM, he recruited his former college roommate, Bill Norred, to join him. When Norred and his new bride arrived at Wilkes’ doorstep in 1968, Wilkes had to inform Norred that the financing he had secured had fallen through. So rather than find their own apartment, Norred and his bride moved into Wilkes’ den and the two partners began working in Wilkes’ garage. Over the course of the next six months, Norred and Wilkes completed a working prototype of the 660 multiplexer, the flagship product of American Data Systems (ADS). They incorporated ADS that spring. Allen-Babcock became one of their first customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an investment of $100,000 from Wilkes’ neighbor and the addition of Bob Schaaf, a former colleague from Scantlin, as head of sales, ADS was off and running. Their timing couldn’t have been better; in addition to the demand for sharing communication lines, timesharing computing was also taking hold. ADS grew quickly and by 1970 had sales of $5 million. In an effort to increase their product line they made an agreement with Rockwell International, which had developed an automatically equalized 4800 bps modem, to license the modem for controlling ownership of the company. The modem didn’t work, however, and the struggle to get it working left them low on cash and behind Codex and Milgo, which had introduced similar modems. When the timesharing business began to dry up in the following year, and the economy took a downturn, ADS saw orders cancelled and a slump in sales. Having purchased ADS competitor, Collins Radio, The Rockwell controlled board decided to trim ADS down to a shell and replaced Wilkes with a new president from Rockwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Wilkes offers unique insights on the early development of data communications, both as a manager with the largest communications company of the day, and as one of the early entrepreneurial success stories of the new data com market. His work with AT&amp;amp;T gave him specific understanding of the potential future of communications. He recollects one early study done by an AT&amp;amp;T study group that asked: “Will, by the year 2000, we have ‘a terminal per person?’” His work with the FCC to help ease tariffs for new data communications technology put him at the forefront of technology and regulation, giving him unique knowledge and understanding that he applied effectively to his startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: AT&amp;amp;T; Scantlin Electronics; Quotron; American Data Systems (ADS); Frequency Division multiplexer; Time Division Multiplexer; Rockwell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/07/102738826-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Art Wilkes Interviewed by James Pelkey 5/9/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/interviews/Hubert-Zimmerman/",

He is most widely known for his efforts in establishing the OSI Reference Model as a standard for networking communications. While his technical understanding of the problems at hand was essential, so too was his ability to sense and understand the political and economic forces at play in an arena where so many disparate interests butted heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educated at École Polytechnique and Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Telecom, Zimmerman began his career doing research on operating systems for the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (INRIA). His work contributed to the development of the ChorusOS operating systems. While at INRIA, he worked closely with Louis Pouzin on the development of France’s CYCLADES network. In 1980, he moved to the research laboratory of the French Postes, Télégraphes et Telephones (PTT), the Centre National d’Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET). In 1987, he co-founded Chorus Systems with Michel Gien to commercialize ChorusOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an early member of the International Network Working Group (INWG), Zimmerman contributed to the effort of establishing a datagram oriented Host-to-Host protocol standard. In IFIP working group 6.1, he collaborated with Vint Cerf, Roger Scantlebury and Alex McKenzie to write a version of End-to-End protocol that was adopted by networks throughout Europe, though it would not be adopted by the Arpanet community, who were by that time heavily invested in the development of TCP. Between 1978 and 1984, Zimmerman was instrumental in the development and eventual ISO approval of the OSI Reference Model as an international standard for the layering of data communication protocols. Though there was strong opposition to making a theoretical model an international standard, Zimmerman foresaw the value of establishing agreement on the basic underlying architecture for future protocols. Motivated by what he had learned from earlier standards making efforts, Zimmerman’s persistence and leadership proved essential in the eventual adoption of the OSI Reference Model. As Charles Bachman, the chair of ISO sc16 described of Zimmerman, “he was one of the very most important people on that committee, maybe the most important person, in terms of the contributions to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To interview Zimmerman, I took a cab to the commercial area of Paris, where Chorus Systems was headquartered. The windows in his office commanded a dramatic view of Paris. After his helpful interview, I took the Métro back to my hotel near Hyde Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: INWG, IFIP, OSI, ISO, End-to-End protocol, TCP/IP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/01/102738698-05-01-acc.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hubert Zimmerman Interviewed by James Pelkey 5/25/88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","next" : "/section/1.0/Introduction/",
