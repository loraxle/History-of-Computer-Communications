Excelanâ€™s exclusivity of the intelligent Ethernet controller market niche would be brief. For Communication Machinery Corporation (CMC) would announce similar products in early 1983. Larry Green, Dave Oster and Dale Taylor founded CMC on February 5, 1981 providing design engineering services to firms marketing communication systems. In 1982 they received a contract from Associated Computer Consultants (ACC) to design and build an emulator for the LANCE Ethernet chip. ACC held the contract with AMD. CMC would work closely with AMD and DEC the originator of the project. Here, DEC was motivating the creation of an Ethernet chip in competition with Intel, their partner in DIX. By year-end 1982, CMC had raised $2.5 million of venture capital.<a name="fnloc11" href="#fn11">11</a>
