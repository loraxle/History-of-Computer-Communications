      Mulvenna remembers that OSINET: “Came along slowly because General Motors and others were promoting Autofact ‘85 at that time. In fact, all of our technical people were working on the IP Test System and refining the transport test system pre-Autofact ‘85.”

The 1980s marked the beginning of the computer industry’s massive trade shows, epitomized by COMDEX. The power of such events did not escape the notice of the promoters of Internetworking standards and products. The chief promoters of the era’s two Internetworking approaches—OSI and TCP/IP—held significant public demonstrations in 1988, on a larger scale than previous gatherings such as the NBS Implementors workshops and Dan Lynch’s TCP/IP Vendors Workshop. Both events shared the same purpose: to convince customers that their quests for network interoperability were over. (See Exhibit 12.12 ENE and Interop)
