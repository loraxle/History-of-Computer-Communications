General DataComm, first to market a T-1 multiplexer in 1977, dominated the market in 1983. Then they acted aggressively in signing an OEM contract with Cohesive Networks in 1985. Only poor execution and then the loss of the Cohesive Networks contract due to its acquisition by DCA, suddenly dropped General DataComm into a weak fourth place.

Infotron meandered as well with first its own limited product, then the hopeful investment in NSS, and then more feeble attempts on its own.

NSS never could get product to market. In the spring of 1987, Bolt Beranek and Newman – the BBN of Arpanet – bought NSS for $18 million.

Paradyne and Milgo released press announcements and sold product OEMed from others or their own limited-functionality products and never became market forces.
