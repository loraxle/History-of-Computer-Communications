In 1978, the attractiveness of venture capital received a shot in the arm that transformed the industry from having lived on life-support for seven years to a robust institution. The 1978 Revenue Act reduced the capital gains rate from 49 1/2% to 28%. The flow of monies into venture capital funds jumped from $68 million to nearly $1 billon. Then in 1979, Congress passed the ERISA “Prudent Man” Rule that allowed pension funds to invest in venture capital. Again, venture capital benefited. By 1983, new commitments exceeded $5 billion.

For entrepreneurs needing venture capital it was if the stoplight that had been stuck on red had turned green. The impact on networking would be immediate.
