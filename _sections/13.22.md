In February 1987, Salomon Brothers issued a comprehensive report titled: “Telecommunications Equipment – The United States Market.” The section on T-1 Multiplexers reads in part:

>The T1 Multiplexer market is booming. We project annual revenue growth of 25% in 1987 and 1988…The T1 multiplexer market is highly competitive. For typical T1 network users, the need to minimize risk of network failure takes precedence; consequently, product selection is based on reliability first, functionality next, and then price. Market leader Timeplex is being challenged at the fastest-growing high end of the market by more innovative products that are richer in features such as four-to-one voice compression, voice/data integration, complex network management, and intelligent switching.<a name="fnloc20" href="#fn20">20</a>
