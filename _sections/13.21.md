In December 1986, Alex. Brown & Sons issued a report titled: “T-1 Multiplexing Reaches a New Dimension.” They wrote enthusiastically about the market:

>We believe the major long-term beneficiaries of the T-1 marketplace have emerged. It is unlikely that a company without sufficient market share among the Fortune 1000 by 1988 will be able to gain sufficient installations in the future…This means that, in the long, T-1 vendors must gain sufficient revenues and installations prior to growing these installations by selling a variety of additional communications gear... The opportunity presented by the need to sell more than just wide-area networking products (T-1 multiplexers), but the need to become a “complete product offering” by selling additional local-area networking products.
