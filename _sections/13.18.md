In July 1986, Datapro began coverage of T-1 multiplexers with its report “All About T1 Multiplexers.”

>We began to see a flurry of activity in the T1 multiplexer market in 1983, soon after the tariffing of High Capacity Terrestrial Digital Facility in 1982. The subsequent availability, in 1984, of T1 facilities for commercial use turned the “flurry of activity” in a boom. Now, in 1986, we can define a distinctly separate and rapidly expanding market segment for T1 multiplexers that are used in data communications.<a name="fnloc19" href="#fn19">19</a>
