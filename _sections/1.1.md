Starting a company does not always begin with a grand vision of the future. Sometimes the motivation can be wanting simply to do what one enjoys most. Other times it might be the unwillingness to work for others. More often it is some odd combination of reasoning and feeling that is less important that having acted, as if what else would one have done. Such was the case for Jim Cryer and Arthur Kohlenberg in 1962 when their employer, Melpar Electronics, informed them that they were closing the advanced research laboratory they had been running as director and chief scientist, respectively. Even though offered the option to move to Virginia, both men had little desire to leave the Boston area. Rather they believed that they could win technology development contracts being let by government agencies. So they incorporated a new company, Codex, and joined thousands of other companies swept up in the Federal government's funding of technology innovation.
