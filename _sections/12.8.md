DEC management recognized the importance of LANs early. Their participation as a key member of DIX, active involvement in IEEE 802, and a leader in selling minicomputers into the engineering workstation market all compelled DEC to sell LAN products. In May 1982, DEC announced Phase IV of its evolving network architecture (Digital Network Architecture) that would support Ethernet. In March 1983, DEC began shipping its first Ethernet controller for their Unibus (DEUNA). A steady release of more Ethernet controllers and terminal servers, especially the DEC Server 100 in 1984, made DEC a formidable competitor. No longer could Ethernet start-ups feast on the DEC customer base.
